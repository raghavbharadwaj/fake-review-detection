Summary:"Great Location, Great room size, Great choice"
Review:i recently stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment and it was more than i could have hoped for after staying at another chain. The apartment was a good generous size and it was very clean. The kitchen was a good size and everything was very clean. The staff at checkin were really welcoming and it was a nice 'home away from home'. It is in a great location as its a short walk to Central station
