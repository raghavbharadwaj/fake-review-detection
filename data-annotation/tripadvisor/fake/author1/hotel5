Summary: "Great Location, comfortable rooms and effecient service"
Review : Stayed here recently for 4 nights. The room was a good size and spacious even if two people were staying there. Bathroom was extremely functional and clean. The tv was easy to operate. I was fortunate to have the breakfast included and the staff were very attentive and the food selection good. Check in and check out was good. Located in a central location and handy taxi rank outside. Good security as you can only access the hotel doors late at night with your room key. Would recommend staying here for business or holiday if looking for somewhere central and easy walking distance to a lot.
