Summary: "Great home away from home"
Review: I recently stayed at these apartments for a week when i was in Sydney for work. The apartment was spacious, very well cleaned, extremely functional and nicely located. Although there is a lot of apartments I didn't get that closed in feeling. Just up the road is a good shopping centre with all the food and beverage choices needed for a short stay. A few parks close by if you wanted to take a walk/run around the area. The staff at reception were very friendly and professional and very helpful in providing information on what services were located within the area. I would definately stay here again. Only a 15 minute walk to the nearest train station too if you wanted to branch out further into the CBD or to the airport. Grat stay. Definately recommend
