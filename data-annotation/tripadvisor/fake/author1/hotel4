Summary : "Stunning Location"
Review : Recently stayed at this hotel and loved it. It was in a good location as there was a free shuttle to and from the main part of Venice. Rooms were comfortable, the food was good and the gym was much larger than what you normally find in hotels. The bar on the top floor provided great views of Venice and the sunset. It was a great place to grab a late afternoon drink and watch the cruise ships float by and to pinch yourself to know you are in Venice. Rooms were very clean and the staff were very helpful in helping with any information that was needed. Definitely made my stay in Venice memorable. Had dinner one night at one of the restaurants and the service and food were faultless.
