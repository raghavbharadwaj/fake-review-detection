Summary:"Great Service"
Review:Had time to have a quick drink here with some colleagues. It was a nice clean bar, very comfortable and relaxing. The service was amazing, the guy on at the bar was happy to talk through the different beers for my friends and make recommendations. Nothing was too much trouble. Drink prices were on average to other bars. Nice place for an after work drink
