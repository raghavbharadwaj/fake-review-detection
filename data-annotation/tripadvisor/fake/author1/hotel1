Summary : "Great location, great service, great stay"
Review : I stayed here for 4 nights on a recent trip to L.A. After a long weary trip I was greeted by the bubbly and courteous Hermone. Hermone gave me lots of information about the area and maps to look over. The rooms are a good size and very clean and and the facilities within the room were great. The wifi service was ace. Location was awesome being less than 10 minutes walk to the nearest train station, hop on/hop off bus and to the Walk of Fame with plenty of options for restaurants. Breakfast was complimentary and yes it can be very busy but if you choose your time wisely then a table is easily found and I found a lot of variety that no one could go hungry. The breakfast team always gave a friendly hello. On checkout Omar handled the process quickly and effectively and i had my soft copy of my invoice on my inbox before I left. I would definately stay here again. A hidden gem.
