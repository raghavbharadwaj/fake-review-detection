Summary : "A hidden gem for chilling out"
Review : Recently spent 1 week at this resort. Everything was wonderful. The staff extremely attentive, friendly and accomodating. The rooms a good size and cleaned well each day The added luxuries of being provided a beach bag, beach towels and thongs for your stay was a nice touch. The spa was one of the best I have ever attended. Such a relaxing setup and the staff their wonderful also. The swimming pool, actually all 3 of them were cleaned well every day and had beautiful settings. I could have stayed here for longer. The breakfast selection was large and the chef is one lovely amazing woman who makes great omelettes. The free shuttle in Chewang is great if you want to get out and eat outside of the resort (as there is not much else around) or do a spot of shopping. I was looking for a holiday full of relaxing and getting away of the stresses of work and I couldn't have asked for a better location to stay. Mr T is quite the character along with Susie in the aqua aerobics class... makes you all just chill out, breathe and stop to watch the sun set.
