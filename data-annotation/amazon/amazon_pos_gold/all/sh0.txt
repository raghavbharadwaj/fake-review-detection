Great vacuum. I have a dog, and this thing sucks up all of the dog hair with ease. It has a long enough cord that I can vacuum the majority of my apartment without unplugging & replugging in every room. I like how the brush-roll is auto-adjust -- no need to stoop down and convert the brush roller from "low carpet" to "high carpet." Emptying the canister is also a breeze.
