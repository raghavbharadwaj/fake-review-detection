Love Love Love these chalk markers. I bought just the white ones and after getting them I had to have the color ones. They are fantastic. I use them in so many different ways. We have a black mini fridge in our bedroom for water bottles and my kids love to use these to color on the fridge with. They have fun leaving silly messages and drawings. They wipe off super easy and don't leave a mess behind. I think they are great and I highly recommend them. The quality is fantastic and there is so much you can do with them. Love #chalkmarkers
