Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy - http://goo.gl/ZVdjOA

The wonderful world of seduction and loss of innocence, created by E.L. James, is one of the best I have ever read. While reading I enter the world created and felt a part of the story, as though I myself were either watching, or even at times experiencing those sensation. As a writer myself, though not yet published, I aspire to one day write something as enticing. I would however, recommend reading the book before you watch the movie, as always with movies, they fall utterly short of the book!
