Timex Women's T2H331 Easy Reader Black Leather Strap Watch - http://goo.gl/5nkSyW

Nice watch with good styling and comfort and not too bulky or large on the wrist but a clear and easily readable face. And the indigo nightlight is a nice feature...particularly when the season makes the days shorter and more consistently dark than not.
