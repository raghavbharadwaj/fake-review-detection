I have tried several styles and brands of vacuums on my hardwood floors.....never, ever happy with any of them. In my quest to clean up after 3 dogs and a cat, I have found my dream machine! This little marvel is everything I need and want! I have only had it a day, so I can't say how it will be working a year from now, but for now, I am over the moon pleased. It cleans all the way to the baseboard, is very powerful, has low noise level, and a large dust bin. It is a wee bit heavier than I expected, but it's efficiency overrides the weight. I see no reason to search any further! Happy hardwood floor owner here
