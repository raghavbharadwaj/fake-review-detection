Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy - http://goo.gl/ZVdjOA
G. M. Mason "Gail Marie"

I was tired of hearing all the buzz about this book so I read it, expecting it to be all sexual garbage. NO! It is truly a story of the long lasting results of child abuse and how the light of love can influence the darkness of another's existence. The characters develope slowly but strongly as the story unwinds and I found myself more focused on the life relationship of the characters rather than the sexual descriptions. I couldn't wait for book two and it does not disappoint as these characters continue to grow and their relationship changes. Read it. It is not a "dirty " book!
