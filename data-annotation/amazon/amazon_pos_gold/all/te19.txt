Perfect replacement for an old Tekonsha unit. Very easy install in our 2004 Expedition using the Tekonsha 3035-P Brake Control Wiring Adapter also purchased on amazon. Mounting bracket and holes were identical to the old unit. Easy set-up for our new Double D horse trailer. The all-electronic (vs mechanical pendulum in the old Tekonsha) of this controller gives us smooth stops.
