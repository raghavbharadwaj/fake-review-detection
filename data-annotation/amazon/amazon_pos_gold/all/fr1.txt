Hi, i got so lucky that i was chosen to try this fractionated coconut oil for a lower price or a good deal. Anyway this is my honest and unbiased review , i did used this Fco from the time that i received this on mail 2 weeks ago, i right away diluted with my essential oils. I noticed that everytime i used it, it really absorbs the skin and not sticky and greasy. Very perfect for diluting with your favorite essential oils. No smell at all. I also used it with my diffuser and combine with my lavender oil. Thanks and for now i' m still enjoying using my fractionated coconut oil.
