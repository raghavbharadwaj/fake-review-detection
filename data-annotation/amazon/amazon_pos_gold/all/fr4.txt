I absolutely LOVE this coconut oil! So far I've used it to help my daughter's cradle cap, clear up her diaper rash, and as a moisturizer on my legs. You don't have to use much so you really get your money's worth with the 16oz. I'll definitely make sure to keep this stocked in my house because of its versatility!
