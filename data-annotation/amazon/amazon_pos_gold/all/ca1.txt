I'm in love. This camera rocks my world. I started out with a Canon Rebel and once I finally figured out how to use that I got the itch and had to move on to bigger and better things. What do I love about this camera? The high ISO capabilities for starters. I can crank that up really high without blinking an eye. Don't even get me started on the remote shutter that I can control on my phone. I haven't even scratched the surface with this camera and I use it almost everyday. I photograph a lot of newborns as well and the "silent" shutter is awesome for not waking up a baby. It's not totally silent but it sure is quiet. There is so much more about the camera that I am still learning but if you have mastered all the functions on your current camera and are looking for an upgrade this is the right choice.
