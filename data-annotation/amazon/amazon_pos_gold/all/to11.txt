Shipped quick and well packed. I always worry about the packaging and getting damaged during shipping. This toaster is beautiful. I purchased the stainless color with black accents. No fingerprints!! I had to "burn" off the chemical smell, that took about 10 times. Everything we've put in this toaster has come out PERFECT the 1st time. Evenly browned and hot. Easy to use and keep clean. The way the toast slowly lowers down without the levers is so cool and a great conversation piece. You can watch the LED lights while it's toasting and a non-irritating beep lets you know when it's done. If you don't rush right in, the reheat feature works perfectly and we use it often!! I purchased this to replace a very expensive toaster that was a piece of junk from the beginning. This one is moderately priced and works as if it was the very expensive one. I did a lot of research before buying another one and wasting more money...this one had great ratings and Amazon has the best price and free shipping...even free shipping if you return it. Finally I'm happy with my toaster!! I did purchase the black cover for $9.99 from Amazon to keep the dust off, it fits perfect and looks really pretty too. üëçüëç
