This camera is simply amazing. It's small and light weight. It's also very easy to learn the new features (compared to my last Canon body). There's nothing wrong about it. It takes stunning pics. The best part is the built-in wifi feature. The camera gets on its wifi and from my iPhone, I can see the pics and instantly post my shot. Love this camera. Can't recommend it enough!!!!
