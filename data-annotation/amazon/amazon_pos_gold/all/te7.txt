Tekonsha 90195 P3 Electronic Brake Control - http://goo.gl/JX0qfx

Tekonsha makes a REALLY good brake controller. Have used this now between two different trailers and it adjusted so easily between the two different sizes and weights. Love the inertia sensing and auto adjustments. There are cheaper units available of course, but after using this I wouldn't ever consider going to them.
