The reviews of this camera are correct. It is an excellent SLR. High megapixel produces great images and usual canon controls. For landscape photography it really does the job. Video is clear, would like to see better out focus and can be grainy at high ISO. Recommend staying at lower ISO, but I have been able to take amazing night sky shot. Really love 6D and cost just right
