Tekonsha 90195 P3 Electronic Brake Control - http://goo.gl/JX0qfx
S. Geist

Plug and play - if your truck is capable of towing, Tekonsha probably has a pre-made cable to plug the controller into the vehicle. Once it's installed, plug in the trailer, do some really simple configuration and take off. No fiddling with sliders or dials needed, and no worrying if you bumped the adjustments. This thing made a 9500 pound trailer brake like it was in the truck bed, rather than hanging out 35 feet behind us on a 3,000 mile trip.
