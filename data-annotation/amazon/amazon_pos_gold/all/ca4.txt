Canon EOS 6D (Body Only) + Free Accessories - http://goo.gl/Anwau0

Been shooting it for four months. I love the low light capabilities. I opted for this over the 5D M3. I am satisfied. No stars off because of the position of the AF button. My hands are big and with my hand strap I am always accidentally pushing it.
