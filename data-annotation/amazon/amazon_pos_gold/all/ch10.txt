These are great. They work on any non porous surface, but I've only used them on glass so far. They're perfect for writing on the bathroom mirror and windows. The colors are vibrant, a lot brighter than I had expected. And they come with this cute holder. The ink washes off easily too. I love these markers!
I recieved these at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review.
