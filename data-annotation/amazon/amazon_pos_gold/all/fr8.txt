I received this product in exchange for an honest review, so if you ar looking for a professional review, skip to the next one....but if you're looking for an honest review from a person with crazy sensitive skin, this is the review for you. I was impressed that there was little to no odor, the feel on the skin after a bath or shower is amazing. I've also used this in my hair, which is thick and curly and insanely dry with very nice results. Wonderful product.
