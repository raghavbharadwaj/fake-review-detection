I ordered these because I got a great deal and half regretted it until I tried them out. Did I need them? No.. but they're beautiful! They glide over surfaces. I tried them out on windows and the color is bright and happy. They wipe off with a little pressure. I'm confident I'll get a lot of use out of these!
