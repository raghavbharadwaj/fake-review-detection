I use this mainly as a carrier oil for my essential oils as well as a mouthwash combined with Clove oil and water. I recently quit smoking and developed mouth ulcers. The oil/Clove combination helped clear them up and dull the pain. It's a great oil, absorbs quickly and mixes very well with my essential oils. Just a tablespoon in my bath leaves my skin moisturized all day. It's an awesome oil for the price. I received this coconut oil at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.
