I would classify myself as a premium hobbyist who has gone from a digital rebel, to a (used) 5D, to my current 6D. I'm very happy with the 6D, especially for the price, although it's certainly not perfect.

Strengths:
* Full frame, so great performance in low light, even significantly better than my 5D.
* At about half the price of the 5D Mark III, I find it a great value. I guess I'd like to have a slightly better AF system, but the upgrade wouldn't be worth it.
* Relatively lightweight.
* WiFi - at first I thought this was a gimmick, but it's nice to be able to pull a picture off the camera to post on social media without going home, dumping the card, etc.

Weaknesses:
* Video. Although it produces stunning video when used on a tripod with serious glass (any L lens will do), it just isn't as good for the hobbyist as a small dedicated camera. Autofocus while shooting is the main issue here, the viewfinder is just too small to focus by hand in real life conditions.

Since I saved a bunch of money by not buying the 5D Mark III, I'm looking forward to a quick upgrade on the 6D Mark II whenever it's announced, as I'm sure it will bump up performance in many areas and improve video autofocus as the 70D has.
