Cuisinart CPT-440 Touch to Toast Leverless 4-Slice Toaster - http://goo.gl/CSZWA5
Mr. Girt

We bought this to replace a toaster that was untrustworthy - drifting between too light and too dark. This toaster looks good and toasts consistently well. The automatic lower and raise elevator is a fun feature. Toaster has a variety of options, and yet controls are simple and well laid out. We toast everything from fresh bagels, to hand-sliced Italian bread, to frozen pumpernickel. The bagel orientation guide on top of the toaster helps avoid confusion. The digital darkness settings help you learn what works best for you. So far, we've stayed between the No. 2 and No. 4 settings. The defrost and toast combination works wonderfully for frozen slices. Bread comes out evenly toasted, and comes out the same every time even when used in rapid succession. The slot openings are 5 1/4 inches x 1 1/2 inches, which we found large enough for store-bought breads (Pepperidge Farms German Dark Wheat is 5 inches wide). For larger artisan type breads, we simply cut them in half; same as what we did with our previous toaster. Many reviews complained about the cord coming out the front of the toaster. Actually the cord comes out of the bottom - yes closer to the front than the rear - but it stays concealed underneath anyway. Some have complained about the loudness of the two beeps to tell you your toast is done - we didn't find this to be annoying. Others have complained that the coils don't get red enough. The important thing is the results - how good your toast is - not how red the coils get. No more scraping burnt toast, and no more toasting a second time (and then burning your toast) because it was too light the first time.
Pros: Consistent, Digital Controls are Reliable and Easy to Set, Looks Good, Fun, It does what you want, so less bread is wasted, Cool to the touch.
Cons: Slightly wider than our old toaster (about an inch), expensive for a toaster
