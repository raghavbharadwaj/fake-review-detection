loving this vacuum. needed something strong to pick up dog hair but I hated my Dyson--too heavy with not enough control. Everyone I surveyed said "Shark" and I chose this one that Amazon had a great price for. Very happy so far. Strong suction, with a release to handle small area rugs, lightweight feel with great easy turning.
