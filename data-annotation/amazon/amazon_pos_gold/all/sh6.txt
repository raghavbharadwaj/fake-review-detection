I wish I had bought a Shark sooner! I've wasted money on other brands and my parents had me try their Shark Professional. I. Love. Shark. I wish I had the extra money to get the professional, but I am extremely happy with my Navigator. It's smooth, it's quiet, it picks up things on the first run (I have a dog who sheds. A lot. It's also easy for my son to use, at his age he's taking on vacuuming and it's much ligher than the other vacuums I've had in the past. You don't need to spend the extra money on a Dyson, with the Shark the Dyson is just more of a status symbol now. I rather invest my money into other things and keep my Shark.
