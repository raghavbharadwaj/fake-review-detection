I purchased the Shark Navigator Deluxe to replace our old vacuum. It is a lot smaller than our old one, but works GREAT! We've only been using it for a couple of weeks so far. The suction is impressive, and it practically pulls itself along! As of now, I'm very happy with it. We will see after using it for a longer period of time.
