Cuisinart CPT-440 Touch to Toast Leverless 4-Slice Toaster - http://goo.gl/CSZWA5

This toaster is simple and swanky. Looks amazing on my counter and works great. My toast comes out perfect every time. The display is nice and very readable with the countdown bars letting you know how much time is left. This toaster does have a push button toast which is very cool. Let's face it, it's 2013 and more things should work like this. The slots are large and can accommodate even the biggest slices. Even the lowering/raising mechanism is dead silent. When your toast is finished, there are 2 beeps that let you know. The style is very sleek as well.

I have two small and insignificant gripes about this toaster. One is the bagel label permanently placed on the top of the toaster. I think it looks a little cheesy and takes away from the minimalist feel of the toaster. Second, when you receive your toaster, there is a pretty large sticker attached to the space on the front of the toaster next to the buttons. The sticker is no problem, but as you remove it, a residue or some type of stain is left on the metallic finish. This is a little unattractive and very hard to remove. The stain just doesn't wash away easy. Maybe It was just my particular unit, but still, watch out when you remove that sticker. Other than that, I could not be happier with my purchase.
