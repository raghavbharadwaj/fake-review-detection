I am impressed. This is now Canon's most affordable full-frame camera and it delivers. I have the 5DMII and the 7D (crop sensor) camera and both have their strong points. With this 6D the biggest strengths are:

a) the price for a full-frame camera can't be beat
b) image quality is right up there with Canon's more professional cameras, and it takes awesome low-light photographs.
c) the smaller built means this feels better in my smaller hands (The 5DMII is bigger and heavier)
d) it has built-in WiFI (which is defaulted to OFF) and GPS, which neither the 5DMII nor the 7D have. (This also drains the battery down fast, though, which is a big negative)
e) The motor is very quiet; quieter than the 7D and 5DMII.

There is a slight learning curve for Canonistas, though, but thoroughly reading the manual will help. Some of the control buttons in the back are in different positions than from the 5D and 7D, but this is minor.
