This toaster replaced our last one which stopped working..........i researched long and hard to find a good one and this is the one i settled on.........love the push the button and it lowers your toast button..........it also defrosts nicely and you as expected can adust your settings for the darkness of your bread..........i place it on number 2 for toast..........man i'd hate to see how dark it gets on it's highest level.......toasts evenly and looks great..........what more can you ask for!
