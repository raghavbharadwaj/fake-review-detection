I had zero need for these markers...but when I saw them available at a discount for my honest review, I grabbed them just because! Boy am I glad I got them. HOW FUN! I love that I can write on tons of things. As soon as I got the package in the mail I took them out and starting doodling. As long as you're not writing on a porous surface, they clean right up! I wrote on and cleaned these off of the mirrors, windows, my countertop, and even the fridge! The liquid flows nicely, not too much...doesn't glob up or run. The colors are very bright!
