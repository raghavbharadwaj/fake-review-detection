I absolutely love this vacuum. Using for a couple months now. Now 39 weeks pregnant keep in mind. Our carpet has never looked better, or like this. It is so much more plush and clean. I was amazed and disgusted by the amount of dirt and hair this picks up. I prefer the smaller footprint of this vacuum since it is so light. I was able to vacuum the entire house while very pregnant, which would never have happened with our older vacuum. It is very nice being able to go under tables, between furniture, without moving anything. Noise level is quiet. Most additional instruments that come with it do not attach directly to the vacuum, however this does not bother me.
