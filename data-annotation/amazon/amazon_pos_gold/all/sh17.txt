LOVE this. just like everyone else says, the dust cup was filled even right after vacuuming the carpet with our old vacuum cleaner. this one picks up what others dont! some reviewers complained that it's loud, but i dont find it to be any louder than any other vacuum ive owned, probably quieter, in fact. i dont mind the size either...other reviewers complained that the vacuum front isnt wide enough, but the slightly smaller head just makes it easier to get under chairs, end tables, and into other small-ish spots. to get a great vacuum like this for this price is a steal!
