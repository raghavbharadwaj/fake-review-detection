Amazing camera and such a reasonable price. This camera is so much better than my crop frame camera I can't believe it took me so long to get full frame. the capabilities of this camera continue to astound me the ISO especially. on my old camera I could not go past 1600 ISO without being really noisy now I can go to 12800 and still have useable images just 50 noise reduction and 50 sharpening in Lightroom and perfect for printing. Both images i uploaded were taken handheld f4 and 12800 ISO. This is to show the capabilities this camera has with noise.
