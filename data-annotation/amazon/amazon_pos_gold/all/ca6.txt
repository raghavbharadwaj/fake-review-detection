I upgraded from my Canon t3i, and I can't tell you what a huge difference this camera makes. I never understood truly what full-frame vs. crop-frame was until I dove in and bought this camera. This camera shows so much more in the frame with the subject, and gives that wonderful "foggy" background that everyone loves. Also, with my t3i, I could never understand why my pictures were always so gritty looking. I tried everything, but I always had these little dots all over my pictures, and had to edit them in lightroom for them to look remotely decent. With the Canon 6d, you can pretty much shoot at any ISO and hardly have any noise in your pictures. The pictures are so sharp, yet soft. It captures the details of everything! And the best part is that you can shoot indoors, or at night, and the pictures are super clear!
