I am in love with these colore liquid free markers for one they are very fun to use with my daughter and they are bold bright colors and easy to use. I love that they are mess free no getting chalk all over your clothes or hands and no inhaling the chalk dust which is perfect for me with my asthma.

My daughter is 11 and even at her age she makes messes and still trys to write on her walls or windows we are redoing her room then sticking some chalkboard paper on her walls so these will be perfect for her plus if she writes on windows it will wipe off.

They do however a bit of a smell as do most markers but you can't really notice unless your really sniffing it in so obviously don't be sticking up to nose and sniffing and as it says on markers don't put in your mouth so keep away from little ones.

I loved all the different colors my favorites are green, red, blue, and purple they wrote very well and nice and bold. I also loved the extra holder to keep them organized mine was neon green and is nice to set it on a desk.
