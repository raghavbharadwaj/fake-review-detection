I can actually have my EggoÂ® Waffles again!!
This toaster doe's a great job to quickly toast Eggos, without drying them out inside .
You can only accomplish this by toasting hot and quickly, this toasters has 950 watts!
I like Eggo's brown on the outside, but moist inside (a setting of 5 with the defrost button selected).
This toaster was well worth my 2 days of researching this subject.
Most toasters out there don.t even publish there wattage.
The bottom line is "more power = faster toasting".
Faster toasting = moist inside of whatever your toasting, even thin white bread.
