Radha does it once again with excellent quality with their Coconut Oil! This oil is great for many skin conditions and can be used as carrier oil as well for massage oils. I use it as a moisturizer and it works very well, with a quick drying time and no staining. At this price and amount that comes in the decently-sized bottle, you are getting a good value too :)
