When I ordered this toaster I was unsure whether it would work right. Well buy this one it is quiet and works very well I am so glad I got it. The toast comes out great, it also shows how time is left by limes in the display window they disappear as the toast is getting ready to pop up. When it pops up there is a beeper that goes off to make you aware that toast is up if you are busy doing other things. How great is that I hate cold toast! My family just loves this toaster I have bought so many toasters half of them never worked right. You won't be sorry with this one!
