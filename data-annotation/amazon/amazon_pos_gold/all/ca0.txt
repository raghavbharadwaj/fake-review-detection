Canon EOS 6D (Body Only) + Free Accessories - http://goo.gl/Anwau0

I'm a professional photographer (it just took me a long time to upgrade from my XTi) and I finally convinced my husband that it really was time for me to get a better camera. I chose this instead of the 5d because it can wireless transmit my images to my computer which will be a huge plus when I do events when people have their photos taken and view and order that night. My only concern was that the 5d has ALOT more AF sensors and more cross sensors. I decided that wireless was more important and I was willing to try the 6d out.

Well it is MUCH better then my XTi, more then what I expected it to be. The focus is dead on for the most part but at times it isn't completely sharp - I do a lot of newborns and I'm talking about seeing every little baby eyelash in perfect detail along with the little white pores on their noses. When its not perfect, its still close. I'm sure its because I don't have a AF sensor right where the eye is and so I have to move it slightly to focus on the eye and then move it back which at a 1.8 F stop can throw things off slightly. I'm thinking I wouldn't have this problem with the 5D but like I said, its just slightly and so it doesn't give me too much heartache.

The colour is great for the most part though some of my babies turn out a little magenta. I might have to do a custom white balance there but outdoor shots seem to have fabulous colours. Sturdy build. Hard to beat at this price range. Can't believe I bought my XTi 8 years ago for pretty well the same price.
