Unless you need the 3D support, I would stay away from a smart TV. I have several TV's and game consoles and can't not stand smart TV's! No matter how I adjust them and what brand I get, I can't get rid of the lag! Smart tv's are not that great, at times they hang and the apps never get updated so after a couple years, the apps like Netflix and Amazon no longer work.
So what I do is buy non-smart TV's and put a Roku box on them. I bought this one for my PS3 and the color is awesome and it works great! Very simple to use and setup. It sounds pretty good also, but I did have an extra sound bar laying around I put on it, but I don't use it that much. If you have any type of game console I would look at this TV and stay away from the smart tv's :)
