Excellent camera. I have this and a t2i, and I have to say that using this is much nicer than the t2. This has a lot more functionality, less noise at higher ISOs, better low light performance, a little faster with fps, overall feel and controls are more intuitive. I primarily got this as I wanted to have a full frame sensor for the things I mentioned; noise, low light performance etc., and to compliment the crop sensor setup of the t2. I carry both of these on my nature treks and use the t2 for long shots (wildlife) and the 6d for landscape/nature/macro. I've had this for a couple years and am very satisfied with it.
