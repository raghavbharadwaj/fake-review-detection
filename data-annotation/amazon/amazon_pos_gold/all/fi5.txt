All everyone talks about is all the kinky sex that goes on, but really.. There's so much more to this book. I read Fifty Shades Of Grey in less than two weeks. Completely and absolutely hooked from the very first chapter. It's like a television series that ends each episode with something crazy and you just have to see what's gonna happen next! Ahh love it love it !
