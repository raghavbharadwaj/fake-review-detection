Best Vacuum ever! Had old Hoover for over eight years and needed a new one! Old one was just not sucking good enough. Read the reviews and went with this Shark. WE could not be happier, had just vacuumed the whole house in the morning and this came in the afternoon. Ran it over all the carpets as a test and the thing sucked up over two inches of dust and dirt that the old one had been missing. Highly recommend this Shark!
