Justice League Unlimited: Season 1 (DC Comics Classic Collection) - http://goo.gl/0M4wa8

In my opinion, even better than the original Justice League cartoon series, and I LOVED that series. For people who want to see more minor DC characters like Green Arrow, Black Canary, Huntress, the Question, and more done brilliantly, this show is excellent. The dialogue is really well written, and some of the snappy comebacks and arguing between Black Canary and Green Lantern are hilarious. Classic superhero cartoons of the 90's at their best.
