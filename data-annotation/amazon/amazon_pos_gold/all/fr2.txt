This product is awesome quality! It is really pure and can be used for just about anything. Something about it being completely clear is more appeasing to me than the buttery solid jar I had been using. I use it for cooking and it works wonderfully. My girlfriend asked me for a bottle so she can use as a quick after-shower moisturizer for skin and hair, which works really well because it is a smooth liquid right out of the bottle. A promotional sale led me to trying this product from Radha Beauty, and in turn helped me find some of their other skincare products that look to be very promising from other reviewers. Radha Beauty has my recommendation!
