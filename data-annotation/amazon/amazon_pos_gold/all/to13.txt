Cuisinart CPT-440 Touch to Toast Leverless 4-Slice Toaster - http://goo.gl/CSZWA5

Bought this to replace a giant 4-slice Cuisinart toaster that worked great, but took up too much room on the counter top. Wanted something "pretty" because it was going to sit out and this fit the bill.

I was nervous about it being leverless, but it was cheaper than the one with the lever (weird) so I thought I would give it a whirl. I don't go all crazy with my toasting, so its been great so far.

I really like the count-down bars so I know how much longer my little toast will be toastin' for. The bagel setting is great, I had that on my old toaster and I'm not actually sure it worked... but this one does. And its fabulous. I don't like my toast or bagels too dark, so I keep it on level 3 and its perfect.

One review said there was a weird metallic smell at first - I didn't notice that, but he ran the toaster empty and on the highest level a few times to burn off that metallic-y smell so I did the same thing. It seemed to work.
