Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy - http://goo.gl/ZVdjOA
View from the hills

This book seems to ignite two schools of thought...either "I Love it" or "I Hate it" and it's mostly due to the first person writing and the sex on every page and a snarky subconscious who can't keep her mouth shut.
So put all that aside and focus on the story.....yes there is a story and it is about love and redemption. It's the story of a domineering man who through no fault of his own has an exceedingly difficult and tortured childhood. He grows into a angry teen even though he is adopted by a loving stable family. He is introduced to the discipline of a dominant and submissive sexual lifestyle by an older woman who is delusional in thinking she is doing him a favor. His dominant character translates into a brutal business man who amasses a great amount of wealth due to his brains and charm. He is master of his world and then Ana enters his life and everything he has ever known comes into question. She is different, she makes him want to experience things he never had the courage to before. She is honest and without guile. She rocks Christians world and he hers. And together they find a way to cope and heal the darkest parts of his fiftyness.
