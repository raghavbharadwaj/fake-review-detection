It came nicely packaged. I used it after I washed my daughters hair with a dab of conditioner. Really soft and shiny. I used on my hair as well, then flat ironed it the next day. We have really curly hair and it gets real dry. My hair came out shiny too without being greasy. I use on my dry hands and cuticles too. It's non greasy and doesn't have any smell to. Can't wait to cook with it.
