Justice League Unlimited: Season 1 (DC Comics Classic Collection) - http://goo.gl/0M4wa8

Ok, I'll admit it, I like good cartoons with stories that continue on. Not a fan of soap operas mind you, but good stories, sign me up! Justice League Unlimited, is just this. It's one part story, one part cartoon, one part soap opera. Who knew GL and Hawkgirl had a thing for each other? In any case, its rich story telling with layered stories and subplots. Excellent writing and a marked improvement over the start of the series. Not just for kids anymore for also for the kids who long for decent cartoons without the crazy feel of some offerings today.
