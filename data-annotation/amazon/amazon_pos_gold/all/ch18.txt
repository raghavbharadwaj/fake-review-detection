I received this product at a discount for my honest review. These chalk pens are great. I have never had anything like this before and I am so happy with them because I can do so many cool projects I have seen online. The pen holder is a great idea so I can keep them all on one place without my space being cluttered and it keeps the pins from rolling around. There is a special way to use them at first to insure maximum quality so I recommend reading that before using the product.
