LG 42LB5600 42-Inch TV (2014 Model)  - http://goo.gl/mUA1Sb

I saw the 39" version of this set at Best Buy and I fell in love with the color and clarity. I almost bought the 39" off amazon but decided to go with 32" instead. I can sit 18" away from this Tv and still have great clarity, makes a great large monitor for my laptop.The sound is nothing to complain about although eventually I will get a sound bar for this set. Has great viewing angles. Note this is a review plugging in and going with no modifications to any settings. If I could have a bigger one I would get it.
