Amazing. I bought this to accompany an Apple TV, so I didn't need a "smart TV" just one with great image quality. I went to a big box electronics retailer and compared brands and this exact TV was the one that looked the best in person. I found it on Amazon much cheaper and ordered it immediately. It is perfect. The image is clear and crisp, and the feet seem sturdy enough to feel comfortable leaving the TV on a desk without any extra support until I wall mount it. The image and sound quality are everything I could have wanted, and it arrived in less than 24 hours (although 8 hours after arrival, Amazon still says it's "preparing for shipping" so...). Perfect for my bedroom.
