Justice League Unlimited: Season 1 (DC Comics Classic Collection) - http://goo.gl/0M4wa8

Always loved the Justice League. This series shows the origins of the Justice League, the characters involved (some origins as well) and the trouble they get into. Well written, well drawn, great voices and animated. I could not ask for more. I just wish the people making the DC movies would take a clue from these fine animated collection and put that into their movies. 26 episodes on 4 discs. Just love em. Ill watch em again when the memory fades a bit. Wish the same team would produce more!
