Received this toaster a few weeks ago to replace a toaster oven, which took up way too much room on my counter top. After much debate about whether to purchase this one, or the Breville, I opted to go with this one. Since I generally only toast bagels and waffles, and all of my small appliances are Cuisinart, I opted to go with this one because the brushed silver color matched my other appliances.

I've been using it almost daily and am ecstatic. It toasts my bagels to perfection on #6 (I like mine crunchy, with crunchy peanut butter on them.....but don't forget to put the PB on when the toast is done please, or you'll really have a mess on your hands). I also discovered that it's better to use bagels that require you to slice them. While I love the convenience of having pre-sliced bagels, they're never sliced evenly. You can do a better job of that by yourself, which will give you a more evenly toasted bagel.
