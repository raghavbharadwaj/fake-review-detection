I absolutely love this Fractionated Coconut Oil. This was the first time I have ever tried this brand and I must say I do like it a lot. After doing some research I found it can be used for a lot of things. I have recently gotten into using essential oils and this oil is perfect for being used as a carrier oil. I just mixed it with what ever essential oil I am using and rub into my body. I also used alone to apply to my dry hard cracked feet. I just used a little on my hands rubbed it into my feet and apply socks then went to bed. The next morning removed socks and my feet were smoother after a few days of doing this there were big changes the dry crack and hardness went away. I also used it on my daughters frizzy dry hair. I applied a small amount and let it set in. Then shampoo and rinse and her hair was softer and not dry. This oil will be a big help around our house.
I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for a review. Regardless all options are 100% my own based on experiences with said product
