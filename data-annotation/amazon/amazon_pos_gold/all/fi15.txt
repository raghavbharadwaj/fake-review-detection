Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy - http://goo.gl/ZVdjOA
T. Richard Clark "Dick"

The series of these three books is not about sex or BDSM as most have offered. This is an incredibly romantic story well presented in three volumes. Romance novels have a basis of conflict and harmony. This basis or palate on which the author spins his story can be religion, culture, age, education, location and a myriad of other foundations. In this story, the basis is sex--quite descriptive at times. I feel that the graphic nature may divert one's attention from the real story which is unfortunate because this is a fine love story.
