Tekonsha 90195 P3 Electronic Brake Control - http://goo.gl/JX0qfx

We started with our first smaller camper with a time based controller. It worked okay, but as we increased size of campers the old brake controller was not working. We either got too much brake when we braked at slow speeds or not enough brake while travel along the highway. This new P3 controller works great at any speed. Braking is so smooth at slow speeds. My truck and camper are now working together. It even help me at high speed as I was able to turn up the controller without getting over brake control at slow speed. This was one up grade I should have made a long time ago. Both my wife and I love it.
