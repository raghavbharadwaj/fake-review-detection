A real excellent replacement for my Samsung 42 inch that went out to early & I will never purchase another Samsung TV, but this LG TV is excellent. It was shipped to my house by way of my prime account using the prime 2 day shipping & the box that it was in was in excellent condition. The TV came out of the box new of course & packaged very well & looking & smelling new.
Really light as in weight, so very easy to lift. Really easy to install the legs on bottom of TV just two Philips screws in each legs & your done. It was really easy to hookup & set-up, It auto detected my 16 port hdmi switcher box with 2 outputs 1 to my hd projector & one to this lg 39 inch. It has the best settings that I have ever saw on a TV & the menu is very easy to navigate, It even has a advanced control with (skin color, grass color, sky color) & those options work excellent. My old Samsung TV did not have even half of the settings that is on this new lg TV. The picture on this TV is extremely clear & excellent & you can't get better especially in this prize range. This TV simply cannot be beat in this price range. My old Samsung lcd flat screen TV use to get really hot & it felt like I had a space heater on in my bedroom, but this new LG LED TV barely even gets warm & it does not warm up my room which is a plus in my eyes. So I just love this new LG TV. it is so sleek & modern looking. The two legs are very sturdy & stable & it barely has a frame around it & that was just what I was looking for, so the screen is mostly screen how it was meant to be. The picture is very clear, crisp & bright with great vibrant colors & HD wonderful. HD video looks so good on this screen. Connected to my Mac mini running XBMC &network connected to my Netgear Nas Drive with 12TB of movies & TV show goodness & streaming apps this LG TV screen handles everything excellently. I have 4 set-top boxes hooked up which are all connected by way of my rack mounted 16 port hdmi switcher, so I'm only using one hdmi port on the LG TV, so it works out fine for me because the TV has two but I only need one because I'm using the my switcher. AS far as the settings I tweaked them a little to suit what I wanted, but it was really easy to do & I would defenitely purchase another one of these LG TV's or just LG products from now on because this LG TV is well made & I could not ask for more especially in this price range. This TV is the best in it's class & price range. So people you can't do better. Go & purchase yours before there all gone people. Above was all my pro's for this LG TV & as far as Con's: there aren't any what so ever. A really awesome TV that Samsung could learn from.
