Shark Navigator Deluxe (NV42) - http://goo.gl/eq9e3P
Cherie

I have always owned the other very expensive brand ( that doesn't lose suction) vacuums. I was looking for a small inexpensive (inexpensive, being the key word here) to keep by my cats litter box, so when he started Flinging the litter everywhere, it would be an quick & easy clean up. Well, let me tell you, this little vacuum BLEW ME AWAY! Not only does this vacuum have the power to do the cat litter job, it picked up cat hair off my sons carpeted floor, after I had gone over it with my "other Vacuum" to no avail. This is, the best value for the money, and I am going to be ordering the larger size shark for the 1st 2 floors of my home. I would highly recommend this product! It is amazing!
