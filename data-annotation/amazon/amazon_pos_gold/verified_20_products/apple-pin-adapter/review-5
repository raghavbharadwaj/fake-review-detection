Well it works with my newly acquired iPhone 6. I use this adapter in conjunction with my PIE auxilary input adapter that's plugged into the factory radio in my car. It works like a charm. It charges and sends the audio signals to my radio like a BAUCE. Well worth the money so far. If something happens to it later on. I'll be sure to let yall know about it it fails.
