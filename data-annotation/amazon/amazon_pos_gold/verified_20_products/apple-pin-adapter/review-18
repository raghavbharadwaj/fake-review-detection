Now, I'll admit that I was really, REALLY avoiding paying for this adapter, but I'm so glad that I sucked it up and did it. I went through a series of cheaper options, and was disappointed each and every time since none of them worked. However, once I got this product, I could immediately notice the difference in quality, and it worked perfectly. Save yourself the trouble and heartache. Just buy the real thing. Good luck, guys!
