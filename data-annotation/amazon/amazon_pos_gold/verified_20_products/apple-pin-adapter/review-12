I needed this adapter so my iPhone5 could communicate with the 30-pin FOB required to open a Supra lockbox with an iPhone. Many of my co-workers have had problems with adapters, so I was concerned. That is why I bought the Apple Adapter and am glad I did. It has been very dependable which is exactly what you need when you want to enter a house for a showing.
