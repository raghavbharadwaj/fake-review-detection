I have the Diana camera with the instant back and bought a ton of this film. Yes it's a little spendy but when my friends had a goodbye party moving across the country, nothing made a better gift than 20 small instant photos of their friends at their last party. Sure you could take a bunch of pictures on your digital but this was a conversation starter and I did take a bunch of pictures on the digital and none of them came out as fun. Very good quality, quick mailing, good service!
