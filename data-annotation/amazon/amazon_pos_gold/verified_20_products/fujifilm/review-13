This film fits the Instax Mini 8 camera and is easy to use. One film pack holds 10 photos. Since the film is pretty expensive, I bought in bulk for a better deal. Everyone is in awe when they see the photos pop out of the camera and it is always fun waiting for the image to finally appear. Voila! Like magic! It is wonderful having actual photos of friends and family pinned up that I can look at any time.
