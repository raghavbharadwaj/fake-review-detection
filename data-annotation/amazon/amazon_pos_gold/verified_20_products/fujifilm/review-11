Everything came exactly as I wanted and it was very fast shipping. I am very happy with this company. The only thing was that my film box was the same fujifilm instax mini, except the picture wasn't of a girl, but instead two girls (must be an updated version). However I still got my 20 film pieces and it fits into my instax mini 8 film camera, so i'm happy :)
