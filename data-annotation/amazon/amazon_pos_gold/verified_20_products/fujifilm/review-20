I purchased my first Instax camera a little over a month ago. I got the Instax 50s camera for a trip and this is the film for it. It takes a bit of figuring out your preferred settings on the camera, but as far as the film is concerned... it is fantastic! Great vintage look. Great color! I am really in love with everything about this product! I thought the size might be a little on the small side, but I find that I really love the size. I purchase cheap card holder books here on amazon to put them in and they fit perfectly! EVERYONE loves these! Become an instant artist, and fall in love with these little pictures!
