The instant I hooked up the Notepad X-Slam Cool Master, the air from the fan is keeping my Laptop was heating up like a Oven. I can easily feel the Laptop and notice the difference between the temperature and performance of my Laptop since today. It's only 20 bucks, what do you have to lose? I've had my Laptop for 4 years and this Cool Master just gave my Laptop a second chance of life, and it's like a quiet mouse now. Pick up the Cool Master and you won't regret the decision.
