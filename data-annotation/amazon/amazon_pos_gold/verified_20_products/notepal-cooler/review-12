For those who are concerned about their gaming system in tight places with little ventilation and the system heats up, I use this for my Playstation 3 system. Sits right under it and plugs right into the USB port. BUT WAIT. You think it'll take up a spot in the port? WRONG. On the back of the plug is an extra USB port so you can plug this in then your PS3 charger USB cable. SOUND? Well honestly it is silent but with a big PS3 Slim on it, you can hear it slightly. Overall I would buy it still it's the perfect size.
