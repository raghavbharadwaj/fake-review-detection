It works and looks really cool, no pun intended. Not a gamer, but now and again I'll have a laptop that will start running hot. Sometimes it needs to be cleaned out, other times there's a bigger problem. Either way, having something like this around can really be valuable whether I'm going to eventually fix it permanently or not. The ability to set variable speeds is nice, and the fact that it runs off USB and doesn't require its own transformer.
