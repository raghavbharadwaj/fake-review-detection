I purchased one and then purchased another for my niece and I just bought a third one for back up , just in case. I absolutely love them. Quiet, slim, no problems at all. First one purchased in March 2014, next one in Nov 2014, the third one just today. I go through keyboards faster than fans. Maybe Cool Master needs to design keyboards...LOL
