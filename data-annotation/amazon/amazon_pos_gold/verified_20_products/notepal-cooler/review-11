This is why i shop Amazpn. I read the other reviews before i bought this and decided to give it a go. I had bought an old used Acer standard laptop for 25 bucks on Craigslist. It was turning off and slowing down due to the heat emanating off of it constantly. This fixed it immediately and I havent had a problem since.
