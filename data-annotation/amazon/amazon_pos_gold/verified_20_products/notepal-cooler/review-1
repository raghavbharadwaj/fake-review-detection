I have a rather large laptop and for the past months I've had this it has worked quite well. Previously I had some tiny external fan which would constantly struggle and become jammed for whatever reason but this one has none of those issues. The fan is large enough and there is enough protection around it to prevent any dust from really interfering with its functionality. The blue light is neat but honestly I can barely see it even in the dark since it is placed under with the fan none the less it is a nice touch. If you can afford this fan I think it is worth it considering it should last pretty long.
