After reading some of the revues about this product, I was a little worried about how loud the noise from the fan would be. Not to worry, this is the quietest cooler that I have ever owned. Thankfully, as I'm going to be laid up in the hospital for a couple of weeks and the last thing I would need is a loud laptop cooler. It's easy to connect, works great with Windows 8.1 no extra drivers needed for it. It fits perfectly in the "AmazonBasics 15.6-inch laptop bag". Well worth the money.
