It says "made in Thailand" and does not look identical to the original battery my HP laptop came with. It does work as expected, however. Performance is roughly the same as the original battery when it was new. It's been working fine for a month now. Much less expensive compared to the other MU06 battery on Amazon. I'll update this if I encounter anything unexpected or troubling.
