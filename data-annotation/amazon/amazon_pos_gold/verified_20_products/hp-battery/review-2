I have an HP G72 laptop that started complaining about its battery. This unit appears to be original HP equipment. The original battery had "Replace with HP spare 593553-001." This unit was described as being a replacement even though it is a 593554-001.This battery fit perfectly. It appears to hold a charge as well as the original. If performance holds up, this is an excellent value for the price.
