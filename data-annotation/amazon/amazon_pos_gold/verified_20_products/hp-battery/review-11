This battery ($29) is much less expensive than the price quoted to me at a large electronics store for a replacement battery ($79) for my HP Laptop. I've had this replacement battery in my HP Laptop for about a year now and have had no issues. My Laptop is not my main work computer however, it is mainly used for leisure so I cannot say for those that extensively use their Laptop that it will work as well as the original. However, I have no complaints and would certainly purchase again if needed in a few years.
