I'm using this for my HP laptop, I took someone's advice and put in the battery, I had about 40% charge, I waited until the battery drained out all the way in order to get it fully charged the first time. Well it took nearly 2 days for it to completely shut down, I didn't really use the laptop but goodness it took two days for it to actually shut off by itself LOL! I feel like this is a good buy, thanks! Also it has been working great as far as keeping charge, staying on, it's doing it's job!
