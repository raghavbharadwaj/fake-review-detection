So far I love this battery! I was skeptical before I purchased it, but I'm glad that I did. My battery was manufactured on 02/14 and it works great. I'm super happy that I no longer have to be glued to an outlet! The battery life so far is just about what my original battery life was (about 2.5 hours) so I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. It's only been about a week so I will update my review if anything changes.
