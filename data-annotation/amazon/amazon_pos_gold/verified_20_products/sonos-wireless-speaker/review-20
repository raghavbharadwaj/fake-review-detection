These things are ridiculous, really big sound in a small package. We use this in our office and it can send high quality sound through the whole complex. I cant use it at home because of the dependence on WiFi, if you have weak or slow signal or spotty coverage the speakers will disappoint.If your signal is strong and your internet has high bandwidth, there is almost nothing better for the money.
