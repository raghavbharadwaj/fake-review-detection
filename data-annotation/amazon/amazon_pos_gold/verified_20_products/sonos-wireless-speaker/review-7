This is phenomenal, and easily worth the $448 I spent. The sound is exquisite, and it's mind-boggling to think of how much music is at one's fingertips. Just this morning I listened to Nick Drake, Jeri Southern, Brook Benton, and Mel Torme; they all sounded great. To anybody who has reservations about buying this, please take my word: you won't regret it. I can only vouch for the Sonos 5--haven't heard the 1 or 3.
