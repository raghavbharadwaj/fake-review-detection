These speakers have fantastic sound for their size/price and very easy to use - with no speaker wire! I bought two in time for a dinner party, one upstairs and another down. Easy to set up, great music options, fantastic sound, all synchronized and controllable from my phone! It is refreshing to get a quality product that works as advertised for a reasonable spend.
