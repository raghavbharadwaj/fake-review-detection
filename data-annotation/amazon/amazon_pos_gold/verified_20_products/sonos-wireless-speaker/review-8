This is my third Sonos Play 1 this year (master bedroom, master bath and office). Also have a Play 5 for the main and larger room. Awesome sound and great versatility offered by Sonos. I use the sleep timer every night too. I am planning to order another Play 5 for the kitchen area to pair with the other come January (have to have two of the same speaker to pair). Great sound at a great price. Piece of cake to set up - two minutes or less - intuitive for the end user. What is really nice is the fact that if you move, Sonos moves with you. Can't beat that.
