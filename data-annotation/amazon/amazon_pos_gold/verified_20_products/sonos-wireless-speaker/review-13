The reviews are correct. Incredibly easy setup, great streaming quality on our existing router with 0 skips or delays or buffers. Really good sound quality. Only thing I wish was that it would work with Spotify without Spotify forcing me into a subscription. But doesn't really matter as Pandora rocks and we can use our own purchased music library. Highly recommend the Sonos system.
