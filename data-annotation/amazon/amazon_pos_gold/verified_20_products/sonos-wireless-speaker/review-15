We are a Sonos family for sure---and we purchased two of these SONOS PLAY:1s to combine with the Sonos sound bar to have a surround sound experience when we watch TV. Works great--we placed them on each side of us just behind the sofa. Very pleased. Excellent quality. Sonos has never disappointed us yet! We will continue to purchase their products.
