I did a lot of research on something that would play music wireless controlled by android phones and tablets. I was thinking about a Bluetooth radio, but ran across this device. I also bought the bridge so I could set this up in a remote location. (Sun room). Easy to set up. Just plugged them in, ran the software to add music and boom! There it was! It sounds amazing! A little on the pricey side but for the sound quality and great control apps, it is worth it! Now, for the only con which is minor to me. You can't play music to the system directly from your phone or tablet (music stored on phone or tablet) unless you plug cable from phone to back of system. But here is my solution. I have a drop box account on my phone, tablet, and computer. Then I have the drop box file with music in my sonos library. So I can take a song from phone or tablet and share it to drop box folder then refresh sonos library, and it will then play on sonos! Great system!
