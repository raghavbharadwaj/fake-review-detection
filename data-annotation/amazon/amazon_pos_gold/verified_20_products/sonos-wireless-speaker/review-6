I suppose I'm an idiot for thinking the speaker itself was wireless, so if anyone else is as ignorant as myself you now know the speaker must be plugged in to use. Once you download the app for your device, and plug in the speaker, your listening to music within seconds. Considering the small size of this speaker, the sound of the music is exceptional. Make it loud enough and you feel like you're in a recording studio.
