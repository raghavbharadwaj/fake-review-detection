I just received wireless controller and S5 today. Not paying attention to dimension specs I was little surprised by smaller then expected size. However in some cases size does not matter and this is the one that it is true. Sound quality is very good for portable device that can be easily moved to your deck or other room. Moving S5 is as simple as removing power cord and reconnecting it in new location. Setup of Pandora, last.fm and mp3 library was very intuitive (for initial setup use your computer, which makes this much easier). I use iphone with Sonos app that again is very easy to use and has all needed options to control the system. The good news is that you control Sonos with many devices including computer, iphone, etc. When I was buying it I was not sure if that is the case. With service like Pandora, last.fm you basically can stop buying music and discover new artists that you did not know. Another compatible great service is radiotime that works like a charm. Since it is not possible to see device locally I was little skeptic that it may not deliver what it promises and price doesn't belong to lowest. To my surprise I am very happy with it and will definitely keep it. I will probably get one or two more of these in near future (if you are planning one, be warned that you will want more).
