This speaker is pure awesomeness! The bass and sound from it is so good and I didn't think it can get loud, boy was I wrong. This thing operates solely on wifi connection so if you don't have wifi this is useless for you. It takes less than 3 minutes to set it up and after the set up you can select from a wide selection of radios or apps to stream music from. Overall pretty good buy from sonos.
