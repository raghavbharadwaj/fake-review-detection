We bought the S5 after reading some of the breathless reviews. The concept of high quality, easily mobile wireless audio technology has always been appealing, but it didn't ever quite seem ripe. Well, it is now.Setting up the S5 (if you don't have other Sonos equipment already, you're going to need the $99 Sound Bridge unless you only want to connect the S5 to your wired router . . . but why would you do that???) is about as easy as it gets. You tell it where your music is it indexes it, and it's all there, anywhere in your house, any time you want. The integration with Pandora, last.fm, and other internet radio is exceptional -- you would almost think they were proprietary services of Sonos, it's so well done.You do not need to be a computer geek or a technician to install or appreciate this device. I am the geek in our house; my wife could care less about technology. About the best recommendation I can make in this regard is this: my wife does not have the technical interest or desire to even attempt to use Pandora and last.fm in their traditional, computer-based formats. She was setting up stations and using all of them flawlessly and joyfully within hours of the S5 arriving at our home.If you have an iPhone and have any interest in this product, you won't be sorry.
