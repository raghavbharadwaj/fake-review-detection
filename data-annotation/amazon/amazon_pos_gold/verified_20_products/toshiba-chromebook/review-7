The screen images are crisp and it does everything I need at a bargain price. It obviously not an Apple laptop but I don't need or want one of those. You are limited with the cloud based system but if your needs do not exdeed your limits then it really doesn't matter. This machine is plenty fast and very convenient. Battery life seems more than adequate.
