I really liked this Chromebook. It is perfect for what I use a laptop for. I may have to downgrade this rating though depending just how well Toshiba stands behind their product. The other day I came home from work, opened up the Chromebook and when the video started the screen was all dark with red, pink and green lines running through it. It never did come on and the screen got very hot in the center at the bottom. I've only had this thing for 3 months and it's never been abused and is still in "like new" condition. Initial calls to Toshiba did not sound promising. After I explained the issue I was having the very first thing out of the representatives mouth was "Well, that probably won't be covered by your warranty!" They stopped short of dashing my hopes completely but I certainly do not have a warm, fuzzy feeling at this point. So right now I am torn between a great little Chromebook that could turn into a bad memory.
