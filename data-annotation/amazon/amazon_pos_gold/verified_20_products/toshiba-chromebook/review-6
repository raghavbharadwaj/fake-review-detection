iI wasnt sure how I was going to feel about ChromeOS, being web based and not having traditional applications.. but after using it for a bit, now I am completely satisfied with the purchase. I am a pro photographer, so I was unsure if this would meet my needs, but it is able to handle 98% of what I need a laptop to do (obviously my editing will always be desktop based). Super light, perfect size, beautiful screen, great style.. perfect for client meetings or dumping cards while on a shoot (sd reader and usb3 help in that regard). It boots in seconds, literally takes more time to type my password than start up. Awesome little machine, and for $300, its a no brainer, esp if you are already utilizing google products. Honestly, I like it quite a bit more than my previous macbook pro for my laptop needs.
