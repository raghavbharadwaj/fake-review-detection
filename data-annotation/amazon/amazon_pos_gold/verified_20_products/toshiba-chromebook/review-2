I like many other people searched until my fingers flew off researching the Chromebook field. A little background. I initially had two Chromebooks (11.6 Samsung and 14 HP) just after they were released and at that time I really enjoyed them but felt that I probably needed something bigger. I invested in a 13" Macbook Pro and am very happy with it however... like most average consumers I do 90% or more of my computing using a browser. The other 10% is done on my Macbook Pro and really that's only to edit photos (and I can do that just as well with a browser based app). I now store my photos on a personal external HDD and up in the cloud, this makes sharing so much easier. My new Samsung 2 arrived. Un-boxed and plugged in for 30 minutes and battery was full charge. Opened it up and WOW! This display is awesome. Very bright and colorful. This HD IPS display is really something else. My previous ones were the normal dull low resolution models which were fine but this one stands out. Yes it looks like my Macbook Pro and you know I think it manages the web faster! The keyboard is solid and very easy to get used to The track pad is find but has a bit of a rough surface (it's not glass) but responds just fine. This Chromebook looks great, is light weight, quite solid for being a plastic body, the sound is above average and the web camera can take a decent photo. For a 13" Chromebook this one rocks. It looks and feels even better then my Mac. I'm very happy and excited to be back in the Chromebook seat again. I'll keep the Macbook because it has an optical drive so I can copy our old VHSc tapes to disc. By the way, I've been on this all evening and the battery is still at 86%. I'm glad to be back with a Chromebook and I'm very happy with this Toshiba!
