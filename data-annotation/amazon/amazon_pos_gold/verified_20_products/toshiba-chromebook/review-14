Purchased this bc I did not want to deal with windows...broken windows. I am an Apple fan, own an iPhone 6 previously had 5 and recently sold a Mac Mini(purchased on Amazon) sold for a good price, I wanted a Macbook but common sense told me not to spend the $1400 for it. Having almost completely given up the notion to buy a computer and keep using my phone to search the web-I saw something about Google Chrome and felt compelled to research it. Turned out, it was rated highly(top 10) so, I decided to buy...and I love it!!! No, it does not have all the bells and whistles of the MB-BUT FOR THE PRICE, IT'S WAY BETTER THAN ANYTHING WITH WINDOWS OS!!!! There are plenty of links on Google to make it your own and it does not break your budget! Give it a try if you are open to something different, I don't think you will regret it!
