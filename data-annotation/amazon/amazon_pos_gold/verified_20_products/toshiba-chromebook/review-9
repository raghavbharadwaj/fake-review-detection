I run a business and do most of my work in browsers so I thought I'd try a chromebook. I also run a podcast. I've had it for about 5 days and I have to say I love it. I've recorded a couple podcast episodes already and it went well. It's super fast. I always have many tabs open to do online marketing so I didn't want it to get slowed down. The battery lasts all day. The keyboard feels good too. The screen quality is awesome and there is a noticable difference with the speakers. I love it!
