I've had an older chromebook that has been dropped at least 4 times. There are things rattling inside but it still works. The mouse-pad is a bit touchy and really only works well with a mouse now. This is why I bought a new one. I converted from Mac about 2 years ago and have never looked back. This new chromebook is very light, has absolutely everything I need, speakers are fantastic, it's very light and easy to slip into my enormous purse. Plus, the screen is off the hook. The newest updates with design and such are great. I'd be surprised if I ever go back to a traditional laptop.
