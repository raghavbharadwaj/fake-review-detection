After some research, I chose the HERO3 vs. newer versions, just because I won't use it as often to necessitate the price difference. In particular, wanted to use for scuba diving and it worked out just as intended with great picture quality. Was worried about underwater case leaking but didn't encounter any issues despite multiple uses over consecutive days (definitely recommend cleaning it thoroughly after each use to prevent corrosion or debris from breaking seal. These weren't actually problems for me, but still recommend, per manufacturer recommendations). Manual scrolling to device options via buttons is a bit laborious but it is manageable. Appreciate the range of photo options, as well as video setting. Great to have the GoPro app for fairly easy review after filming; if I understand correctly, there is the LCD screen accessory that could be purchased to do this, but I haven't tried it yet. Nice to be able to charge camera while still viewing video via app. It has a great lightweight, compact design, making it easy to travel with and store. Overall, terrific camera!
