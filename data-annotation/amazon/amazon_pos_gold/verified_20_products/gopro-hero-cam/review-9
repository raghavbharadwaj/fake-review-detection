The wide angle lens and high-def, high fps framerate make this a great camera, especially for it's size. Throw in the underwater housing, and (FREE) remote control app (iOS & Android) and this thing is awesome!! I'm taking mine snowboarding in a week, hoping to look like the pros, will be happy to look like a high-def amateur.. XD
