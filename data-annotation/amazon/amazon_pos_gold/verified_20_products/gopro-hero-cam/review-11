The Hero3 is an excellent choice in value between the other options available today. The video quality this camera records is superb. The newer models do have better options for frame rate and even 4K video but the average user honestly doesn't need all these options. This model has the ability to transmit to the GoPro cellphone app directly from the camera via a secure Wi-Fi connection. I found this option to be incredibly useful when capturing and checking video's while away from a computer. This feature is a necessity. The biggest gripe i have about the camera is the poor battery life. Purchasing an extra battery and/or the battery backpack is a must.
