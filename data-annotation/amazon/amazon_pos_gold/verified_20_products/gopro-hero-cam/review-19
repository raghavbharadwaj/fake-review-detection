i take it everywhere i go, films great. i normally do 1080p which films at 29.97 fps or so. which isn't THAT bad but you do notice the lag when you switch it to 720p at 60 frames lol. dramatic difference but i like the better quality of 1080p, perfect for what i do within budget. bought the gopro frame for it which was a huge difference in sound quality and size. still sturdy enough to drop a few times and take a shock or two. definately would recommend it to those vloggers out there like me who use it outside alot and would hate to have the sound go to crap because of the housing it comes with! thanks gopro for a quality product.there are a few cons about the battery freezing up that i saw people complain about. yes it does do it rarely but all you gotta do is just undo the battery from the back and plop it back in and it starts back up. i leave my wifi off because it drains the battery SO Bad. extremely fast. and without a battery pack of some sort to keep it charged while filming. it will die within an hour of continuous filming.
