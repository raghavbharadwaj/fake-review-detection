I bought these for my students to make documentaries. They are hardy, easy to use, and very kid-friendly. Like any new "toy" the fun is with exploring and learning how it works…this was a fun and exciting process for me and my students. Battery life is more than adequate…especially combined with a back-up battery and charger. Using the GoPro Studio software, the class is making some pretty cool documentaries. There are other cams available for such projects, but I wanted a cam that could handle extensive kid use, and was easy to use…the GoPro works!
