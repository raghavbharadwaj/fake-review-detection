It's actually better than I expected. The camera is very "forgiving" of light and distance changes. I really didn't expect the focus to be as good as it is since it's a fixed focus camera. If you get one, go ahead and get a few accessories, like suction cup mount and either a handle bar mount or roll bar mount. My only complaint is that they didn't have these when I was a lot younger!
