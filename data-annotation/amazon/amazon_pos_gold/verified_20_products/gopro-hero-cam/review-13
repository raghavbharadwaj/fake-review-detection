Works fine . Was uncertain about the 5MP but looks much better than I expected. I love being able to control it with the I-Phone app and also seeing the Picture real time makes it easier to aim. The +/- 4 second delay is a bit distractive but still useful. Bought a EEEkit to take it Zip lining, Caving and Snorkling in Costa Rica on our Honeymoon. That gave us all the different mounts we needed and some for the motorcycle as well.
