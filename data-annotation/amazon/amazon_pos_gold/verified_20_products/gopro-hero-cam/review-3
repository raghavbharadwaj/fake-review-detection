We bought the GoPro Hero 3 White edition for snorkeling in Hawaii. It's not our primary camera, so we didn't want the upgraded editions. We used it for both video and still shooting, and the pictures and video were great - very clear and bright. We were impressed with the f2 lens, which let a lot of light in - some cameras with smaller apertures give a much darker image underwater. The waterproof housing kept everything dry. We were also impressed with the battery life. The menus take a little getting used to, but that's true with any camera we've owned. Note that the camera does not have a screen for seeing what you're shooting, nor for viewing images afterwards - you just have to trust that you're shooting in the right direction, but the wide-angle lens helps a lot. We used this with a Sannysis floating handle, so that the camera would float if we let go of it - definitely a good idea for water use. We definitely recommend this camera!
