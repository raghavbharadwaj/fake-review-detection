Take the waterproof case off and it's a great camera for vlogging. I use it daily. its so tiny with such power, the quality is amazing, I don't feel like im sacrificing quality for a small camera.it doesnt have a screen but as a vlogger I mainly have the camera turned at me anyway and cant see a screen. and as for when I turn it away from me and have to record something else I think just years of holding a camera lets me know what I'm pointing at.my complaint is that it beeps so much! turning it on, 3 beeps, turning it off 9 beeps! so many beeps!
