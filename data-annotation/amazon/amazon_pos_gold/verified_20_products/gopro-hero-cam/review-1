iI have a buddy who has an older Hero2 and the latest Hero3+ Black Edition. After talking to him and looking at a bunch of his videos from each, I decided on the Hero3 White Edition based on what features I wanted. To me there was no question about the quality or reliability, these things are great for years. I wanted the ability to get HD 1080p vids at 30fps, but didn't have a reason to get the 60fps or the higher-res formats available in the Hero3+ Black. Those really are great features if you need them, the video quality is amazing, but wasn't necessary for me personally. One thing I learned about the White edition that i got is it has the ability to link to my iPhone (and other phones I'm sure but check the specs) and review videos or watch a live feed from the camera with only a few second delay, via a wifi connection using the GoPro app. I can also use the phone as a remote control for starting and stopping recording too, which for me makes having a separate remote unnecessary. Mine came with both the watertight enclosure and the skeleton back if you want clearer sound and don't need the protection. I wish GoPro included a little bit of memory with the package, you can't record without it. Separately I bought a 32GB Ultra Micro SDHC card, gives me more recording capacity than I need, many hours.
