I usually never write reviews but I had to this time. This camera works amazing and I don't regret purchasing this. It worked perfectly up until it had sound issues so I called GoPro and they had horrible customer service and wouldnt do anything for me. So I called amazon because i didn't know what else to do and Amazons customer service is THE BEST. The sent me a brand new one next day even though it was two months old and not in the 30 day period. They give you a shipping label and all you have to do is send it back within 30 days. Anyway this go pro has amazing quality and with numerous mounts this is the way to go to record any action sport you may do.
