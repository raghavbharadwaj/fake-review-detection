I love my GoPro! Its so versatile with all the different mounts and tripod applications and can be controlled by my phone which doubles as a viewfinder! If you don't plan on using it in extreme situations, definitely get a frame case for it because the audio quality with the waterproof case is terrible. You'll be thanking me later when you compare videos with and without the waterproof case.
