This camera is awesome! I was able to get some really cool pictures and videos on my trip to Hawaii. I would post the pictures up on Facebook and everyone would comment on how nice the pictures were. I only had a problem when it would not turn on for some reason, and 1 time throughout the week i used it it froze and wouldn't turn off but i just took the battery out and put it back in. The fish eye effect makes the pictures different. It was worth buying it! My iPhone 5s would not take pictures or film videos the way this did!
