I was very pleased with the gopro. A 32gb sd card definitely holds enough footage for any day of action, up to 4.5 hours in 1080p. The waterproof casing held strong under 30-40 feet of water and takes better still pictures than most smartphones. I would recommend watching a video on how to clean the casing, as an improper cleaning can cause condensation and blurring of videos and pictures. Overall, it is a great product.
