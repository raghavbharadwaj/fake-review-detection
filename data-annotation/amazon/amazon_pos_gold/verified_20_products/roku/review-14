I owned a Roku 2 for a while and appreciated the intuitive interface and straightforward setup. I bought the Roku 3 for my parents and was very satisfied with the new hardware and remote. Everything runs much faster and the on screen menu system is as easy to use as ever. This is a great product for people who don't always feel comfortable with the latest technology.
