Love it! Changed my life! This is so far superior to cable, and so much cheaper, I'm amazed that there are still cords left to be cut. When I go visit my brother with cable, I'm always struck at how much I hate the experience of watching cable compared to Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, and few other channels on my Roku
