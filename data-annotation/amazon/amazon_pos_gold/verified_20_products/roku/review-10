Excellent! High Definition. Terrible shame that depends on Comcast internet service (in my case). I like that you can add extra channels and you can watch Amazon Prime, hulu, netfix and some free channels. I recommend it 100%. It's a great savings compared to Xfinity TV ($ 165 monthly 2tv + HD). With Roku savings is about $ 1,700 per year. I love the shortcut buttons on the control and the headphones.
