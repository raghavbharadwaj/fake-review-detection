I'm a stay at home mother and if the tv is on during the day its almost always cartoons. By the time my husband would home and my LO was in bed I didn't get a chance to relax and watch what I wanted to watch on tv. I mainly just watch tv shows so decided to buy this instead of installing another att box that wouldn't get used a whole lot. I LOVE MY ROKU!!!! I get to watch WHAT I want WHEN I want and can even fast-forward or rewind which I cant do with a tv provider.
