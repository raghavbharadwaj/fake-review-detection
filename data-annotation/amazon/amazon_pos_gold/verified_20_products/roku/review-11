This is my 4th Roku and 2nd Roku 3. They all perform well as long as you have a fairly fast router and WiFi connection, however the 3s seem to require more coverage on WiFi. The 3 is very fast and has loads of content to choose from which is available on all models. If you are looking to do a "cord cutting" Roku is a great choice.
