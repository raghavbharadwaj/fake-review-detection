I was very excited about this phone to begin with, but wow. I use Amazon for everything so having it all on one device is awesome.I only have issues with getting used to the operating system, however that's just my fault. I love the ease and simplicity this phone has to offer. I only wish the Appstore had some of my favorite games without having to pay an arm and leg. But again that has nothing to with the phone. If your looking for a great phone with great design and feel then then look no further.
