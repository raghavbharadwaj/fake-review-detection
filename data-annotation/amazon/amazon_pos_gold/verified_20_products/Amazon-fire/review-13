This new fork of the 2014 Android KitKat OS is a major improvement over the 2012 version of android (4.1) previously installed on the Fire phone. If you are hesitating to buy one due to it having such an old version of android installed, the new update is available for manual install (check XDA forums) or wait a few days for the OTA update to be released here in the States.
