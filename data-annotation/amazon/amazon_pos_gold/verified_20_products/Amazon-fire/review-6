I don't understand all of the negative reviews about this phone. I love it. I own an iphone 5 and a samsung galaxy phone. The fire phone is my go to phone. Yes, I side loaded some of the apps that were not available in the amazon app store but so what. The phone runs flawlessly and it is quick. I would buy it again
