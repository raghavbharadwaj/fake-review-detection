I just love this phone. I loved it so much I bought one for My husband. I am not a geek and yet the phone has been easy to use. I have not missed Google at all! Every application made for this phone has worked great. I think that this phone is the best on the market right now. It has the best of both worlds. I had a iPhone, and my hubby had a Android OS. Since I was.used to iPhone I thought this phone would be hard to use. It has been great to use and understand. My husband has not had a hard time with this phone either. customer service is wonderful also.
