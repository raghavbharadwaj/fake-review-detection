This phone I'm sure has made many wish they did not buy it, but like all devices it takes a bit of learning to get used too, I like it so far, was very easy to setup, called T-Mobile and they were able to activated onto my account without a hassle just had to go and get the sim card from T-Mobile Store, and Walla it was running, As mentioned earlier just need to learn how all functions work but the most important one is knowing how to make phone calls the rest will come with time, other than that it has so far been a great item
