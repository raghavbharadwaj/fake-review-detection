I had been looking for a new phone since I was very unhappy with my Nokia, I had always liked Samsung but they were priced to high so I checked into the fire phone again and the reviews were much better than when it first came out, and I am a fan of the kindle, and the price was right for the unlocked version along with a year of prime. I wasn`t sure what I would think but it had to be better than what I had, I liked alright right away but as I got used to it I started really liking how it worked and really started to wonder why it had the bad reviews, but I understand it just happens to work great on everything I want in a phone, I`ve had it for about two months now and it`s by far the best phone I`ve ever used, and its got plenty of storage, and had played every format of video I put on it, and at this point it`s hard to find anything bad about it, the battery could last longer but that`s not a big problem. It will take a little time to get used to it, but once you do its easier and more handy to use than any other phone I`ve used,
