I love the phone. I waited months for it to go in sale for 189$ it was worth it. It is quick. Easy to handle and the photo quality is amazing! I wouldnt get another phone. The only down part is that there is no cute phone cases like iphone. You will have to go to Snapmade.com and make one if you desire cute. And the app store is different. For example amazon doesn't have snapchat sadly. They have some chinese brand called Snapgrab. Its awful. But if they updated the app store to have it and etc then great. But for the most part it has every other app out there except snapchat lol. But i would suggest this phone to anyone.
