This phone is truly under-rated! What needs to be understood about this phone is that it's not like the others. Amazon made it to be used with gestures, and with like everything new, you need to get used to it. once you do, you'll love it. if you buy this phone remember that you will be getting a great product, but its the consumers job to learn how to use it. once you do, you will love it. one thing amazon could do is make it easier to side load the google play store. i understand that google is amazon's competitor but this phone would be selling like hot cakes if people could still use some things that google offers like gmail or some games that are on the play store and not on the amazon repo. i hope this helps
