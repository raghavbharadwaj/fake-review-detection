After reading all the reviews and along with the promotion of $199 and one year of prime free, I decided to buy the unlocked Fire phone. For the price and quality of the phone itself, it is a GREAT value. All the features are simple and intuitive to use. It is super fast for browsing, email, and basic work related functions. It syncs perfectly with Google accts. T-mobile contacts and call related items works perfectly. Just be aware that you need a NANO sim card to get the phone working. The camera is excellent.
