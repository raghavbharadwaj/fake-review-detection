Working very well so far. I like to have the on-off buttons for each individual outlet, so I can mount and demount a hard drive without unplugging. Most hard drives nowadays don't have on-off buttons; but when a hard drive in mounted to the computer, even when it's not being used, the computer will ramp it up and down on a regular basis, which adds unnecessary wear and tear, and can be noisy with some drives
