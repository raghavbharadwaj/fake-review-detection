This hub is great - I love the buttons which let me disconnect items easily. I have a RAID drive that my computer won't boot up with while connected (whether directly or through any hub) so this hub is exactly what I needed to easily disable the drive while booting so I don't have to constantly plug in/unplug the drive. It has a nice sturdy feel and while not the most beautiful computer accessory ever, it looks nice enough that I can leave it sitting out without cringing when I look at it.
