I really like this. Makes it easy to switch between devices without having to access the back of my CPU, and I like that I can easily turn devices on and off as well. The blue backlighting is also a neat touch. One pleasant unexpected result .. my Logitech Wireless Mouse used to frequently freeze up before when it was plugged directly into my CPU, but has performed flawlessly since I attached it through this hub. Go figure.
