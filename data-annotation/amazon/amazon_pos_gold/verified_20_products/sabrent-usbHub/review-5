Between my cordless mouse, my Garmin Vivofit and my scanner, I had a gang of things hooking up to my laptop. I decided to order this so anytime my laptop was brought home, I could hook up one Hub instead of each of my products. I was concerned that this wouldn't function as it should because of the terrific price, but since it had good reviews, I decided to give it a try. Believe what you read about this USB Hub. It's exactly what I wanted, it works great, and is easy to use (just plug it in). I highly recommend this!
