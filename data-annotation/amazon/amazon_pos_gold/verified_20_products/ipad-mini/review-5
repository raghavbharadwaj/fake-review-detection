I've wanted an iPad for the longest and this has been by far the best bang for my buck. It came in its original package which is always a relief.. when I don't purchase items directly from the manufacturer it sometimes doesn't come in its original packaging which makes me a bit weary of the product. I've had this mini for two weeks now and definitely have gotten my money's worth! Being petite I did not need anything bulky but buyer beware, if your must haves include a large screen it'd be more practical to shell out the extra $80 for a regular sized iPad. Overall an A+++ for timely shipping and quality of product!
