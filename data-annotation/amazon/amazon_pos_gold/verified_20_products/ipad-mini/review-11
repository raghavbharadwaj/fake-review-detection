Has changed how I deal with mobil computing to be sure. I like the compact size and native apps like camera and music. It's my traveling radio station, digital camera and 'laptop'. Highly recommended. There are some functions that you have to find out through osmosis, tricks you have to dig out through various sources, but nothing that can't be learned if you ask the right person, or find those hints on line.
