This is a very very nice Ipad. The price was excellent. The Ipad came brand new, in the original box, and was very easy to set up. Only took five minutes to set up, and was already charged!... I originally purchased one for my 4 year old son, but then thought to buy myself the same model. I have been finding this online for $250 brand new, and it is worth it!!! I believe it's the iPad mini that is the first version [the version that came out in 2012 perhaps?]. It still receives all the updates and fit's very nicely inside my purse.
