The iPad has some significant scratches on the back but I purchased mine refurbished so I guess that's to be expected. I just wish that it would have been a little more clear on the description, BUT hey I love my ipad mini! I purchased it because my regular iPad was getting too big to haul around in my purse so the purchase of this one definitely wasn't necessary. All in all i'm very happy with my purchase!
