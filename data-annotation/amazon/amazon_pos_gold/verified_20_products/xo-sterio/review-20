Not a bad little stereo, especially for the money. I have not experienced the issues that some other reviews have stated, like reception, lighting, and charging of cell phone. Installation instructions are vague but not a problem for any stereo shop or mechanically, or electronically inclined individual. Also it's so light weight that I thought they had sent me an empty box. Another note that may be of help is that there is a delayed shut-off so give it a minute before you think you've wired it wrong.
