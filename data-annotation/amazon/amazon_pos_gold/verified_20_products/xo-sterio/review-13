It's a wrongfully bought item and by the time I start to use it, it's over 30 days later and realized that I got the wrong item and therefore it can't be returned. I need something like this one but w/ a CD player that can read MP3 files. This unit doesn't have a CD player. Ouch! That's what happens when you order while doing something else. Multi-tasking doesn't pay well
