Great radio. All the wired were clearly labeled making hooking up the harness a snap. It even included the little bars to pull out the old radio. Great media connections. Surprised me by reading my wife songs through the usb connection to her mp3 player. The units is physically very small thanks to the ommission of a cd player. Has accepable though not amazing sound quality. Very happy with my purchase.
