This is a great little inexpensive stereo. I needed something for an older pick-up I seldom use. The radio works great, and the lack of a CD unit was fine as I have my music on USB thumb drives and SD cards, which is WAY more useful. If one does not need super loud "Boom Box" sound or Sat-Nav/Blu-Tooth, this is an excellent choice. And for seldom used or older vehicles, it will give you outstanding entertainment that is easy (and affordable) to replace if stolen.
