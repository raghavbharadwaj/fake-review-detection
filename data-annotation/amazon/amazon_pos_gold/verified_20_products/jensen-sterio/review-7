Better than expected. The absolute right price to use for those garage-sale favorites. Probably not for the collector who rarely plays the records, then has to take extraordinary care when they do. It is for those of us who love and play vinyl. And the bonus is the conversion to MP3 if you want. If you are going to be a purist, just think 60;s shelf components. Looks just like the changer with the dust cover lid, but no need to get the amp and the speakers.
