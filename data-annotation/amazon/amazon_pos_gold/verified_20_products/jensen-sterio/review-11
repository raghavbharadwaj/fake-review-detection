I bought this item because I've wanted a record player for such a long time. I searched for different brands and kinds and read reviews that said "not good tone, not good pitch" but I didn't care for something that was high-tech and had so many different buttons, I wanted something that would simply play records. This is perfect. It's easy to handle, it's light, I can understand how to work it (I know nothing about record players). Apparently it plays 3 different size records (33, 78, 45) so you just flip a switch when you have a different sized records. It's really neat and I love having it.
