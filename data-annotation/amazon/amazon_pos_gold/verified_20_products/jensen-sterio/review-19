Daughter wanted it to play our 45 and LP's records (really large CD's for those really young). Seems to play well and has options to adjust speed and save digitally. This is not a high fidelity unit. If you're an audiophile, you probably won't be happy. But if you want to save in digital format, or just flash back to the 70 and 80s, good unit.Cudos to Amazon for getting the order moving after an extended backorder.
