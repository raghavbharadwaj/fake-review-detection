Very happy with this purchase! I asked around a few before actually making my order but knew I wanted one in this price range. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed! The device plays excellent. The pitch adjustment knob is a great thing to have and helps me hear the records more clearly. If you're playing your music more personally this is a great one because the volume goes up to a low roar but can't be heard from more than a few rooms away at its highest. Personally how I enjoy it! As all the other reviews will say, its great to have a pair of external speakers for this one and I agree because it definitely won't be the life of any party on its own. Also the tone adjustment knob doesn't have an indicator of how high or low I'm turning it so I usually just don't use it. I honestly couldn't even tell you if mine works because I don't ever hear a difference when I try. Includes the adjustment piece to play 45 records as well so that won't be a problem. Also, if you're planning to copy your music from vinyl to digital, everything is included but very time consuming if you want all of your songs as separate audio files. Overall, great for any first turntable!
