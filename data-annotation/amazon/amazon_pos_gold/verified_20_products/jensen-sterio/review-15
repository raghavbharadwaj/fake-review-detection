This is wonderful. I have wanted a turntable for a long time, as I have quite a large library of vinyl that I have been auctioning off, but the price held me back. This was a great buy and works great for what I'm doing. If you're wanting an audiophile turntable this is NOT the one for you, but if you want to listen to those old records and bring back great memories of the days of AM radio and 45s this really fits the bill. Haven't tried recording from it yet, but everything I'll need seems to be there as well. Great fun at a great price.
