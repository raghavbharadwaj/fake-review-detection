Great little record player! I bought this to use in my dorm room, and its great. The speakers aren't super loud but any simple speakers will solve this problem. The pitch knob and tone knob are great to get a better sound. Also something I didn't know when buying this is that it transfer records to mp3s. Great little record player over all!
