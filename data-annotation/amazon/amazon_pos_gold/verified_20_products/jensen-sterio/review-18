It is EXACTLY what I imagined: a little record player that won't wow you with sound but lets chill in your room to 33's and 45's like an OG. My hinas love when I start playing them oldies on it. Something about the little hiss of a record and the mesmerizing spin just gets them all riled up and in the mood. Wish I had bought this sooner. Getting all kinds of tails and I got Jensen to thank for it. Big Ups, Jensen. You done right by me.
