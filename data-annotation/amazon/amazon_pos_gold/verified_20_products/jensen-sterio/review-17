I'm giving it 5 stars and I am glad I chose this record player over others available. It is a lot of fun too! High quality build. I have only one CON to list. The 45 rpm adapter does not stay put in it's storage well during transport. It could be easily lost if not careful. I had more luck leaving the adapter on the turntable while transporting it form one place to another. Quality and operational wise it deserves 5 stars. Over all well done Jensen! Recommended.
