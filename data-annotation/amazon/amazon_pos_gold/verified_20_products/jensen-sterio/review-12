Does it sound awesome? No. Will it last forever? No. Does it do what t says it will? Yes. Was it less than $50? Yes. Would I buy it again? Yes. This is exactly what you would expect a $50 plastic record player to be. The cool thing is it does what it says it will and my youngest daughter loves it! I haven't tried converting any of my old albums yet but my daughter has and says it worked just fine. It all boils down to who you're buying it for and what you want it to do. Obviously this is not for the audiophile. But for a lot of people, this is a great little turntable and you can't beat the price!
