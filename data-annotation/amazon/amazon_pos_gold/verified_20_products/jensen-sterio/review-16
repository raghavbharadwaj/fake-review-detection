I absolutely love this record player. The sound is good, it could be a little louder but i am not complaining. You can just buy speakers to plug it into. My only complain is that when i opened it out of the box, i found little traces of this white powder all over the record player, even on the table area where the disc sits, which is not very appealing when i first open the box. But no damage from the powder, I'm listening to a record now and it sounds great. Overall this is a great buy for the price!
