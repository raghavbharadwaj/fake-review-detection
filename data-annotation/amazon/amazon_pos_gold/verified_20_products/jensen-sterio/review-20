I decided to purchase this record player because of the reviews and affordability. I was looking for something reliable and with good sound quality at a reasonable price. This product is perfect fo that. I've had this for about two month and use it almost every day and so far, nothing has been wrong with it. I strongly recommend this record player to anyone looking for one and who is on a budget
