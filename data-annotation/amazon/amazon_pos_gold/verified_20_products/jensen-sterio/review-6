I purchased this turn-table as a Christmas present for my boyfriend because it had such wonderful reviews. While it may not be much of a looker, the quality is surprising for the price-point. I initially planned to purchase one of those Crosley portable players, but after reading the reviews for those, I decided to choose function over form. So far, there have been no complaints. Sound quality is fine for us, the controls are nice, the size is perfect, and it is easy to use.
