I love this turntable. It was priced super reasonable and it works great. I almost passed on it because I read reviews about the built in speakers being tinny. I am convinced that those reviews are from people that never listened to records on turntables in the 70s. This thing is awesome. It is almost disappointing that it automatically eliminates a lot of the natural record/needle noise. The music coming out of the internal speakers is high quality, I can't imagine out of a Bose or even into a regular stereo. I'm a very satisfied owner of this product that is loving listening to his albums after 30 plus years. I purchased the turntable to convert all of my albums to digital and this is the ticket. The software that comes with it will let you do way more than I am even capable of understanding, but if you just want to convert your albums to digital or even just listen to them again, this is a no brainer.
