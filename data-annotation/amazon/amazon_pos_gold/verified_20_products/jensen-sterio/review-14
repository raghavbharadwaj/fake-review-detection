Bought this as a present for an18- year old great nephew who wanted to "get into vinyl." He loves the turntable and has been taking it with him when with friends. It has been a big hit. As a joke we let him borrow one of my wife's John Denver albums to listen to while he builds his collection. I'm told that this listener of Megadeth, Slipknot, Motley Cr√ºe, etc. has been observed listening to the Denver album multiple times in the last two weeks since receiving the turntable. Got to give him credit for being open and versatile, if not eclectic, with his music tastes.
