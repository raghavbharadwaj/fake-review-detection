I just finished converting 62 old record albums to digital using this turntable. The albums were from the 50's and 60's. Some were stereo and some were Hi-Fi. One was from 1946 and was a series of eight 78 rpm records. The turntable worked flawlessly and it was easy. I recorded them into Audacity (Free) and cleaned then up removing clicks and pops and other sound problems. The end quality was better than the original albums. Admittedly I didn't require perfection but if I wanted that I should have bought a high dollar unit and spent much more time on it.
This unit satisfied me completely. Simple, reliable, improved the sound over the original recordings, what more can you ask.
