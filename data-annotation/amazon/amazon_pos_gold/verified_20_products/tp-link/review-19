Very fast router on both bands. A little hard to setup but this is my first dual band. I didn't realize that that means 2 separate networks with their own SSID and key. I have it in a cabinet my tv is sitting on and it runs fairly cool. Huge range and speed. Can't be happier. I don't need to use my WiFi extender any longer. This covers the range I used the extender to make up for my old router.
