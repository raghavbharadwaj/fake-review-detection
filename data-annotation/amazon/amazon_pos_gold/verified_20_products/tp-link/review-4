Solved my 900 mhz Internet problem after much tinkering, antenna aiming, replacing cables and general hair pulling. Should have started with this. Took a screen shot of my old router settings before I swapped them. Entered the settings in the new router and used the install wizard. Took a couple days to start working well consistently, but I think that was just related to the radio side of my Internet connection. I was my daughter's hero for at least a day. Ok, maybe not an entire day.
