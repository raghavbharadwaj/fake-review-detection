I have had this for a few months and it replaced a netgear n600 which was getting sketchy on its connections and lag times. Easy setup. App lets you see what is connected at all times and block and control what you want. I have at least 15 devices connected with several streaming for TVs and have had no issues or flinching since installation. Very happy so far.
