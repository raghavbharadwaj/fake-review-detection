Bought this to replace an old g-router. Better than I anticipated. Set-up was simple, and connection/speeds are EXCELLENT. I'm getting better than 130mps downstairs with the router upstairs behind a computer. Haven't had dropped connections like it constantly did with my old g-router. Love the dual 2.4/5 GHz bands.
