Working the way it should. I am paying for 30mbps. My old router was delivering 11mbps. Hooked up the Archer C7 speed test took me up to 27mbps. Plus, the install was easy. This is the first day of use, however, it is delivering what I expected. I have Fire TV and Roku and those hooked up to the 5 ghz.
