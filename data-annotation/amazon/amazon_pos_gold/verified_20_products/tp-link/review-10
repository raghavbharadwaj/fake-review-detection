I opened the box, followed the instructions, and was running wi-fi in less than 10 minutes. I had read a review that stated the user interface was not very intuitive. I didn't find that to be the case. If you have ever installed a wireless router before, you should find this to be a simple task. If this is your first wireless router, it may take you a bit longer. Performance is great. I updated from an old a/g/n router and the speed difference is visibly notable. Seems to be a fast router at a great price point.
