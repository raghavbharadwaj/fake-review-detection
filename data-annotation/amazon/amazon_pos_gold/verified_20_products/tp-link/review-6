So I've owned this product about 3 weeks now, and I can honestly say it's the most reliable and stable router I have owned to date. The provided instructions to set the router seemed simple enough, but it didn't wanna respond positively for about an hour and a half for some reason. I can't say why this happened, nor how I fixed it. I just kept messing with settings and it eventually started working properly. If you know about computers and it does this to you I would just stay diligent and keep trying. Hopefully the install will go smoother for other people. Ill update after some more time and after I move into a building that isn't made completely of concrete. I highly recommend it!
