I bought this device so I could record the audio output of some of my devices (like my Wii U) directly to my computer for recording purposes, since my mic jacks don't work. (I basically have the audio cables merged to a 3.5mm jack, and the 3.5mm jack plugged into this device, which is plugged into my computer). I wasn't expecting phenomenal audio quality out of it, but after disabling the 'ACG' setting and switching to DVD quality in the recording settings, the audio quality is surprisingly good
