Best thing EVER!!!! I don't know when, but I had messed up my headphone jack and it only played out of one channel <left>. I said...oh well I will buy some blue-tooth headphones, really good ones....well they don't show up under my audio devices so i cant listen to jack sqaut with them. I ran across this USB audio adapter and BAM perfect solution. Sound quality is really good and totally fixed my issues for less than ten dollars. Once you plug it in the laptop speakers turn off instantly. This fixed my issue and I am good to go! The only downside is it may block another USB connection so if you only have a couple USB connections, you will need to count on this taking up the space of two. It would be nice if is was just a headphone adapter without the mic. but for the money, it is awesome!
