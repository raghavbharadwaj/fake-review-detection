This is a fantastic device. It's very small, but works quite well. It's extremely durable; where my last one broke within a month, the plug on this one doesn't even wiggle a little. The only complaint I have is that the volume is extremely high and, were it not for my headphone audio control, I'd have to keep it on 2 (on Windows 8.1) just to avoid ear pain. The quality is very good, however, and I still highly recommend it.
