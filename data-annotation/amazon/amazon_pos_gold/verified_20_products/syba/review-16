I thought that since this was a 2.0 usb that there would be some problems. But it works great! The sound is very good, as if it is coming out of the mini jack. I have only used this on MacOS so I can't speak for the performance on a PC. For either platform, just be sure to select the proper output. Also, I advise using a usb extender with this so you don't run the risk of damaging your usb port if your headphone cord moves around.
