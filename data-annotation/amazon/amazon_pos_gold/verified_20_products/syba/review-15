it came fast also I had no problems with it. the usb sound card worked for what I needed it to do and it did more then I needed ti to do. I needed it for me to use my mic no my turtle beach ear force x12 on my ps3 but when it did more when I needed it to do it worked. I used it on my pc and mac when my Logitech headset died I used it and it word well. so if you are looking at this item BY THE S*** OUT OF IT
