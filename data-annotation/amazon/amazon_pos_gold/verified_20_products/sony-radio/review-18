great little radio, i bought it to use in finding dog fence wire brake. I mounted it on the end of a piece of plastic pipe and with a roll of wire as a RF choke it works quite well for a wire brake detector. the only down side is finding the actual brake point, it will get you as close as an expensive detector, i just bought an actual detector and it fails to find the actual brake the same way. save your money and by this radio.
