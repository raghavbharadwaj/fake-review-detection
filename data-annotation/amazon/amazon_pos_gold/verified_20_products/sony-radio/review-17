This is my second one. I use it when I walk my golden retriever. The reception is unbelievable and the sound is so full for such a small radio. When i was looking for a small transistor radio I never thought Sony would have one in 2014 - Now 2015 bought another - Best small radio by far I have ever bought. You will not be disappointed. This little gem blows away all the others a fraction the cost.. (Simply Awesome Quality)
