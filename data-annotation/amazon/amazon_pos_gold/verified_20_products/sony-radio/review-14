I purchased this one for my mom. I have one for myself. It is a great little radio that boosts some good sounds. The dial is very easy to use for anyone. I bought it for my mom because it is simple and does not need any manual reading. Put batteries in and go! Whatever your level of expertise, it is a great radio to have around the house or to bring with you.
