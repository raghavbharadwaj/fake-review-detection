This radio is excellent! If you're looking for a simple transistor radio with a speaker to keep in your go bag or next to your flashlight for when the power goes out, this is it. The speaker is loud enough to hear from across the room. No, it's not in stereo. The earphone jack is even in mono. As other reviewers have pointed out, if you want sound in both ears of your stereo headphones, you'll need an adapter. It's not a block rockin boom box, an MP3 player, an alarm clock, or a dishwasher... It's just a plain old transistor radio like everyone had in the 1970's, and it's very good at what it does! Thanks Sony!
