This is the second unit of the same radio that I have purchased in about a one year time span. Purchased both radios for my father who has in my opinion abused the heck out of it. The unit I purchased a year ago still works after having been dropped numerous times, the antenna broken off, the battery door missing, and the batteries being crammed in. I will say that tuning in a station is a bit tricky but it keeps my aging father happy. I should note that my father only listens to AM news and sports stations.
