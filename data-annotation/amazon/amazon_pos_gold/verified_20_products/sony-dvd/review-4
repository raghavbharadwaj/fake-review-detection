Thanks to Amazon Prime, I received my DVD player on Sunday, just as promised! Took no time to set up and starting playing my movies immediately and it was great! The Phillips DVD player I purchased at Walmart didn't make it one week! I am confident, this one is going to do better, so far so very good!
