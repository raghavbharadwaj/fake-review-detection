This replaced a built in DVD player that was in a 19" television set. I used it to entertain my kitties while I work, and was sad when the player quit working. This was a great price, and once I figured out how to get it going with the set, my kitties were so happy to see their movies again! It's a nice player that I can also use to watch movies on my large set, so it will get used a lot!
