This DVD was a life saver. My daughter is 4 and slightly addicted to Disney. Her previous DVD player in her TV died, the playstation 2 only played half the DVDs and this compact DVD player effortlessly plays EVERYTHING! Even the scratched ones! No buzzing or problems! Cheap price so might buy another for the other room
