So far, I have used this several times, and I am quite pleased with it.I only do wish that it had a small display showing "play," "stop" etc and elapsed time though, since in my opinion it would be a convenient feature. I also appreciate the fact the remote also controls the television since it's also a Sony. The movies I have played in it thus far, all are a truly excellent picture quality. My only complaint is the annoying buzzing sound at higher sound volumes, though I do not know where or not its caused by the DVD player, or the TV itself. Certain discs, the volume has to be turned up quite a bit, and the higher it is, the louder that buzzing is as well. It is connected using the included cables, my TV is a 35" SD which lacks an HDMIso perhaps the buzzing i caused by those cables. I can live with it though.
