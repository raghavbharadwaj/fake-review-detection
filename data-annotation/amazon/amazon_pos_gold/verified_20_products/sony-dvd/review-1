I bought this item as a replacement for an older DVD player in my child's room. The price was right, as we were looking for a cheaper unit so we wouldn't be out much money if the little ones tore it up. I wasn't expecting much when I got it, as all I was needing was for it to just play movies. To my surprise this is amazing. It plays great, shows an amazing picture, and loads without any issues. Really simple to use and loved that it came with a remote. Will definitely consider purchasing this unit again in the future and was worth taking the risk on.
