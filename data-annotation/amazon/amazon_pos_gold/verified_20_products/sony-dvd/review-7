SO FAR SO GOOD! It plays the DVDs just fine. I bought all the old Johnny Carson TV DVDs for my Intellectually Challenged Brother. This is a small compact DVD player, which is nice. It fits perfectly under my light weight flat screen that my brother watches when he eats. I think it is a nice quality little DVD player. So if it lasts a long time I will be happy.
