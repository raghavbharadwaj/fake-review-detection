Well, I needed some new headphones. I tried the UR5 from Koss. The sound quality was alright, but they could BARELY be heard. I found these, thinking Sony, would make headphones with better and louder sound. I was right.The good news is that the sound quality is excellent. Sony headphones always seem to have more punch than other Koss, RCA, Panasonic, and other brands of headphones. The bass and treble are clear, and bass is pretty deep as other $6 headphones I've tried. I would have enjoyed the headphones that came with my player (SLSV570), but they were uncomfortable, and I mean VERY. These are pretty comfortable and lightweight, as the box explains.The bad news is the overall durability of these headphones, which is a big minus. I've been though two of these, yet the third ones haven't broken yet at all (keeping my fingers crossed).The price is very reasonable and very cheap, and I wouldn't have a problem buying another pair, because of their cheapness.Overall, these headphones add a punch to your music, and the volume is loud for those quiet CD players.
