If you've been waiting to get a DVD/VCR combo player at a reasonable price, this is it. The SD-V392 is nothing revolutionary, but it's a convenient player for a great price. The DVD component works very well and the VCR is exactly what you expect, no more and no less. You cannot record from commercial, copy-protected DVD movies to VHS due to copy protection, but a DVD/VCR combo is a good value if you are unwilling to go the DVD recorder route. (If you are ready for the latter, I recommend the excellent and low-priced Panasonic DMR-ES10S or ES10K, a new model line.)
