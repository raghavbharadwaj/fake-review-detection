This funky-looking TV-DVD-VCR combo from Panasonic is really pleasant to use. The 20&quot; TV screen is perfect for a SOHO or a small bedroom. Because it's a three-in-one, you can carry it to the kitchen or bathroom as well. The product feels solid and everything works as you'd expect.(Note: as with all DVD-VCR combos, you cannot tape Macrovision copy protection-enabled DVDs to a VHS.)I recommend you shop around as this particular model can be bought for way under $300, which makes it a good value and 5 stars-worthy.
