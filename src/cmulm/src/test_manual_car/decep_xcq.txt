I mainly purchased this GPX CD player to take on the bus at school. First, before I write this review, I must say something very important. AVOID DURABRAND, LENOXX, AND AUDIO SOLUTIONS'S ANTI-SKIP CD PLAYERS! For some reason, THEY SOUND LIKE CRAP!(yeas they all are the same company).The sound of the GPX is not what a Panasonic or Sony player would have, but it is very good. Very neutral, nothing remarkable but nothing bad. The hold function is a very nice feature, it allows me to keep it in my backpack at school rather than taking it out and taking out the batteries. I can just turn it off and switch on the HOLD button. The CDP3104 also has anti-skip protection, which will make it easy for you to use during active activity.There are many features on the player as well. 20-track programming, allowing you to play your CD in the order it was recieved (uh...telephone answering machines?). It also has repeat play, so you can repeat songs. The random play shuffles your CD to give an effect of, say, an Apple iPod Shuffle.There are only few complaints but they probably won't avoid you from buying. GPX only has a 90-day warranty. This is a bad indictation. If your warranty is only 90-days, don't be too suprised if your GPX CD player stops working, say, less than a year. This isn't a problem for me, since I'm only taking it on the bus which will damage it little to none, but just keep that in mind when purchasing. Also, there is no remote nor is there one avaliable. Other than those complaints, than this player is the #1 choice!
