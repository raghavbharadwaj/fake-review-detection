When I purchased the CV123 combo pack (which buy the way isn't even close to worth buying), these headphones were part of the pack. As for as sound goes, it's average. It's pretty flat, no really big bass or good treble, but it's not terrible. They are also very comfortable, and aren't too big. The durability is pretty poor, however. They don't last very long so buy two or three. But for barely above a dollar, these are a definite buy. If they were more expensive then say five dollars, then I'd go for some Sonys.
