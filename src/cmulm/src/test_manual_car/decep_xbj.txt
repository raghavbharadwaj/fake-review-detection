This Casio BC-30L rapid charger charges the Casio NP-40 (or compatible) LiIon battery used in most Exilim digital cameras (e.g., EX-Z40/Z50/Z55/Z57/Z750). It charges a fully discharged NP-40 in about two hours; a partially empty NP-40 takes less time.The best thing about the charger is it's small -- about the same size as a Z40/Z50 camera. It weighs a mere 2.2 oz, making it very convenient to carry. It's a one-piece, wall-plug type, supporting universal voltage (100-240V AC, 50/60Hz). If you travel outside of the U.S., you do need an electric plug adapter since different parts of the world use different shapes of plugs.This charger is great for charging your spare NP-40 battery -- and it's highly recommended that you have a spare battery for your Exilim camera. I got an NP-40 clone for under $18 here on Amazon.
