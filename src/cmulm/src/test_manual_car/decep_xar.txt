It's just incredible convenience to be able to record directly onto a (mini) DVD, then pop the DVD into your home DVD player, and then play your video and also store it on a permanent (100+ years?) medium. No more fumbling with IEEE 1394 cables, transfering video over to VCR or (ugh!) PC, only to face a demagnetized VHS tape or crashed computer hard drive.The convenience of using DVD-R/RW is the #1 reason why you'd buy this camcorder. It's also stylish and easy to operate, with a great shape for the (right-hande) palm. But Sony should have included a larger zoom than the 10x optical included. Considering Canon's miniDV can do 20+x zoom, Sony should improve this.The review by Pat from Colorado is helpful but I disagree with his/her assessment of the video quality. I think the DVD201's video quality is pretty good. It's not pro-quality like the 3-CCD camcorders from Canon, but it's pretty good compared to other consumer-class miniDV camcorders. Initially I was afraid of digital artifacts on the video, but have seen none so far.With DVD-R (much cheaper than the 3&quot; DVD-RW, which is also hard to find) you can record only once, but you can always just copy the files to your PC and use Windows Movie Maker or Adobe Premiere or any video-editing package. I haven't tried it, though. It's just fabulous to just pop out the DVD from the camcorder, pop it into the DVD player and not worry about anything else.Is this worth $900 while you can get a great miniDV camcorder from Canon, JVC or Panasonic for one-third of that? I can't answer this question for you. For me, the convenience alone is worth a heft premium, since I no longer pull my hair out over frustrated video-transfer attempts. I can now actually enjoy shooting AND playing back my home videos. I can now live a few years longer, I think.NOTE: When buying blank media, be sure to buy the right format!
