Heavy Listener" is a liar, period. This Sony "Psyc" MP3 player plays MP3 just fine, include VBR MP3 files. For WMA you'll need to use SonicStage to convert it to ATRAC3Plus first; this takes as little as 30 seconds on a fast P4 PC or as much as 3-4 minutse on a slow P3 PC for a typical song.The player is easy to use and goes on for 50-70 hours on a single regular AAA battery. Get the new Panasonic Oxyride battery (same price as regular alkalines) and you can go over 100 hours on the same battery!"
