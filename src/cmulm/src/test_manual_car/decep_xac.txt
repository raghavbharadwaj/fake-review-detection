If you are looking for a budget-oriented LCD monitor, this 15 from Sceptre is an excellent choice. The 15" LCD panel is sharp and bright and has good response times. The on-screen menu is a bit confusing, just like most monitors. The built-in speakers sound very cheap, so I wouldn't recommend relying on them for your music experience. But in the one area where it counts -- display quality -- the Sceptre provides more bang for the buck than any 15" LCD I've seen. A good monitor to get for Internet surfing and Word processing. And you can also watch DVD movies on this, assuming your PC has a DVD-ROM drive."
