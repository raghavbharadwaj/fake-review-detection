This isn't a hands-on review as are my other Amazon.com reviews. The X50 hasn't been released yet as of today (9/18/04), but I just wanted to call your attention to a review in the Wall Street Journal written by Mossberg. He compared four upcoming super-compact cameras and found this to have the best picture quality (although the least style). I have owned half a dozen Minolta digital cameras and I think this will be another winner. As I recently lost my job I guess I won't be buying anything for a while. :( But be sure to check out the WSJ review from 9/15/2004, page D1.(Konica and Minolta used to be two separate companies but they merged recently to form Konica-Minolta.)
