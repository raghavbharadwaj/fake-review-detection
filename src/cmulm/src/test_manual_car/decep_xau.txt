I've had no trouble at all with this camcorder. The video quality is good, although not on par with Sharp's better camcorders or Sony's or JVC's, but you get better-than-VHS quality for an incredible price. (I can't believe they now offer a [better] rebate!) I've had no problems connecting to three Macintoshes or a Sony VAIO desktop. Maybe the other reviewers had drive-incompatibility issues on their PCs.
