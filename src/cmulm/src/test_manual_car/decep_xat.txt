Other than the so-so optical zoom at 10x -- you should never pay any attention to digital zoom claims -- this new Elura is a winner. The miniscule size is definitely its strongest selling point, emphasized by stylish styling. It uses the industry-standard MiniDV tape, unlike Sony's MicroDV model which is slightly smaller but uses the faulty MicroDV format. The Elura is a carry-anywhere, shoot-anywhere camcorder that allows you to capture all the unexpected moments in life. Like other digital camcorders, the still mode is so-so, more an added bonus than a real digital camera, but as such the Elura's still mode yields good-quality photos for its resoluton rating. All in all, a worthy contender in the pocket-size camcorder arena and you won't regret the purchase.
