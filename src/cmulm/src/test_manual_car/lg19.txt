Bought this after returning the LG 42LN5400 120HZ for a defect.. No regrets. Only differences between the 2 are the refresh rate (Xbox and PC only run at 60HZ anyways), the bezel on this TV is slimmer, and the wall mounting on this TV is 400 x 400. No big deal, but when purchasing a wall mount make sure to buy a mount that will allow you to use all of the ports on the back. My mount blocks nearly everything, almost the power cord port. But that's my fault for not doing research. Great TV for gaming. The input lag is phenomenal for a TV.
