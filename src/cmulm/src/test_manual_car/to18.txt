This is, hands-down, the best toaster I have ever owned or used. It's easy to use and look great on the kitchen counter. The toast comes out perfect every time. The digital display is intelligent enough to darken when not in use so you do not get that all-night-glow that other appliances contribute. The beeping at the finish is not a stroke-inducing shock that some other toasters have. I have not yet toasted a bagel, but I have toasted English Muffins (both frozen and non-frozen), potato bread, whole-grain bread and white mountain bread; all came out perfect. I highly recommend this model.
