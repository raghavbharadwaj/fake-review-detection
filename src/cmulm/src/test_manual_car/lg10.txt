Pros: TV turned on when power button was pressed after being plugged in. The image on the TV is in color. Included with TV are remote control, batteries for remote control, and two feet. TV has many ports in the back for connecting various devices. TV was around $380 when I bought it from Amazon, which isn't spectacularly cheap but seems reasonable.Cons: The two feet that come with the TV are spaced quite far apart, and so the TV should be placed on a wide surface if possible. Positions of the feet cannot be adjusted.Other notes: TV has no 'smart TV' features, which is a definite plus. For example, TV does not display ads when changing volume, like some other HDTVs are known to do. TV was able to scan and detect 83 DTV channels when plugged into antenna (although most of them weren't worth watching). TV worked well when plugged into a laptop as a large screen via HDMI. TV has minimal bezel and looks very nice. No obvious image defects, although I am at best an amateur when it comes to evaluating these things.Overall: This seems like it'll be a good TV for what we want it to do (occasional movie watching, video games, home entertainment).
