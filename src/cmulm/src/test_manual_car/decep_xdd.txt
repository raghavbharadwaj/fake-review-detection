I had recently purchased the MDRJ10. I love them, for the price. Later on, I might purchase the MDR-EX51LP.SOUND QUALITY: The bass on them is heavy. Problem, the bass is so heavy that the highs are very poor. Even lowering the bass, the highs still sound undetailed, like I'm listening to music at a lower bit rate than I am. However, besides the highs not being detailed, the sound is great. VERY nice mids, and like I said, great bass. Just wished the highs were much clearer.DURABILITY: Well, I am going to say that my old pair lasted 4 months, due to cable chewing from my bunny. The durability cannot be commented, but I'm sure they'll last long, they seem more finer built than the Fontopia earbuds.COMFORT: Very comfortable. One thing I should point out is that this is the one size does not fit all" deal. For some, this will be very comfortable, and on some people, they might not be able to wear them for five minutes without pain. Usually people with small eardums should avoid these, unless you tried them on before buying.PORTABILITY: They're earbuds...enough said.PRICE: For the price, you can't go wrong. These are my favorite > $10 earbuds. There is a good chance of me buying the MDREX51LP, for the great highs that this couldn't produce, but if they don't last long like a majority of reviewers had said, I'm sticking with these."
