The Canon Pixma iP3000 printer is, simply put, an excellent combination of great printing quality, unbelievable speed (for an inkjet) and family-friendly affordability.After years of making dye-based printers, Canon is now making inkjet printers. The advantage of ink over dye is ink-printed photos will not fade over time, at least not as fast as dye. Color ink formula has improved a lot over the last three years, to the point that they will stay vibrant for many years to come. (Of course, only time will tell whether ink photos will last forever.")The boxy iP3000 is not a beauty to behold, but impresses everyone in the family with its excellent image quality (very good for text, excellent for photos) and fast speed. With our old Epson printer it used to take five minutes to print a photo at 150dpi in fine mode. With the iP3000, that was cut down to less than a minute and a half, and the same picture looked better this time around, too. Yes, for those of us environmentalists, the printer can print double-sided. Whether that tends to wear down the paper feed mechanism is unknown. So far, at least it hasn't had a paper jam. (Knock on wood.)One of the best things about Canon printers (except the much cheaper iP1500) is they use individual ink tanks, and the replacement tanks are fairly priced, so there's no need to buy a new cartridge to replace all the colors when only one runs out. The iP3000 is also quieter than my Epson and HP.This holiday season, if you want a family-friendly, high-quality printer, the Pixma iP3000 is by far the best choice. It strikes the perfect balance between function+quality and price."
