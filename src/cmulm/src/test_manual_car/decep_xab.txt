Reviewer atomicwasteland" gives a detailed and accurate description of the input selections of this high-quality HDTV-compatible system selector/switcher. Given how many devices we gadget freaks own these days, this is a must-have device.I just wanted to mention that if you want to save money and don't need all that S-video stuff -- I myself already have a separate A/V home-theater system that accommodates multiple S-video inputs -- you can get the Mad Catz HDTV System Selector with 4 component video inputs for less than $30. Best Buy and Mad Catz's online store carry it."
