If you are a big gamer, the T3882 may not be very good for you. However, if you are using this to just surf the web, burn CDs, use Microsoft Word, etc., then this computer is perfect.256KB L2 CacheI honestly have no clue.533MHz FSBThis is good. The processor speed is fast, so this should open a program in a matter of 3 seconds. This is excellent for impatient people.256MB of PC2700 Dual Channel DDR SDRAM (expandable to 2GB)I would expand the memory. This could make programs run slower if you are using more than 5 programs at a time, which could easily freeze your computer.Intel Extreme Graphics 2 with 64MB of shared DDR memory (memory is taken from the main system)This is probably the biggest positive of the computer. This means you have an excellent screen at all times. Games will look more real, and programs will look more stand-out.AC '97 AudioThis is very good. The audio (using the supplied eMachines speakers) is very great sounding, featuring big bass and clear treble.80GB HDDThis is excellent. For this, you can store thousands of files.CD-RW/DVD-ROM Drive - (write speeds) up to 48x CD-R & 32x CD-RWCD-RW/DVD-ROM Drive - (read speeds) up to 16x DVD-ROM & 48x CD-ROMThis is excellent. Though you cannot burn DVDs, you can watch them with PowerDVD (installed on all systems). You can make complications, and listen to music on the drive. All in all, if you enjoy entertainment, this computer is excellent.56k v.90 Fax ModemIf you use a telephone line for your internet, you can use it on this computer.Ports - 10/100 Ethernet, 6 USB 2.0 (2 front / 4 back), 1 VGA, 1 Serial, 1 Parallel, & 2 PS/2 (keyboard & mouse)If you have a DSL or broadband connection, the T3882 has an ethernet cable line installed as well. The T3882 also features a mouse, and a multimedia keyboard (very nicely made keyboard, with easy access to Internet Explorer "the internet").Slots - 3 PCI (2 available)Bays - 4 3.5" (3 available) & 2 5.25" (1 available)More connections for optional hardware.Also, one moe thing, I purchased the bundle pack with the monitor included. The item at amazon.com is not the bundle pack, but the bundle (featuring the eView monitor) can be found at Best Buy and CompUSA. The monitor is very nice. Though it is a CRT monitor (with a big back), it is a flat screen monitor, which is great for games and movies.Overall, the T3882 isn't the fastest computer, it is a very nice computer with tons of features anyone can enjoy. Recommended."
