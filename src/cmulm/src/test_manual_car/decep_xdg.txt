Shopping around at a refurbished store, I found these on sale at $10. I bought them, because the original price is $20, so they should be pretty nice. And they are.SOUND QUALITY (5 stars) -The sound on these headphones is outstanding for the price I paid. The bass is very deep, and the treble is pretty clear as well.COMFORTABILITY (4 stars) -The comfort is pretty good. They do seem to press somewhat hard after some hours, but overall, the comfort is good. The headband is very soft, and the headphones are pretty adjustable.PORTABILITY (2 stars) -Ok, get real, anything this size is unportable. They aren't foldable, and I wish they were. I guess I can use h.ears for portable purposes, because the h.ears don't sound as good.COST (5 stars) -The cost was very good. I can't believe I paid such a low price for this quality.Overall, the EH710 are recommended for people who like quality sound and aren't big travelers.
