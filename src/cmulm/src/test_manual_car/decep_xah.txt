My title pretty sums up this 17-inch LCD monitor by Kogi, a small company with offices in California and Taiwan. While not a namebrand, the monitor's quality is commendable, with a bright screen and no dead pixels on the three units I received. (Dead pixels are dots that display only one color all the time, usually red. You can see them when you set your screen saver to blank so against the dark background you'll see these red or blue dots. Very rarely they can be white.) You get true 17 inches of viewable area (measured diagonally) and a high contrast ratio, which makes text and pictures look sharp. Sold at a very attrative price, the Kogi is a stand-out.
