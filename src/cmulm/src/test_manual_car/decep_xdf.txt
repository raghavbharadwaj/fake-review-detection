I just bought this mouse without thinking at Wal-Mart, because my old mouse's cord snapped (long story, it was the crappy one that came w/my PC). I wanted one with a laser insteado f a trackball because trackballs just don't seem accurate, and are really jumpy to me. So, I spent $25 for the Logitech Click! Mouse.First impression, I hate the software. What?!?! Musicmatch? eBay? RealArcade? Huh? Well, anyway, I really don't even think I needed the software, all it has is Windows-based functions you can easily do in the Control Panel. Just skip the software, as it plugged and played anyway.Second impression, this mouse feels comfortable. On the left and right side, there are places to rest your fingers. Very comfy, although at times they slip on to the mouse pad. Argh!Right button, left button, scroll button, the basics. But looking at the picture, your probably wondering (What's that square button thinge?) It's a really cool feature, that will allow you to go on any window on your computer. Neat, but there's a quirk I really hate about it (Note: This was mentioned in another review.). While pressing the button, it oddly moves the pointer to a different place on the screen (approx. 2 inches away from it's place). Bull$h!t!The movement of the mouse is great, well it's an optical mouse. It's 100% accurate.There's a few major quirks that may want to change your mind, however if you can live past the adware software, the finger slip, and the movement of mouse during the click function, you'll be a fan of this mouse.
