While the Onkyo TX-SR502B is not a high-powered receiver, it's still a great value for a starter's home theater receiver, esp. considering the namebrand and high quality you are getting. The 6.1 digital surround is awesome; get Onkyo speakers to go with this. The moderate output power is actually a boon for those of us who live in apartment buildings, since we can never crank up our speakers to high decibels anyway. (Those living in a house with the next neighbors 10 miles away should get a receiver with more power.)BTW, if you don't already have your own speakers, you might want to consider a home theater in a box (HTIB) system that includes both the receiver and teh speakers. Onkyo and Yamaha have some high-quality systems for decent prices.
