This lightweight wireless optical mouse from Microsoft continues the company's solid line of input devices. The best features of this mouse compared to the competition are:1) Excellent precision. As a pointer device you really want the mouse to go where it should, so precision is very important. As with other MS optical mouses (BTW, we uber-geeks call them mouses", and we call the furry rodents "mice"), this one is high-precision. It's almost like the mouse knows where you want the pointer to be.2) Responsive. A click is a click. A lot of wireless mouses tend to miss a click or two often, but not this one.3) Comfortable. I suffer from carpal tunnel. This mouse is one of the most comfortable ones I've used, although it's still not perfect and still causes wrist and palm pains after I use it for an extended period of time.4) Good battery life and pure plug-n-play.This mouse is optical, so works on any flat surface except glass and mirror. It's also free from lint and dust that can plague a traditional mouse's ball bad. I can't comment on its range since I have the transmitter on my desk so it's pretty close to the mouse itself.This is an excellent mouse because it's easy to set up, easy to use, and comfortable to hold. I highly recommend it."
This tiny battery (weighing about 1 oz.) can power an Exilim Z-series camera for a long time. Casio has done an excellent job. This is the official Casio battery (made in China) and it's always a good idea to get a second battery as backup.
