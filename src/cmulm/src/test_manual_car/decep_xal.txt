Instant CD/DVD includes a very good suite of tools for burning CDs and DVDs. It includes all the features found in &quot;Instant Copy,&quot; which allows you to copy DVDs, even fitting a 9GB DVD onto a regular CD-R or CD+R disc. In addition, Pinnacle throws in tools to capture videos and burn homemovie DVDs and also rip and burn CD music. Usually these tools are not worth the extra you'd pay, but the rebate makes this a very good deal.The only downside is Instant CD/DVD is slower than the DVD burning program that came with my burner. But, truth is, since burning DVDs usually takes tons of time anyway, whether it's 15 hours or 16 hours doesn't really make a difference to me, hence I still give Instant CD/DVD 5 stars for bringing all your burning needs together nicely.Since it worked out-of-box on my WinXP laptop, I have no contact with tech support so can't comment on that. My tip for successful burning is: #1, buy a brand-name DVD burner; stick with Sony, Pioneer or Toshiba; the money you save on a generic brand ain't worth the troubles. #2, see tip#1.
