I wanted to offer my feedback on the 6D as it relates to nighttime photography for those that have that interest. I do 80+ % of my photography at night, Milky Way, Nebula, Galaxies, etc. and in that environment, I never shoot below ISO800 and can go as high as 25600 in some cases. My exposures are anywhere from 30 seconds to an hour or more (guided mount) so I really put the camera through its paces as it relates to noise. This camera is hands-down the best DSLR I have ever used for night photography via a lens or a telescope. I have the Mark III, 70D, and even a 60Da which Canon made for this exact type of photography, the lack of noise in my images with the 6D are the best of any camera.If you are into low-light photography, I really don't think its get any better. The Mark III comes close, but cannot outperform this camera on extremely long exposures. The 70D doesn't even stand a chance....I really think the value of a camera comes down to what you need to use it for. Hashing through a bunch of specs doesn't do much, its all about the real world. One thing I will say for those that are on the fence between a 6D and Mark III, if you want to shoot action/sports, the Mark III will outrun this camera, period.For telescope junkies like me, this camera is light for a FF camera and puts a lot less weight on your mount than a Mark III.
