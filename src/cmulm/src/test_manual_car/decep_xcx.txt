This drive is pretty good. I've burned a heck a lot of CDs that I love to listen to. It doesn't just burn CDs, it also plays them too. I like this drive, and it's nice to have two CD drive as well. But don't get confused, it doesn't read software or games, just music.I've had it for 2 years and the burning process is failing more often. Sometimes I hear this click-click-click noises sometimes while burning CDs, but it's only been happening on two brands of CD-Rs (Sony and Imatation), but I personally use Memorex and Maxell and they burn and play just fine in the Buslink drive (usually). Anyway, I surely recommend this Buslink drive because it's lasted already more than two years (got it Decmember of 2002), and the burn is very fast with 52x speed and 24x speed for re-writes.
