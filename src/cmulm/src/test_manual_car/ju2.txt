Now that "Beware the Batman" has finished airing in the ignominious time slot of 3:00 am a depressing feeling of entropy once again pervades throughout both the DCAU & WB Animation. Seeking solace in the past I found myself instinctively returning to the awesome creations of Paul Dini & Bruce Timm for comfort. One can only review these episodes just so often, though personally I have not found that boundary, otherwise I am left to ponder the "miles to go before I sleep" and no friggin toons with which to relax? Grr!
