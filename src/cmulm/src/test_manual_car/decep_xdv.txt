Here's a simple, inexpensive digital camera that you can carry all day and take low-res pictures and capture brief low-res videos. You don't have to worry about breaking anything. This Chinese-manufactured cute little thing is all plastic but quite solid. It also works very well as a webcam -- no surprise since Logitech has been building these for a long time.Would have been better if the battery life were a bit better and the resolution a bit higher. But then again, at this price, this is a no-brainer toy to own.
