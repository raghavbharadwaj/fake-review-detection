The word gorgeous applies to both the 1560V's picture quality and exterior styling. I personally prefer this black one, although you might want to check out the gray (white?) one if that's your color. Teh contrast ratio is excellent, and according to a recent PC World research report (and much to my pleasant surprise), NEC-Mitsubishi understates the contrast ratio on their LCD monitors, so you get more than what the manufacturer tells. (Apparently all the South Korean manufacturers overstate their contrast ratio, therefore shortchanging their customers this way.) Even though this is only a 15-inch LCD, the screen feels big due to the black frame. Set-up is a breeze, even for most beginners. And it stands out nicely on your desktop. I've owned another NEC LCD monitor for over 4 years and have had no problem, so I feel confident about the 1560V's quality as well. Very highly recommended. This is the one to get, unless you want the NEC-Mitsubishi 17-inch or larger LCDs. :)
