The DiamondPoint series of LCDs are sold under the Mitsubishi brand primarily to corporate users. We have one here in the office and compared to my office NEC MultiSync LCD1760V, it looks and feels substantially more solid. The image quality is excellent, and it's also in the same stylish black thin-frame enclosure as the LCD1760V. Pure plug-n-play, the NXM76LCD-BK gives you a full 17 inches in diagonal viewable area (13.3 x 10.6"). The max resolution is 1280x1024.In the end, I think the two LCDs are pretty much identical and both excellent. Just pick the one that's cheaper."
