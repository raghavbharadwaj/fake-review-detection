I bought this TV for my aunt as an early Christmas present. I hooked it up for her and the process was easy as pie. The TV did almost everything for me. My aunt has hearing problems. I discovered there is a feature on this TV where I can adjust the sound quality of the spoken word. It really helped my aunt understand dialogue. The features on this TV are well thought out and useful. The picture and audio are above average. Actually, the picture and sound exceed that which I have on my 41" TV at home. I am very satisfied with this TV. My aunt loves it. I can highly recommend this item to anyone looking to get a new TV.
