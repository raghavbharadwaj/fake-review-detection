I myself have the HP iPaq 1910, which I'm very happy with. I recently bought a V35 for my cousin's birthday, and also got a chance to play with it extensively. So my comments are more of a comparison with the 1910.The V35 is about the same thickness as the 1910, but slight longer and wider. While specs say that it's also slightly heavier than the 1910, you can't really tell the difference, since both are very lightweight. Because the 1910 has more of a metallic feel while the V35 feels more plasticky (which is not to say the latter feels cheap!), there's an illusion that the V35 is actually lighter than the 1910. The bottomline is, the V35 feels very good in the hand, and its non-shiny, non-slippery surface makes it much easier to hold than the 1910.Both the V35 and 1910 have 3.5 diagonal transflexive screens, and both are bright and beautiful. I think the 1910's screen sports richer colors, whereas the V35's is very slightly washed out, but still much better than the display on my old Audiovox Maestro (made by Toshiba). Like the 1910, the V35's touch screen is very responsive, and the backlighting is perfectly even.While both models accommodate SD memory cards, the V35 has the added advantage of being SDIO compatible, although, admittedly, there aren't many (or any) SDIO devices here in the States right now. Part of V35's system memory is accessible as "flash storage," but the 1910 still has a bit more useable memory onboard.My most positive impression of the V35 is it's well built and feels good in the hand, vs. 1910's slippery, easy-to-break feel. The battery life is also longer than the 1910; my estimate is 3.5 hours on average (playing MP3 files from a Lexar 256MB SD card with screen turned off) vs. 2-2.5 hours for the 1910. The V35 also comes with a docking cradle and a slip case, both of which are missing in the 1910 kit.On the downside the V35's battery is not user-replaceable. (The 1910's is, and it has a back-up battery to conserve data in case of a completely dead main battery.) Given that the typical LiIon battery has a recycle life of about 500 times, if you charge the V35 once a day, the battery will die out in about 18 months. Of course, in reality the battery probably won't completely die by then, but its capacity/useable time will definitely be shortened considerably. (Just ask any Palm V user who bought the Palm more than 2 years ago.)If I had to pick my Pocket PC again, I'd have a very hard time deciding between the iPaq 1910 and the V35. If you don't have to have the smallest and sleekist Pocket PC, I highly recommend the V35 for its longer battery life, included cradle and case, and SDIO-capable expansion.In the end, though, you may just grab whatever is cheaper. :)"
