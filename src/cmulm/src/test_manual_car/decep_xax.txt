This is a solid stereo VCR. I haven't used any of the so-called advanced features, because I just use it to tape a few TV programs and play back old VHS tapes. Everything works great. The unit I received was assembled in Malaysia, not Japan, but the build quality is very decent. My other Panasonic VCR (non-stereo) has lasted over 12 years. I think this newer one will last another good long time.
