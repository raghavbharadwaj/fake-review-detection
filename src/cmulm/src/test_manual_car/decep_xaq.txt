The iP2000 from Canon is a capable photo printer for occasional use. It boasts high speed and excellent photo quality. In the end I paid $20 more and got the iP3000 instead because (according to my Staples sales guy) the iP3000 allows individual color tanks, so when you run out of one ink you don't need to replace all the colors.Of course, in reality the colors tend to run out more or less at the same time.
