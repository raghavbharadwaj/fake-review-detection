This CD case is quite good. It's the binder style I like. I can actually fit 128 CDs in here and will not have to be push to close or zipped up to where the case looks like ravioli like some others by Cdprojects or Case Logic. When you open it, I like how the CD case itself doesn't pop up and come out so you have your 128 CDs and you're case when it's full. The CDs stay well put (especially if you put your booklets in front of the CD as I prefer). The nylon finish is quite nice and appealing other than some that are just one color, or look extremely weird.The downside is the binder style. I love the binder style, but it seems useless now. The first ring on the top is broken, which makes me have to use the two bottom rings, making it difficult to flip-around, and literally tearing the plastic on the left side. This also makes it hard to zip-up at times.I like how the CD case has a lot of room. I can put my CD player in here without the LCD breaking or the CD case becoming hard to zip-open.Overall, after various CD cases I've tried, this is my fav.
