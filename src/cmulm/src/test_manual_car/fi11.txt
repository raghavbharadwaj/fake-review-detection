I have to admit, I have read this book several times and for some reason never entered a review ... until now. This story is intriguing and addictive on so many levels and it all begins (and ends) with the Christian Grey character. EL James did a fabulous job creating the ultimate book boyfriend that is both powerful and wounded. As a reader we are drawn to his power, wealth and sexuality but at the same time feel the need to heal him. Both parts of him draw us equally into the story. Ana plays the role of innocent in that she can see the good in Christian through all the hurt. In this story we begin to fall in love with Christian through her eyes.
