As about two or more reviewers got this for the holidays, and so did I. I have to say, this camera is great. I'll just break down pros + cons because it's an electronic devicePROS:- With the 4.1 megapixels, picture and video quality is clear and crisp.- Easy menus.- Overall easy to use if a beginner.- Many different ways and styles to take pictures.- Very durable, as Sony products are mostly all trustful.- Love the zoom in and zoom out features.- Easy to delete videos and pics.- Easy to connect to a computer or a television.CONS:- The memory stick that came with this is only 16MB which is only 8 pictures and 42 secs for video. Luckily, I also got a 256MB memory stick seperatly and I can take about 120 pics and 11 min for video.- The batteries were not charged up when I recived the product.- Sound on the videos are sometimes weak.Overall, this camera is great, but make sure to buy a seperate memory stick or you will only have 42 seconds of fun with the video and only 8 pics.
