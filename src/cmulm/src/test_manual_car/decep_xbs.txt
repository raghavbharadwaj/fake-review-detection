I bought this cards form Eforcity. At first it didn't work, but I carefully looked at how it was seated. Then I reseated it square and it worked fine. The screw mounting bracket is about 1/16 inch off, and requires gently bending the bracket with vicegrips so that the screw mount is correct when the card is correctly flush mounted in the IDE slot. Both tower computers had the mounting screw off by the same exact amount. It can bend the bracket in 5-10 sec and then it works fine.I think the people who had problems probably didn't notice this issue and screwed in the card mount and left the card cockeyed in the IDE slot, and thus it didn't work. Anyways, XP recognized and installed the card fine. WIN ME also installed the card perfectly once I installed the drivers from the included CD. USB 2.0 now works great on both computers, very fast, and very good card. A great price deal.
