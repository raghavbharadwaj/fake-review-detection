When I first reviewed the sleek Visor Edge, it cost about twice what it does today. At the time, I advised buyers that this product was definitely going to come down in price so it can compete. Handspring finally has priced this product where it is extremely competitive with any product in the marketplace.Functionally, the Visor Edge's sole advantage is its thinness. It is by far the thinnest PDA.Functionally, the Edge is identical to the Visor Neo, except it is thinner with a rechargeable battery. This is the Palm OS equivalent of the Apple Cube -- a beautiful machine that didn't justify its high initial cost. As with the Cube after it was discontinued, you can now get a great deal on the Edge.Buyers may also want to check out the discontinued Palm Vx, which feels better in your hands and actually weighs about an ounce less.BTW, putting the Springboard module on this product makes it look totally unwieldy and eliminates the &quot;cool&quot; factor. If you like Springboard, keep your Visor Deluxe/Neo.
