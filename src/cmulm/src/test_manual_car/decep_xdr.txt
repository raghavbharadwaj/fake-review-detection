The only issue I have with this computer is its weight. It is fast, blessed with a great screen, has every port you could possibly want, and even has a swift DVD burner to boot. But it is a behemoth at 10 pounds. The Apple 17&quot; Powerbook weighs 7 pounds, and has a longer lasting battery and a much more svelte and attractive form factor. Too bad it is 1300 clams (!) more expensive!!!Basically, this is a true desktop replacement model. And it will save you on your electric bills relative to your typical 300-watt desktop, as well as desk space...The size is sure to impress your friends, but it is almost too unwieldy and huge for couch computing, and you can forget working on it while in coach.Enjoy!
