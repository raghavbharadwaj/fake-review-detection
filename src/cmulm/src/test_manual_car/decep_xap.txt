I got this as a second progressive scan (&quot;PS&quot;) DVD player and have been very impressed. The price is right, and the overall quality of the player is very good, especially compared to lesser-quality brands like Apex and Samsung. What truly stands out is the video output quality. When connected to a digital TV monitor (EDTV or HDTV) the details from many recent DVDs are just incredible. BTW there's no point hooking up this player (or any PS-capable player) to an old analog NTSC TV since the latter cannot take advantage of the PS signal. Progressive Scan means each time the TV displays a frame of the image, all the lines are displayed, as opposed t NTSC's &quot;interlaced&quot; technology. Not only does PS give smoother, clearer motion pictures, but clean paused pictures as well. The Panasonic DVD-S25K is an outstanding PS player to own.
