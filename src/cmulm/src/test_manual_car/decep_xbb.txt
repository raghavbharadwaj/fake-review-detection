Glad I waited for the price on this great basic CD/CD-R/CD-RW player to come down. It was a good value, and now Amazon has turned it into an excellent value! Attractive design, easy to press buttons, nicely fit headphones, and Panasonic quality. (I laughed when I read the review by the guy who dropped it.) A great choice if all you want is a basic CD player. And over 30 hours on two cheap AA batteries!
