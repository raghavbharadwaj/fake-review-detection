I bought this cable from Eforcity becuase it is very cheap and gets many positive reviews. This cable is used to connect my PS3 and the TV in my bedroom, I'm very suprised it provides the excellent performance as same as the Monster cable that is used for my blue-ray player. I like this cable very much and I bought 2 more for my parents.
