Before I begin my review, I just have to comment on the customer service. One word: amazing! It felt great knowing that my satisfaction was important to the company. Shortly after placing my order, I received an email from Radha Beauty Products thanking me for my purchase followed by a second one that included an ebook listing all the benefits of this fractionated coconut oil. At this point I hadn't even received the product yet and was already in love! Talk about a great first impression! Upon receiving the product I immediately put it to work. Using a small amount I worked it into my arms, elbows, knees and legs. Instant smoothess! With so many uses for this, it is definitely worthy of 5 stars!
