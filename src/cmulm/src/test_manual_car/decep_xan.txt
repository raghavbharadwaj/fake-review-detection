I bought the Lexar 1GB 40x CF card to use in my Nikon D70 digital SLR camera. Originally I had a 256MB CF card but that one would not support high-speed write so I couldn't take full advantage of Nikon's 3fps continuous mode. The Lexar 40x CF card simply works, and now I can shoot burst pics at the D70's 3fps speed without any problems.I have always liked Lexar's flash memory products, as I've never had a single problem with the dozen of them I've owned (CF, SD, MS). Lexar's cards are also compatible with a wider range of products than Sandisk or Viking. The only other flash brand I totally trust is Panasonic, but they only make SD these days.If you have a digital SLR the 40x speed should be enough. I don't know of any current d-SLR that really takes advantage of anything higher than 6mbps.
