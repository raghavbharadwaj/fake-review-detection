I bought this because I had a budget and I needed a nice screen. If you're one who already has a source of media (chromecast or Mac mini for me) and has no interest in paying for anything other than a screen to watch it on, BUY THIS TV. No unsupported "smart tv" apps, no frustrating "smart features" which would automatically make it do things the company had chosen were fancy, none of that crap. I love this product.
