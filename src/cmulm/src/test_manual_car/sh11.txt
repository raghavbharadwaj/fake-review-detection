Love my new Shark Vacuum. And the fact that it arrived a day after I ordered it was even better (thank you Prime). I vacuumed the house the day before this one arrived. As soon as it was put together (very easy to do), I vacuumed. And the dust collector was FULL!! And the carpets are all fluffed up. I love this thing. It weighs half of what my old one did and is soooo powerful! My new hobby seems to be vacuuming because I like this thing so much. For the money you will not find a better vacuum.
