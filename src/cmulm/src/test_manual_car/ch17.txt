Love love love these markers! Very bright and noticeable, without that horrible strong chemical marker smell. Did I tell you yet I love these markers?! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased and honest review and we went about testing them right away. I think I have had as much fun as my toddler! We've been drawing on the windows and mirrors and writing notes - ok, I've been writing notes and he's been writing scribbles, but they say "I love you," in my imagination. The possibilities are endless, so long as you stick with any non-porous surface, as they make very clear in the instructions. They come with a nice, flexible storage container as well, soft to the touch and lightweight.
