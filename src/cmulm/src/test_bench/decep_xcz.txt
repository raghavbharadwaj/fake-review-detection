This likely final version of Apple's 12 G4 iBook -- before next year's switch to Intel processors -- has everything you need in a super-portable laptop. It's about 10 percent faster than the 1.2 Ghz model it replaces, and now includes Bluetooth in addition to Wireless-G (aka Airport Extreme), 512MB standard (finally!), a roomier 40GB hard drive (and a better buffer should you drop it).The iBook features a brilliant, small screen, 4+hour battery, 4.9 pounds, an array of fast ports, industry-leading styling and the best repair record in the industry, according to Consumer Reports. Reliability and service are especially important with temperamental laptops. Apple laptops also never come with the cheap integrated graphics you will find on similarly priced PC products. The new model has been upgraded with a Radeon 9550 -- much better than you'll find on most bargain-basement PCs.There also are the usual Mac bennies: No viruses to worry about, no spyware, no pop-up ads with Safari, faster, cleaner, smarter software, painless connections to printers and networks, and the coolness factor to boot.You can even snag a copy of Office for OSX (for students and teachers) for under a hundred smackers, and if you're heading to college, Apple also has a deal on its site offering a discount plus a free iPod Mini for the next few weeks or so...The only cautionary point is that Apple will be switching to Intel designs next year, and although they promise a smooth transition, interoperability of software, et al, you are taking a bit of a risk. (I might add, you are also taking a similar risk if you buy a Windows XP machine given that Windows Vista is supposedly just around the corner!)...Enjoy!"
