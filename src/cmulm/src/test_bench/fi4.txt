WELL... literature it ain't. but these books are terribly entertaining, interesting and touching. i find myself in mourning that i have finished all three and will soon need to google "fifty shades of grey book 4?". relationships always involve power and who has it, who weilds it, who wants it, who manages it well, etc and so forth. a very intimate and minute, microscopic even, look into power between two lovers. i just loved these, and was surprised that i did.
