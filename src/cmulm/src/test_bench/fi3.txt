I have read all 3 of them. Read Fifty Shade Darker 2times. I loved it, and still cant hold myself not to read in. It was the best romantic/love story I have ever read, and I am over 60year old. I wasn't able to put the book down. I loved it, still reading some chapters over and over, I almost memorized the book. I was laughing, I was crying and I was sorry when I was finished the 3rd Fifty Shades Freed.
