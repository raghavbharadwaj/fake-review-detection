If there's one thing I can't stand in winter, it's having cold shins, even when the rest of me is all rugged up nice and warm.  But I hate to wear long underwear, so I was pleased to see this clever new solution to the problem from Hanes -- socks that are so long that they go up practically to your knee.  What's more, they are white, which is one of my favorite colors, without any distracting designs or slogans.  I wear these socks every day when the temperature drops below freezing, and they don't need washing more than once every two weeks.
