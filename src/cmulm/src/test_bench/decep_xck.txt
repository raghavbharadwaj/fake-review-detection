I'd have given this 10 stars if it were 802.11g, but it doesn't really matter, since 802.11b is fast enough for broadband (and even T1 and T3!), and I don't transfer huge files between my PCs.I'd tried Netgear, D-Link and Linksys and was sorely disappointed by the limited ranges on those AP/router units. Netgear was the worst. Finally I decided to give this a try. I was a little skeptical at first since I wasn't excited about a Microsoft product. Plain and buggy," I thought. But, five minutes after installation, I finally got steady wi-fi signal all over my house, whereas before with the other AP/routers the signal would drop completely after less than 20 feet. It has worked well ever since. Very happy with it.There's a twenty-dol rebate until June 30. But you'll have to dig for the rebate form on Microsoft's online store site."
