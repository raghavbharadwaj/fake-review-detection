Sony did a good job with this little player. I've owned it for two years, and this is what I think about it.CD Player - 4 It works well. The only problem I've had is it would take a while to read CDs (especially MP3s).Radio - 5 Crystal clear sound. Actually, I live about 15 miles away from metro Tucson, so this little player does a great job as far as reception goes.Tape - 4 I do give it credit for it's sound. The recording, hmm... I wish it could record stuff you said into it.Equalizer/Bass Boost - 5 It's does a great job controling bass and treble. No compliants.Sleep - ? Never used it yet.Ease Of Use/Design - 3 Have to say, it's ease of use is good. It's design different story. Even looking at it from amazon.com, it looks hard to use.Overall - 4.2 It's a good little player. The price is a little high, but it's all worth it.
