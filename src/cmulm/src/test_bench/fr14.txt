This is made of 100% pure coconut oil- no fillers in it. It has a long shelf life and since it's a 16 oz. bottle, you'll have it for a long time. Coconut oil is so versatile, it can be used from hair serum to bug repellant to massages. I like to use this oil for my hair. It gives my hair shine and leaves it soft and smooth. I can either use it alone or mix it with my other hair care products ( I especially like to mix it with my conditioner). I've used it on my skin (arms and legs). I like the way it leaves my skin feeling. It's not greasy and absorbs quickly. My son and daughter both have dry skin and I also use this oil to massage and moisturize their skin. Radha Beauty's Fractionated Coconut Oil is an all-in-one multipurpose oil that's also a great product.
