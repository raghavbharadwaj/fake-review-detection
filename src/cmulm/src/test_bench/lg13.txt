Best TV I've ever bought (and I've bought my fair share). Currently using this as bedroom TV/monitor for an Asus Chromebox. Picture is beautiful out of the box. Think all I changed was the backlight, and I'm typically obsessive about settings. No dead pixels, no significant bleed, great contrast, great reproduction, no noticeable artifacts or ghosting. Perfect.The 32" is compact, easily moved around and has a cool "feet" style stand, which I like. Sound is quite good as others have said (10 watts + 10 watts is above par for sure) but certainly not soundbar quality. I'm fine with the stock audio as a bedroom set but if you're buying one of the larger sizes as a living area TV or centerpiece for a home theater don't expect the on board speakers to supplant a proper system. But if you're generally fine with TV speakers as they are these will be a welcome improvement.You get what you pay for plus about 100% with this set. Most models these days are trying to capitalize on "smart" features which are little more than what a Roku could do five years ago. If you want apps, internet or anything else buy a high quality TV (like this) with none of the junk, then connect your choice of device (I recommend ChromeBox).If you want a 32" 1080P and this is in your price range buy it. Don't hesitate and buy the no-name. Buy this one....and from what I've read the 39 and 42 are also quite nice.Overall a spectacular deal.
