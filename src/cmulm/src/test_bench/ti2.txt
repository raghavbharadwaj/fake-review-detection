I have had the Timex Women's watch for many years. I like it because the numbers are easy to read, it gives me the date and I like that it lights up in the dark. When the battery dies, I buy a new watch because by this time the leather band is also worn out ( I can't wear a stainless steel band because of allergies) and it costs about the same as replacing them. I prefer this watch to the more expensive watches I own.
