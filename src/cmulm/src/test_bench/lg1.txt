The first TV I received came with a broken screen. But, amazon within 48 hours had a new replacement; excellent! Now, regarding the TV, I read the reviews and how stunning the image and sound was suppose to be. Let me tell you, that is NOT an exaggeration. The picture image is amazing. As far as the sound, it is not like a surround system. But, for a TV this is as close as it can get especially when it is heard under "Cinema." I am super happy with this purchase and definitely would recommend to buy. If anything changes within the next year I will certainly update my review. For now, it is EXCELLENT!
