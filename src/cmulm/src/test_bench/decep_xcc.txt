This is a crazy price. Less than two bucks. If you have any iPod with dock connector, or an iPhone, this will charge it in your car. Just plug the big part into your cigarette lighter, and then connect the firewire to dock cable (also included), to your iPod or iPhone! Perfect. Buy one for every car at this price. I did!While iPods dropped Firewire syncing several years ago, you can still charge by firewire connection, and that is what this does. No issue at all.I'd review the item further, but there isn't much else to say. It's great. It even comes in pretty nice packaging, from Griffin. They make nice products.
