I really loved the product. It has all the required functionalities required in a student's daily need. It has good enough processing speed as well as all other functionalities which enable seamless video and audio playback. Though it is not comparable to the high end models of other brands, still it offers a lot of value for the amount paid. I would like to recommend this product if you are looking for something having basic configurations at an average cost. Amazing guitar. Feels so easy to play. Value for money. Would definitely rate 10 on 10 for this. Liked it a lot. The Volume and Sound quality of it is so gr8.
