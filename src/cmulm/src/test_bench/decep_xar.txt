I have a 64MB SD card by Panasonic which came with my Panasonic AV-10 e-wear gadget as well as a 128MB also from Panasonic, and both have proven totally reliable. I stuff the 128MB with WMA music and use it in my iPaq 1910, and because I'm a clumsy guy I dropped the card a few times, but there are no file errors and the read and write speeds are excellent. I trust Panasonic and also Lexar flash cards. As Panasonic SD cards have come down in price -- now even cheaper than Lexar and Sandisk -- I'm getting the 256MB so I can store more video clips on my AV-10 multi-AV device.
