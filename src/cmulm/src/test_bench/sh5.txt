We have a dog and a cat and therefore a ton of pet hair. We have hardwoods area rugs and one room that is wall to wall carpeting. We have been battling dog smell in the house for a while despite frequent cleaning air fresheners and vacuuming and I suspected part of the blame was pet hair. When our old vacuum died I read a lot of reviews before selecting this. When I took it out of the box it looked kind of flimsy. My husband even commented it looked cheap compared to our old one. However this thing sucked up a ton of dirt pet hair etc. Literally I vaccuum one room and the container is full of yuck (and it is not a small container). You can feel it sucking onto the floor. Hope it holds up- so far so good!
