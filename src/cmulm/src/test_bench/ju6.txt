Being a child of the 80's I grew up watching the Superfriends after school & on Saturday mornings. As an adult, I like this updated version, because it is more adult oriented with better storylines. In addition, it does more than feature just a handful of characters. Yes you have the usual big names, (Superman, Green Lantern, Batman), but others only die-hard fanboys would know (Hawk & Dove &Atom-Smasher for example).Bottom line, great introduction for newbies, or die-hard fans.
