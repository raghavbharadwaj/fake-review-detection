I'm so glad I shopped around for these cables. If I had bought them at a local electronics big box" store, I would have spent more than five times as much for exactly the same result. There's no reason to spent megabucks on a short digital cable like this.Works great from my FIOS TV box to my Toshiba HDTV, recommended to all."
