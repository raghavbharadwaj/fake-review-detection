If you live in a high-risk neighborhood like mine, you can't risk getting caught on the street without a knife.  This ""XOX"" folding knife has saved my skin on more than one occasion, and put several of my opponents in the hospital.  The 4.75 inch blades are long enough to put your adversary out of commission, but too short to actually kill someone (unless you or they are very unlucky), thereby protecting you from protracted incarceration (or worse, in Texas and Florida).
