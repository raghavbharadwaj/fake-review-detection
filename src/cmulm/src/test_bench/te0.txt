Bought a new toy hauler, so I needed a brake control unit. Other family members use Tekonsha brake controllers and swear by them, so I bought this unit. Don't need all the bells and whistles this one offers with just one trailer, but I know I have the ability to pull more trailers with it if need be without a lot of fuss. Can't comment on setup and installation and the RV dealer did that for me as part of the toy hauler purchase. It does work very well though and has quite a bit of adjustment from what I saw. It is easy to read so you can see that it is working and how much braking pressure is being applied to the trailer brakes. That has proved valuable at least once, because there was once when my trailer plug was not all the way plugged in. I noticed the display was not reading out brake pressure as I applied the brakes. Reconnect the trailer plug and all was well. Would have never known that connector was not all the way plugged in (and thus, not trailer brakes) on a brake controller that does not have a display.
