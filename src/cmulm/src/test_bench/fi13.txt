I know these books get a bad wrap, but I loved them! They were just what I needed to get excited about my husband again. Most of the kink really isn't that bad. I already own Ben Wa balls, a sleeping mask, a swing, etc. etc. so the stuff in these books didn't seem too bad. I'm not into all that whipping and stuff, so I'm glad it didn't go into all of that. But really I think this is a story about redemption--- because Christian really makes a turn for the better By  the end of book 3. Like I said, I loved themAnd yes, I would say that I'm Christian Grey obsessed. But I'm also "MY Husband" obsessed.
