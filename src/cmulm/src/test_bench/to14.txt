Have had this for a couple of years now, I think - my favorite toaster in the world.Toast should be easy, right? Then why to so many toasters fail to make decent toast?Or make it hard to get things like English muffins out?This toaster makes excellent toast, bagels, and English muffins, and it makes you feel pampered while it does it.Insert toast, select darkness (usually 3 or 4, depending upon density of bread), push button and watch it descend while the side grids slide into place to stabilize the bread in the center of the slot. Bars tick down the time remaining, and when it's done, beep, the grids pull away and the toast rises, reachable without fork or tongs. What could be more perfect? A machine that makes something you like, consistently, with style and grace.
