I upgraded from a 50D and am extremely happy with my purchase. I actually had a 7D Mark II on preorder, but decided to cancel that and go with the 6D after reading and watching many reviews online. Even though the 7D Mark II looks like it's a great piece of equipment, I'm went with the 6D.While I have nothing against crop-body cameras (my 50D isn't going anywhere), I knew that I wanted to make the jump to full frame. Since I already have a decent collection of Canon lenses, I had no intention to switch brands (we use Nikon where I work and they are fine cameras, but I prefer Canon).The well-known small number of autofocus points is what initially made me shy away from the 6D, but so far it hasn't caused any problems with my photography. I've managed to take some great pictures in many different settings (kid's soccer, hikes, birds, portraits, etc). I would never suggest this camera to someone who mainly shoots quick action, but with the right lens and technique you can get some pretty good images if you know what you're doing with this camera.Unless you plan on waiting around for the the 6D Mark II (if they're even going to make one) or plan on forking over the cash for the 5D Mark III or it's eventual replacement, I don't think you'll be disappointed with buying this camera if you understand it's limitations.Pros:- Great image quality- Impressive high ISO performace- Video capabilities (although I mainly shoot photos)- WI/Fi/GPS capabilities (I didn't think I'd use these, but I find them very useful)- LightweightCons- Auto-focus system outdated- Camera options not up to par considering it's a fairly expensive full-frame camera (get Magic Lantern to make up for it)- Doesn't appear to be put together nearly as well as other Canon crop cameras (50D included!)- Low FPSIf you don't need 64 autofocus points and are looking to jump into full frame with Canon and don't want to spend a fortune doing so, this is the camera for you. It isn't perfect, but it works for me! I also purchased the 24-105 lens and am satisfied with that as well.
