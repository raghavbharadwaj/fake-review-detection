I really love this keyboard. Not only is it very comfortable for a touch-typist, but, unlike most other Microsoft keyboards, it puts where the keys belong. For example, the Insert/Delete/Home/End/PageUp/PageDown are exactly where they should be and where you expect them to be, unlike with many recent Microsoft and Logitech keyboards. The backspace key is large - in fact that's why I chose this keyboard over many other potential choices. You can also use this keyboard with a USB port or the good old PS/2 port, so it's flexible. The build quality is good, too. You don't need to install any driver to use this keyboard, but if you do you get additional functionalities with tose extra multimedia" keys at the top (which I don't care for)."
