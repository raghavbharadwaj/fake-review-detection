I mostly use the Canon 6D for astrophotograpy and Milky Way video time-lapse. I have gotten the best images of the Andromeda and the Triangulum galaxies with this camera. For broadband targets its hard to beat; providing you have a good dark site to work in. I've done planetary work with it as well and a time-lapse of the recent total lunar eclipse, loaded into a Celestron Edge 8. The results were amazing. And keep in mind I have a SBIG STF8300 mono astro cam but prefer this for broadband work. For narrowband work, however, it's no contest. The STF 8300 is the clear winner. But that's not what a Canon 6D was made for so don't expect it to do narrowband filter work. Gotta love a full frame sensor.
