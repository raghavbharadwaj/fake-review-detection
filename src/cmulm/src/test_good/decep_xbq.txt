The Amazon product description is erroneous. This 4-in-1 PC Card adapter for flash memory cards can do Secure Digital (SD), Multimedia Card (MMC), MemoryStick (MS), and the older SmartMedia cards, but not the larger CompactFlash (CF) card. I have yet to find a PC Card adapter that can do both SD and CF formats.Otherwise this is a good, solid adapter which turns your flash memory card into an external drive on a laptop PC. Just insert the flash memory card into the adapter, then plug the adapter into your laptop, presto! the memory card appears in your My Computer or Windows Explorer as an external removable disk, and you can do all the copying and moving you want.
