TDK manufactures excellent 120 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 120 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 60 blank minutes for recording on each side. This is useful when recording one hour talk shows, for example.If you pay the Amazon price of $8.90 for the ten-pack you spend only 89 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a TDK cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a TDK cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK normal bias 120 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.
