This toaster makes my family ridiculously happy. I know it's just a lowly kitchen appliance, but it's the first toaster that we've had that actually toasts bread properly--no burnt spots, even toasting, quick, and easy to use. We've toasted bagels (both refrigerated and Panera), English muffins (the fat Wolferman's and regular store bought), and of course bread (thin rye and wide loaf wheat) and not once has this toaster ruined them.The mechanical lowering and raising of the toast is totally delightful. I sincerely hope that this toaster continues to work this well after we've owned it for a year.
