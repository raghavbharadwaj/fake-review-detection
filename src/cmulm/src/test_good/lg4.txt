I am a college student and I was in need of 1080p goodness! I do not make a lot of money and I was going to wait until black friday to find me a steal but I could not wait any longer. This tv literally called out to me, I got the 39 - inch tv which is a really good size for a small/medium room, at a great value. All I needed was a screwdriver and 2 minutes of my time to place the mounts on the tv. I have to say that the tv itself looks really good, it goes well with whatever decor you have, its slick and silver and overall pricey looking. As soon as I turned it on the screen was a huge change from the gigantic sony tv I had. The screen was good from the start but after the adjustments and HDMI's being plugged in, it had a better superb quality than my friends Samsung 45 inch tv which he paid double the amount than I did for this tv. I was amazed! Everything is so crisp and clear and beautiful, provided that you are using an HDMI to get the full 1080p quality. The sound is so LOUD! I keep finding my self turning it down. NOTE: This tv does not have smart features, I did not need "smart" features because my ps3 provides bluray, netflix, much more. If you do not own a console it would be smart to buy a chromecast which has the same things as a smart feature but without spending hundreds more. Also I would suggest buying HDMI cables you can find really cheap ones here on amazon!So I really recommend this tv if you want great quality, sound and presentation from a tv without spending more than you need to.
