I got the EN-EL3a as a free replacement for the recalled EN-EL3 battery. (Check Nikonusa dot com to see if your EN-EL3 has been recalled.) It's perfect for my D70 -- and as another reviewer has pointed out, it gives you slightly more power juice -- about 7% more. If you are looking to buy an official Nikon battery this is a good value. BTW you can find generic brands (also here on Amazon.com) for about $20. I'm not saying whether you should buy a Nikon or a generic OEM one. After all, Nikon screwed up with the EN-EL3 so I can't vouch for their safety.Like the original EN-EL3 this is likely to be made in China.
