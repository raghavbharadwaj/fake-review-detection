This is a standard-issue MiniDV digital camcorder in a very stylish body. While not one of the small pocket-size types -- incidentally those are often awkward to operate and susceptible to hand shakes -- the GRD30 is still small enough to be highly portable. All the standard features of a digital camcorder, from digital tape to fold-out LCD screen to IEEE 1394 Firewire" connections, are there, and JVC also claims superb video image quality. The 16x optical zoom is higher than many other camcorders. (When choosing a camcorder or digital camera, pay ZERO attention to digital zoom claims, since digital zoom is entirely useless. Only optical zoom power counts.)An attractive price, especially here on Amazon.com, makes this a top buy."
