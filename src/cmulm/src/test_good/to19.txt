I replaced on old slow toaster with the Cuisinart CPT-420 and it was one of the best choices ever. The toast or bagels turn out perfect every time. I love that you can see the progress on the screen to know just when the toast will be done. Yes, I admit the automatic down feature isn't necessary but it is really cool! The toaster is not too large and pretty enough to keep on the counter when company is over. It might take a few times to get YOUR setting just right but once you do the toast is perfect every time - what more could you ask for.
