I bought a BN-01 before going on a two week cruise and left the charger at home which gave me 2 BN-01's, an FL-50 and FC-01 to support off of my SHV-01 and a set of 4 nicads. Keeping the nicads charged and using the BN-01 / SHV-01 on every shot together they gave me 2000 indoor flash shoots (with very rapid shooting). Had I not used a set of 4 NIMH cells along side the BN-01's I suspect the number would be lower, around 700 shots per battery.EDIT 9-12-2009 I'm on my 3rd BN-01 - 1 came with my SHV-01 and is now pretty dead, I bought one separately a couple years ago and it's about 1/2 dead (300 flashes) and so I bought another one for this trip. I was glad to see it was a fresh stock battery so I won't ding it a star but it is pricy for 6 2400 mah nimh cells and a fuel gauge. The only way to really tell if your pack is still good is to charge it then leave the SHV-01 turned on w/o a flash connected. It should drain the pack in about 30 hours without use. If it goes dead in 3 hours - then its time to replace the BN-01 -- END OF EDITEither way the BN-01 is a 6 cell (7.2 Volt) NiMH battery rated at 2.4 AH. The combination really charges your flash fast!
