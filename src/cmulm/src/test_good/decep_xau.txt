Over time it becomes harder to quickly purchase replacement cartridges. If you bought a used printer you can refer to another HP printer manual for general advice. HP advises against refilling a cartridge but you may find doing this useful.The HP840C User's Guide has a Table of Contents that covers the topics in its 74 pages. Be sure to read the warnings in the manual about proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. One user had a problem with the separate power supply.
