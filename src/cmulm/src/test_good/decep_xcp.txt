I've personally verified this: this 256MB Memory Stick PRO Duo works in the Sony PSP as well as in the latest Sony digital cameras and camcorders. It's very fast in speed and very reliable. Just handle it with care as it's tiny and thin.Now, in order to play copy-protected digital content you buy from Sony's Connect music store, you'll need to install the latest PSP firmware update. The initial firmware (v1.00) did not support MagicGate digital rights management.For ultimate performance and reliability when it comes to Memory Stick Duo cards, I recommend Sony. There are too many reports of reliability issues with Sandisk cards.
