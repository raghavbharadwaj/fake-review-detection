This is a great cable to have in your box. Everywhere we find the 3.5mm 1/8 stereo jack and interfacing it to XLR is always important. This is a stereo cable so the tip and ring go to the two different xlrs with a common shield to the cold terminal on the xlr. I'm using it to get analog audio from my pc's audio out jack into my XLR recorder (marantz pmd-661)Marantz PMD661 Portable SD Recorderwhich has a line level input on the xlr's. I can also adapt xlr mics to pc's mic in with xlr adapter cables.My PC motheboard has 6 3.5mm TRS jacks from the audio chip out the back, plus an optical connection, which is the order I made with this cable. I also got a 6' lightguide cable and a converter to RCA digital audio for my recorder which now gives me a number of options to link the two.I've come to trust HOSA cables and these are no let down."
