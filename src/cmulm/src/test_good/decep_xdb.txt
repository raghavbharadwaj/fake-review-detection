This is a pretty good printer. My favorite thing about it is that it is very convientent. It is a copier, scanner, and printer all in one.The printing jobs on it are pretty fast, though I wish the copier was a bit faster (especially color, took about 2 minutes). Though, overall, I was impressed with the print speed. Only took seconds for a full black text page.The printer did not come with a USB cable, which had me pay an extra $20 for it. Though, that was a 2.1 speed USB, so it was supposed to be expensive.Not many paper jams, though there were one or two times the paper had to catch itself, though the printer was good at that.mponamoabI have used the scanner, which is handy-dandy, but I do have a digital camera (DSC-P73), so I rarely used this future. Though, at the spur of the moment...The price for this was very good for this. I only paid $100 for it, which was cool.Overall, I highly recommend this printer. It was a great deal.
