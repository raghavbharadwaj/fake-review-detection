Sony makes two 1GB Memory Stick PRO Duo cards. The one on this page is MSX-M1GN and it's labeled High Speed," meaning it reads and writes using parallel connectors. The Sony PSP, among other Sony gadgets, supports this high-speed access technology, so you can use this card in the PSP.But you don't really need the extra high speed. Instead, you can save money by buying the other Sony 1GB card, model MSX-M1GS (notice difference in the last letter), which is a "non-high speed" 1GB Memory Stick Duo. Both cards support MagicGate, Sony's digital rights management technology. (Sony's Connect online music store requires a MagicGate-compatible storage card.)Let me emphasize my previous point: you don't need the "high speed" Memory Stick Duo, the regular Memory Stick Duo is fast enough for games, movies and music on the PSP. Paying extra for this "high speed" version (~$40 over the "S" version) if you only use it in the PSP is a waste of money since the PSP doesn't really take advantage of the parallel access technology -- i.e., it plays cool with the technology, but doesn't employ it. On the other hand, if you have one of Sony's latest digital cameras that support high-speed continue shooting, you may want to get this.This is a fast, reliable flash memory card that will likely last a long time. I've never had any problems with Sony's flash storage cards."
