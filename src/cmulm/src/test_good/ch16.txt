I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest review. These chalk markers are so awesome I am not the best drawer but I have using these on are doorwall windows and it is fun on nice days to sit outside and draw on the door. These also are so easy to use just tap and shake and use pretty simple. The clean up is also really easy just water and a towel and it comes off. Overall great product.
