These slim and colorful jewel cases by Maxell provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. These jewel cases are actually rather well constructed. They hold together for years at a time and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases measure roughly less than half the width of the older, original jewel cases that seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too. These jewel cases can be storing discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or whatever.Another plus of the fact that these jewel cases come in different colors is that you can color code different types of data discs, CD-Rs, or whatever media you wish. Great added feature--they certainly aren't ugly!Overall, I highly recommend this CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media."
