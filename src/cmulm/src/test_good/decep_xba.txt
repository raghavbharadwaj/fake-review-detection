So far I have 4 of these in 4 ea. 1 year old trucks running optima D31 batteries and inverters inside, along with this isloator model to prevent load on the truck's starting battery. One truck is equipped with dual D31's for extended inverter runtime.With 48 truck-months of usage we've had no failures or trouble of any kind, if you are interested we also wired two trucks with the ability to jumpstart themselves using this (it's rated for 300A surge). It does mean an extra wire and switch inside the cab but beats bringing the jumper cart out in the weather.During the year of use, there have been no more emergency jump starts, no more dead trucks on monday, and the inverter systems have run fine. With the extra current from the alternator we can run the inverters (I'll admit a hodgepodge of models purchased at different times) for extended periods of time as needed to support heavy power tools to cell phone chargers.Drivers do appreciate the clunk" this isolator makes when engaged. The audible noise lets you know the two electrical systems are tied.I would recommend a shunt style ampmeter if room permits."
