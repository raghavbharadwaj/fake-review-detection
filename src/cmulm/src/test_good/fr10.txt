This book is so erotic, your eyes are glued to every page! this is what you call a good read. I enjoyed this book so much until I had to read it again and again to see if I got the same feeling each time. It has excitement in it and adventure. It has drama and danger all rolled into one great book. I really enjoyed reading this book. I am willing to bet the other parts of this trilogy are equally well written. I can't wait to start. Christian Grey is a character to be reckoned with and Anastasia Steele iis a force you were not expecting. You gotta get the book and read, read, read!
