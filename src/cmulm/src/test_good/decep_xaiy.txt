My failure analysis lab does alot of work looking for cracks in failed products. With the dark red filter, digital camera set to b&w;, macro lens, and some stain you can find defects in material quickly then print large sized blowups on a digital printer (e.g. HP designjet). On 11x17 paper or 13x19 they are clear as can be and the new vivera inks from HP customized for b&w; printing make photo output top notch on the right paper. Be sure to have various water based stains on hand to bring out the defect as some work better than others. If one does not work, wash it with DI water and apply another color stain and you will get the message with one color combination.This 52mm filter fits the prime lens from olympusOlympus 50mm f/2.0 Telephoto Macro ED Lens for E1, E300 & E500 Digital SLR Cameraswhich has incredible detail when combined with the tube extender for zooming. It can also show that there is no defect present and direct your work elsewhere.
