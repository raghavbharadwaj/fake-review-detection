This is my third toaster in 18 months (granted the others were garage sale finds), since my dad stole the toaster he bought and took it home. We regularly do bagels (need wide slots and should only toast the inside of the bagel), English muffins (again, only toast 1 side and my daughter likes hers crispy), as well as normal toast. I love the digital display for shade (2 is perfect for bagels), the countdown is great if you're trying to time eggs to be done when toast is, the push button "bagel" - only toast 1 side (which is clearly marked on the top how to load it). The auto/leverless feature is pretty cool, drop my bagels in, check that my daughter didn't change the setting, tap bagel, tap toast and go about my business. Who am I kidding?! I still stand there and watch the toaster countdown. Toasters Anonymous anyone?
