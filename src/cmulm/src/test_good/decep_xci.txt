This complete surround sound system by Onkyo offers terrific, home-theater-quality sound. The speakers themselves look sleek, and they sound the best when you have a receiver that allows &quot;mega bass&quot;. I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw them in a CC store for this price. After admiring the sound for ten minutes, two other customers and I each bought a set. This is one of the best purchases I've made this holiday season.
