I bought a 5D Mark III a few months prior and have been very impressed with the quality. I needed to update my second camera, but purchasing another 5dM3 was just too expensive right now. I read loads of reviews and finally "settled" for the 6D. I quickly realized I did not settle at all, but got quite a wonderful product for a cut of the price. For videos, the 5dM3 may be worth it, but for photography, this 6D works just as well as the 5D. I LOVE it and can hardly tell a difference when shooting. N.b.: This review is for the average photography enthusiast, shooting on the side or as a hobby. Clearly, there are differences between this and the 5d, but for most individuals, the difference is minimal.
