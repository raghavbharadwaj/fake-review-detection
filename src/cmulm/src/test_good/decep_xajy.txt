When I first saw the Apple iPod socks advertise on Apple.com during the Fall of 2004, I knew I had to have them. Wow. Six colors, a non-bulky way to protect my iPod, and did I mention cool?"In fact, I thought the iPod socks would become intoxicatingly popular, and I expected sellouts and the likes. Unfortunately for Apple, although they have a following, the iPod socks do not seem to be on the top of every iPod owner's buying list. However, I love my iPod socks. I slide my click wheel iPod into the sock of my choice, and I can rest knowing that whether it is sitting on my desk, in my pocket, in the car, or on the table, that it won't get scratched or banged around. Furthermore, the many colors give me a choice to fit my mood. I also slide my ear buds and iTrip into a sock, and it keeps those items tidied up. The socks are incredibly soft, and they are just the right thickness. They are thick enough to provide some protection, but they add very little thickness to the iPod, which is nice. I don't like the big bulky cases.Overall, I'm happy I paid $30 for my iPod socks. For me, it is the coolest accessory out there, and it is an official Apple product!"
