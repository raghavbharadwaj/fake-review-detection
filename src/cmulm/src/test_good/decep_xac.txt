I've been using the CS 310 since July 2002 and the experience has been positive. First off, it's totally inadequate as either a digital camera or a video cam." The resolution is just not very high, and in video mode you can shoot for something like 15 seconds. The CS 310 is a webcam, and should be used as such.As a webcam it's better than other products in its class. It offers good light sensitivity, which means it'll give you decent (even though grainy) picture quality even in a dimly lit room. The framerate is very good, unlike most other webcams in this price range. Best of all, it's auto focus and auto exposure, so you don't have to mess around with a focus ring each time you use it.The software driver installed easily on my Windows 2000 PC. It comes with a webcam application that allows you to capture videos and still images to your PC as well as host a webcam site (for a fee). It's easy to use, but I bought the 310 to use with NetMeeting, which is a totally no-hassle operation. If you have Windows XP, you can use the 310 well with Windows Messenger and video-chat with your friends.In short, I've been satisfied with the performance of this economic yet solid webcam, and I recommend it to you."
