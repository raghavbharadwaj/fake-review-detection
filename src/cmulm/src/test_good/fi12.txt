Loved the story line. Others think the book is all about sex and lman controlling a woman But it is so much more. I Love how she stands her ground with him and don't give in just because he is breath taking beautiful and filthy rich. The second book Fifty Shades Darker is even better than the first. I'm on chapter 11 of book 3 Fifty Shades Freed and it is just as good. I can't put it down! If your considering reading this series Please Look past the Sex. Even skim over it if necessary But I promise you won't be disappointed in the over all story. Best I've Read in long time!
