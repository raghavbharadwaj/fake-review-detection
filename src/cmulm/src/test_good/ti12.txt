this is my 3rd one in 10 years--same good watch with what appears to be thesame crummy band--based on my past experience the band will last a year if it doesn't get wet too often. I've had the same experience of other reviewers where the adjustable tab comes off and the end of the band with holes in it frays. I have arthritis in my hands so changing the band is difficult. Some times I can find a replacement band at Target or some such and a nice clerk will help me attach it to the watch.
