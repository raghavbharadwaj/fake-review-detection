Sony CRX-230EE CD-RWThe black bezel Sony CRX-230EE 52x32x52x CD-RW is an example of the best of these hardware units for IDE drives. The jumper on the back selects its connection: Master (connects to the end of the cable), Slave (connects to the middle of the cable), or Cable Select (depends on its connection to the end or middle of the cable). For some older computers you should select M or S for best results. There are standard connections for an IDE cable and power cable and audio cables. The case for this unit is shorter than others so it can be easier to connect cables in some tower computers.The CD-ROM interface is governed by International Standards so there is usually no problem in replacing any unit, even if from another manufacturer. This is quite different from video or audio cards or modems, which require different drivers even if from the same manufacturer.The manual for this unit contains the instructions for its use. There are two hints that can be useful to you. One, disable your anti-virus checker when writing (burning") a CD to prevent any possible interference. Then enable it after the writing ends. Two, select the option that tests writing speeds (if possible) to avoid a problem that may prevent a successful completion. This is important when using an older spare computer which may not allow functioning at the highest speeds."
