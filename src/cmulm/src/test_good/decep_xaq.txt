I bought these batteries because the Sony Cybershot digital camera I have had a hard time accepting alkaline batteries. Come to find out, the digital camera is only compatable with NiMH batteries. I bought these rechargeable batteries and couldn't be happier. It takes a few hours for them to fully charge, but otherwise they're great. They don't run out all the time like alkaline batteries, and even if they do run out, you don't need to waste money buying another pack of AA batteries for $2. Now that doesn't sound like much, but after awhile, it adds up, and rechargeable batteries are cheaper. Also, they seem to last about 10x longer (in my perspective) than AA alkaline batteries do (though some rechargeable batteries aren't that powerful). And now, I can take pictures with my camera, and load them into my computer, or do whatever (some alkaline batteries were so weak that my camera wouldn't even take a picture)! Highly recommended; go get a pair!NOTE: The picture of the product is incorrect. It's actually 2500 mAh, which is a big bargain.
