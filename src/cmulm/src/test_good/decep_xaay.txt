These affordable and slim jewel cases by Memorex provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. Could that be because I'm a 90 pound weakling? SMILE Well, I doubt it--I think these are well constructed. They hold together for years at a time and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases provide excellent storage for media and they measure roughly less than half the width of the older, original jewel cases that seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too. These jewel cases can be storing discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or whatever.They also come in a variety of five colors: red, blue, green, orange and purple, so you can even color code different types of data discs, CD-Rs, or whatever media you wish. Great added feature--they certainly aren't ugly!Overall, I highly recommend this CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. Use these in good health!SMILE"
