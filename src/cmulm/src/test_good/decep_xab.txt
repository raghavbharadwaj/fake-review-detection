I just wanted to let people know that the operating system has a 128 GB limit due to address bits, so even if you buy a 160 GB drive for it, only 128GB will be visable. To change the disk you only need to remove 2 screws - the one under the square silver warantee void sticker (which goes back OK) and its counterpart. The drive cover then slips off, you remove the old drive, install the new one (80,100,120,160 GB but 128 max capacity) and put only those 2 screws back in (don't mess with the two deep screws) - now go to the drive which will have a red NFA on it (Not FormAteed) - menu click on it and click format drive - it takes 30 seconds or so for a 160 to be a 128, and then you have the maximum capacity. With the price of drives dropping, their cheaper model plus a 120GB drive at a discount is a 5 minute swapout, plus you can put the 80 GB into a portable USB drive case. I did this when I first bought my 80 GB with plans to upgrade it when drive prices fell far enough and got 128 instead of 80 GB on my mp3 player / camera dumper / usb2.0 disk.I still think the Wolverine is a great overall product and beats the apple version feature wise (but not thickness wise) - being able to dump my CF cards on vacation to the MP3 player is a significant feature that the pod's dont have.Hope that helps - the drive upgrade is simple, 5 minutes, and needs a Philips #00 screwdriver to complete.
