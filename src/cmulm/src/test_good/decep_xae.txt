I got the camera by accident but have been very happy with it. Granted 2 megapixels is not a lot these days, but is adequate for most everyday photos, and you can print good 6&quot; by 4&quot; prints. (I use an Epson inkjet printer and the results are very gratifying.) The image quality exceeded my expectations. As with other Fuji products, it's well made and packaged.
