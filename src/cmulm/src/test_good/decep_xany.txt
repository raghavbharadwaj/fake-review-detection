This Toshiba has a retro Leica look and with 4 megapixels it's also a powerful digital camera. 2.8x optical zoom gives you about 28-80mm in 35mm equivalent. Pretty easy to use and good build quality. Definitely use NiMH batteries -- but in any case I prefer these to LiIon because the latter are [spendier] and lose capacity after ~300 cycles. NiMH can be charged 1000 times before they degrade! Do carry extra sets of batteries.
What I like about this product:-- Excellent, top-notch sound output, both through a good set of headphones and through the two analog output jacks in the back of the unit-- Can play WMA format in addition to MP3-- Firewire interface included-- Good battery life: I get about 9 hours, less than the 11 claimed by Creative, but still good-- Ability to add a 2nd battery-- Optical/analog input jack for recordings-- 20GB at an attractive priceWhat I don't like:-- Still too big and too heavy, esp. compared to the 20GB Apple iPod. The iPod uses Toshiba's PC card hard disk, which is much smaller and quieter than the Fujitsu 2.5-inch disk used by Jukebox 3-- Uninspiring styling-- Lacks driver to allow Windows to recognize the device as an external drive. Archos gets A+ for getting this right: all Archos MP3 players can be used as an external drive, plug-n-go. Jukebox 3, in contrast, only comes with a clumsy file transfer tool, unless you buy the commerical third-party software Nomad ExplorerConclusion:A very good value considering it has 20GB of space which allows up to 8000 songs and can be used as external storage (if you can live with the awkward file transfer program). Still too big for the pocket, though.
