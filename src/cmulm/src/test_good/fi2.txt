I really did not want to read this book. I hate reading the books that are all the hype. And to be honest sex scenes have never been my favorite part of books. I read this book because the movie was coming out and my best friend wanted to see the movie and I would go for her. I also have this personal need to read books before seeing the movie. So I read the book. And yes I really did like this book. I really did like the characters. And I really will read the sequels even though I swore I would not because I am curious what becomes of these characters I have embraced. Sigh.
