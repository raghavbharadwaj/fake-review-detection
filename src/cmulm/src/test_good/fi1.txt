I adored this book! Out of the three that make up the trilogy, it's my least favorite. Yet, I cannot deny my fascination towards it. I had already seen the movie when I read the book...and I read it just because I had already read the other two.....and felt that it would make no sense omitting to read the beginning. I know that books are always better than the movie....yet this time, having read it afterwards I cannot explain how enlightening it was to read it. There are so many details to Christian and Ana's characters that are important in the other two books and are revealed in this one. I totally recommend reading it!
