If you ever work in a video mixing room, you've no doubt noticed that the paint is black. As a consequence most every piece of equipment is either backlit or has top lighting with a small, flexible light. Those that dont? This is the solution.Drilling a small hole in an out of the way location lets you mount this to the chassis in a professional manner (drill a pilot hole first in metal, then finish off with the actual size needed). The overall small size makes for easy location in even business phones!I use mine with the numark DJ light here on amazonNumark Pro DJ Lightand have replaced the incandescent 12V light with a 12V LED equivalent light in blue to match the room blue-out" conditions. Again, production rooms are lit with white light during setup and blue light during production, so if you want your light not to be noticed during operation, it had better be blue. This is also why blue lettering is not used on mixers - it wouldn't show up under blue light!You can add a rehostat to the incandescent bulb if you don't want to go LED and change color - this lets you drop the voltage so the light is not as bright.Either way this part can add a professional appearance to equipment that didn't come with a light jack (most dont it seems) and you can coordinate all your equipment once you go blue for production.Naturally, being BNC it can be used for other signal purposes, but the 12V power outlet for lighting is one that is so often forgotten even when space is available for it."
