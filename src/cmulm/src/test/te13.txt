I've never owned a brake controller before. I searched through the reviews on Amazon to find the best value for the money. I installed this on my truck and used it a couple of times already. I can't compare this to other controllers because I have no prior knowledge. I can say that this controller works phenomenally well with my dual axle 13,500lb equipment trailer, I like the adjustability and programming presets for different loads and trailers, although I haven't had to use them yet. It worked great right off the bat with the default settings empty and loaded. I'm very impressed with this unit. I think it was worth the extra few bucks compared to lesser models.
