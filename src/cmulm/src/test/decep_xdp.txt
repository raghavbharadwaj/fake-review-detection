Bought this progressive scan DVD player six months ago at Radio Shack and have been very happy with it.Pros:+ Very small footprint and lightweight+ Plays lots of formats and can even play scratched discs without hiccups+ Progressive scan output via component output gives high-quality video+ Haven't had any problems whatsoeverCon:- Typically poorly designed remote control and user's manualI highly recommend this DVD player, esp. as you get progressive scan capability for such a nice price.
