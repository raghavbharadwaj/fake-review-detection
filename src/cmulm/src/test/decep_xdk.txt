Using this with the 50mm 2.0 lens and the ring flash gives an excellent picture of the fine details - down to a postage stamp. 8 Megapixels spread over that small area (4/3 ) is a very high magnification. I use this with the 50mm f/2.0 lens to get very large photos of small objects (macro) - it's a good combination. I did try it for kicks with my 50-200 mm lens and found the lens had to be set to 200mm to get any focus success, which happened around 3-4 feet from the lens. That combination covered an area about the size of a credit card.As the warnings state - you are going to be getting the lens close. Normally I snap on the ring flash anyways so it bumps before the lens filter does, but more than once I've looked around and said "wow - I'm right up on it" - note the support ring for the 50mm f/2.0 lens is a good protector even if you don't have the ring/twin flash yet. it will keep your lens protected inside the steel support as it focuses out.It's best combined with the 50mm F2.0 but it does give you some close in ability with other lenses too. With the 50mm F 2.0 you are close to 1:1 in the image path to sensor. You'll find in the image file if you take a shot of your address on your utility bill that it shows extra specs of toner that dropped around the characters and got fused into the paper. You probably didn't even see them with the naked eye. Great for looking at small defects or combined with the 14-54 or 50-200 you can get a bigger image area.Remember the lens is no longer bringing the image to focus at the sensor so distances are out of proportion. On the bright side no light loss! It's a great magnifier without any lens defects from a manification screw on filter."
