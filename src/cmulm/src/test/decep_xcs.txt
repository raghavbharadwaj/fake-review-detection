Lexar definitely makes the most reliable flash memory cards on the market. They are not as aggressive as Sandisk in marketing speed or as lowballing as PNY or Kingston (two brands definitely NOT to buy). But they are reliable. You can put them through X-ray machine a million times and Lexar cards will survive.This low-priced 2GB SD card is good for most digital camera users; you won't notice any delay. The only times when its non-super-fast speed raises its ugly head is when you try to shoot continuously. You simply won't be able to continuous-shoot at your camera's advertised speed. My estimate is teh fastest you can do is about 2 shots every 3 seconds; your mileage may vary because each camera has a different size of cache buffer (as well as write circuit). Again, the performance bottom line is: if you just take pictures one at a time, you won't have any problems with this card. Most movie mode captures are totally fine, too.Of course, if you buy a higher speed card, not only can you shoot continuously, but you'll also experience slightly faster transfer speeds when connected to Windows. This is esp. true if you transfer large files (e.g., a 3-minute movie file from your camera). So if you shoot a lot of movies in your digital camera, you might also want to consider investing in a faster card (which will likely cost over $110 at this time).Finally, I'd like to give out a bit of advice: always have at least two flash cards with you. Never put all your eggs in one basket." Flash cards are delicate things and they *can* break, even if they are something as reliable as Lexar cards. So, for the same money, it's better to have two 1GB cards rather than one 2GB card. I speak from personal experience -- Murphy's Law has struck me way too many times."
