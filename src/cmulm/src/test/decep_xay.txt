There is nothing wrong with this iPod Shuffle. However, as time has worn on, it's simply less exciting.It wasn't actually updated on the September 2008 update, but some additional colors were added including this sharp blue.Overall, the Shuffle still works great. You sync some of your favorite music to it, and then listen in order, or choose to shuffle it. I must admit that mine sits on my desk and isn't used very often, but it's still nice to have, for its amazingly small size and light weight. Some like having an extra small device for traveling, but I find the Nano and Touch to be perfectly small enough, and the Nano starts at 149.If you want to save the money, and you just want to get some music out of iTunes onto a device, this will do it for you at a really great value. No problems. Also, perhaps you want it as a second iPod, another fine option. However, if you are getting your first iPod, and you do not mind the cost of an entry-level Nano, you'll enjoy being able to find your music on the display.The Shuffle has its place and gets the job done, but it's just not as exciting as the other iPods, nor is always having your playlist blind," always convenient."
