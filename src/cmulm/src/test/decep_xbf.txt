These bookshelf speakers by Sony are an outstanding value for the money! I don't think you can get better value in this price range. The two speakers arrived well packed in protective styrofoam and more; and setup was a breeze using 16 gauge speaker wire.The quality of the sound is really very good. Of course you can get better sound from other speakers, but you'll pay more for that luxury. These suit my needs very well; I wanted a relatively affordable stereo system in my bedroom, not a particularly large space, and when set apart from each other by several feet I can enjoy the best sound possible from these speakers.One thing to note that some have mentioned before--these are 20 inches tall; they really don't look like bookshelf speakers to me! I suppose they would fit in a large wall unit or on a shelf but they can just as well stand on the floor.Highly recommended!
