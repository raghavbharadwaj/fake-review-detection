The Compaq IJ300 inkjet printer was designed for the home or small office. It was manufactured by Lexmark and uses the #70 black and #80 tricolor cartridges. It requires an IEEE 1284 compliant parallel cable to work with Windows XP, Me, 98, and 95. You can download the software and run it to install support in Windows Me, 98, and 95. I used the Add Hardware" function in the "Control Panel" to install this printer in Windows XP. There is software so you can use this printer with Windows 3.1x. Your parallel port must be defined as "ECP". This printer will work when connected to an IOMEGA ZIP 100 drive parallel port.The #70 black cartridge was used for many printers and is readily available in many stores. There are standard procedures for the proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. Refilled cartridges may have a plastic cradle for the same function. If you remove the cartridges you must store them in an air-tight container. Replacement cartridges are always in an air-tight container.One feature of the Compaq IJ300 software (SP10493.exe) is the announcement when printing starts and ends. There is also a display of the estimate of remaining ink left in the cartridge. This may be inaccurate if you begin with a partially used cartridge (as from another printer)."
