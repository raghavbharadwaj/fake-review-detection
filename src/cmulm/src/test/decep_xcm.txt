I just ran a complete analysis of all the flash cards in the Amazon catalog by downloading the information via a script, then parsing the product title to obtain the capacity information, then took the Amazon selling price and divided it by the number of megabytes in the card and this card was the least expensive 4GB card.It's price per megabyte as of July 15,2006 was: 0.0264975 compared to an average price per megabyte for the entire catalog of .96 and an average price per megabyte of 4GB cards of .047.Why does this card only have a sales rank of 7,074 and yet the SanDisk 4GB card has a sales rank of 135? I don't know. But I can tell you it isn't price. ;-)
