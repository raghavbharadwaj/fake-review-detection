It may seem odd but I bought this for my wife on Valentine's Day and it was one of her favorite Valentine's Day gifts ever. It happens after 30 years. It might have helped that 1) I saw her looking at toasters in Target, 2) I gave her roses and took her to dinner too. The latter cost as much as the toaster, but it's the toaster she still raves about.Everyone who sees it is interested and impressed. It's everything the product description says and it makes good toast and frozen waffles too.KNOW THIS!1. It takes about 20 times toasting empty on the max setting of '7' to remove the new metal smell & taste. Maybe it only takes 10, but after I tasted it the first time I didn't try again until 20 burn-ins. I called customer support and they said to use it on the max setting about 10-15 times with no bread.2. After the 20x of toasting without toast... it takes a little experimenting to find the toasting level you like, and one number-level makes a significant difference.3. Don't forget the 'Reheat' button. Nice.We are very happy with this toaster!
