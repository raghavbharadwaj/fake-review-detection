After using an annoying fuzzy and crackling Belkin Tunecast, I went out to find a cassette adapter for my iRiver player. I bought this one since it was made by Sony and it was fairly cheap.As far as sound goes, it's very good. Unfortunately, there is a buzzing sound during music. I've found that raising the player's volume instead of the cassette player's makes the buzz go away at higher volumes. At low volumes, unfortunately, there will be a noticeable buzz (especially when wearing headphones). However, for the price, the sound is just right as far as the output. Decent bass, good treble, nice mids, it barely (if at all) makes changes in the sound of the player's output.As far as durability, seems to be up to par from most generic cassette adapters. I'm sure it will last awhile, however a lot of the reviewers have been complaining about it only lasting a few months, so be careful.The price is pretty good, but shame on Target as I bought it there for $19.99 and the price on their website is $13.49.Overall, as long as your not too picky, and you get it around the list price, you should definitely be satisfied.
