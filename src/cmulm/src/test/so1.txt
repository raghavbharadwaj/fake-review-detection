These things won't be winning any huge awards, but they are a great set of cans for a very low price-point. They have extremely crisp highs, and they are much more efficient than my other headphones. (The same volume setting on both headphones, these are louder)They do a great job at noise-cancellation, even though the audio bladder switch on the side does nearly nothing. I was listening to light music, and I couldn't even hear my surround sound playing loud gunfire and chainsaw noises (GoW) right in front/behind me!All in all, these headphones are spectacular, and are an excellent value for your dollar.My only con, is that they don't have the best bass in the world - so I'd consider these a "classical/electronica" set of headphones. What I mean is that these aren't going to be rumbling your eardrums out of your head. They have a very well-rounded sound spectrum, and do not feel tinny at all. It just won't reach those deep depths of rumbling. It's not that much of a downside, really - it's just the nature of the beast.
