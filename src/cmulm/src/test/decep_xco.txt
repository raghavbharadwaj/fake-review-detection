My friend had one of these and he was real happy with it, which prompted me to get one as well. (A rebate helped, too.) It's been four weeks and I'm quite happy with this no-frills laser printer. High quality build, and fast! The print quality is comparable to the HP Laserjet 4100 in my office. Loading paper takes a bit getting used to, but if you are familiar with inkjet's, I don't think this is a problem. I use the printer with Windows XP and the software options work great. I don't print that much, but I think this is designed for moderate printing in a home or SOHO. If you run XP, you can also set up XP's network printing so you can print to this printer from any PC in the house/office.
