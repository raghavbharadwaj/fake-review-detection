I tried quite a few 802.11g PC Cards and found the Netgear WG511 to be the best, in terms of both range/reception and setup. I was able to install and use the WG511 in five different laptops (running Win2k or WinXP) without a hitch. I'm also getting very good reception from my 802.11b AP, whereas other PC Card clients had trouble maintaining the connection. Overall I'm real happy with this one.One note of caution: WEP, the encryption used by 802.11b, is not secure! I wouldn't use an e-mail client like Eudora or Outlook or anything that might expose my passwords, without using application-level encryption (e.g., encrypted log-in in Outlook).
