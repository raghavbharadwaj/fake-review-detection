The above words have been uttered by my husband several times since we bought this toaster. I almost didn't buy it because this is our second Cuisinart. The first was a 4 slicer we bought from Costco and it was a piece of junk. So I guess with toasters one model number does work better than another even when made by the same company. Personally I don't care if my bread is toasted unevenly but it's a very big deal with my husband. So when he says gosh, that toaster works good, you can take that to the bank.
