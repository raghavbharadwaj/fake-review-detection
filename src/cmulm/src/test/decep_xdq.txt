for a long time we have had some color standards. blue meant analog 15 pin d sub 9 vga, white meant digital dvi, black was anyones guess as to how the ends were wired, etc.This complies with the white = dvi digital rule. It works great on my evga 590 cardEVGA GeForce GTX 590 Classified 3072 MB GDDR5 PCI Express 2.0 3DVI/Mini-Display Port SLI Ready Limited Lifetime Warranty Graphics Card, 03G-P3-1596-ARto hookup to one of my 4 monitors (the 590 has a display port and 3x dvi connectors on its dual housing)Strange though that if you leave the 6 foot size the colors change - I wish they would keep white/white when making a dvi to dvi cable. that's a personal nitpick - nothing wrong with cables to go - I just like white to identify DVI.
