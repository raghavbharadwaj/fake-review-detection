The Creative Nomad Zen Xtra MP3 Jukebox is actually an amazing MP3 player, if you can forgive its relatively large size (when compared to the iPod) and clunky user interface (again, when compared to the iPod). Not only does it have SUPERB sound quality, unmatched by iPod or Rio or iRiver, but it sports some features you won't find elsewhere:- volume leveling, so all your tracks have the same volume- time scaling, so you can adjust the playback speed fast or slow, a boon for people who have audiobooks in the MP3 format (the iPod can only adjust the speed of special Audible files)- sleep timer- alarm clock (!!!)- profile settings that remember your preferences, great for sharing with other family members- pretty decent playlist management- works as an external drive in Windows- removable LiIon batteryThese features are all the more amazing because all recent Creative products (Zen Micro, Zen Touch, ...) do NOT have these features. It's sad to me that Creative has taken a step or two back in all these convenience features, which would have made their products compete better against iPod and others. Just sad.In short, if size and jog dial don't turn you off, the Zen Xtra is the best hard drive-based MP3 player.
