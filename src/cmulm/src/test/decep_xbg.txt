I had recieved for the holidays a Sony Cybershot Digital Camera (DSC-P73), which did come with a 16MB memory stick. The 16MB memory stick would be nice for low reslution pics and vids, but I personality enjoy full screen, and the 16MB is clearly not enough. So, I also recieved this as a gift. I'm glad I didn't get anything smaller, because there wouldn't be enough to hold enough. If I got something bigger, it would be much to expensive, and I would be wasting money for a bunch of space I didn't use and never would use. With this, it gives a good amount of pics capacity and you can film about 11 minutes on the 640 standard version. Though, this is not a very big memory stick such as the 512MB, it does cost a lot of $$. Also, Sony and Sandisk try to push you into buying it because of some Magicgate thing. Magicgate is not a befenit or a letdown, it's just a camera supporter. Also, the memory stick is NOT PRO. All memory stick are the same and the only difference between any of them would be the size capacity. So, go ahead and buy this memory stick, considering you will probably need it on the long run if you are into high resolution, but remember that Magicgate and Memory Stick Pro are things to convince you to buy it and really have no difference whatsoever.
