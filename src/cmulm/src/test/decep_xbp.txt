This used to cost over [$$$] each, but now can be had for such a good price on amazon, so I bought two. Upon unwrapping my initial excitement evaporated very quickly when I found out how poor-quality this product is. One of the two does not charge at all -- the start-up screen warns no batteries". The other seems to charge but doesn't hold the charge for long. The upshot: you'll need to keep this plugged in AT ALL TIME to use it. I was simply dismayed by such a display of very poor quality control. The Cybiko is "designed and made in Taiwan."The user experience started low but even got lower. The user interface is ugly, and guess what, the company Cybiko no longer exists in the U.S. (they still have an operation in the UK) so there's no support and no game downloads. Maybe that's why it's being sold at bargain basement price. Chat works out of the box, but the other applications require downloads, and I still haven't figured out how to do that since there's no software included, and just a very simple instructions sheet that doesn't tell you much. (Not even a word on charging.)In summary, I do NOT recommend you buy this. Yes it's cheap, but the quality is absolutely terrible. The battery doesn't work, the screen is low-quality, and the entire design is very disappointing."
