I use the rca to TR all the time on my mixer to go to powered speakers or do send/returns. This is just a basic stereo set at 6.5 feet that has no hum even though single ended (non differential).I really like hosa's build quality and heavy duty cables. Never a bit of hum even on the single end &lt;> differential mixer connections.I use a 25' version made by another company and they are just as good going to speakers, however these are laminated making for a convenient cable set.for the price and cable quality I've never gone wrong with hosa. Try a set - the price is right ahd the quiet sound. I'm really impressed.
