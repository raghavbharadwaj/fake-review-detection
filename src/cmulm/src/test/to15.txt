Yup.......this is the one. If the zombie apocalypse happened today.....I would take a knife, water purification tablets, and this toaster into the brush with me.... and head south. I'd figure out how to build the generator out of twigs and rocks and stuff later.....so I could get it to fully function again.ORFirst contact with the aliens.....Say Nothing.....we just hand them one of these.ORSeriously....this toaster is great...hands down the best toaster we have ever owned. Take a frozen bagel...defrost it...and toast it perfectly...pushing 3 buttons...really? Yup, and it looks good doing it.
