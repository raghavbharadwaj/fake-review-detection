The Archos AV300/320 holds a lot of promise as an all-in-one entertainment center that lets you play video, audio, photos, and more. It works well as a DVR (digital video recorder) and can be fun to use, but there are many problems that make the high price tag rather unjustified.First of all the documentation is rather inadequate and confusing. Same goes for the interface. Your second impression would be how cheap" the device looks and feels upon unwrapping. Don't expect your friends to go "wow" when they see it, although the 3.8" screen, when turned on, can get their attention. On the other hand, two problems: first, the screen is passive-matrix, not active-matrix. And I thought nobody uses passive-matrix any more! Second, the "big" screen drains the built-in LiIon battery fast; I average about 2 hours watching videos. So don't expect to pack this with you luggage so you can watch a feature film on your next flight. Third this is a brick and quite heavy for a modern portable, even without the DVR adapter (which you need to copy CDs and DVDs) and the bulky AC adapter. Finally, customer support is rather inadequate, you get long waits on hold and unhelpful support technicians.On the plus side, you can indeed copy DVDs to the AV320, although that would be illegal. Any lawyers here to clarify the situation? Video and audio quality is pretty good, but again, because the built-in screen is passive matrix, it leaves much to be desired.Overall, there are a lot of problems with the AV320, even though it's expensive. If you are a total gadget freak and have to have video on the go, this may be worth the price tag."
