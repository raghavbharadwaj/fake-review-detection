This is *the* mouse to have! First, unlike its bigger sibling the IntelliMouse Explorer, this one doesn't have too many buttons that simply confuse you. The buttons on this model are located at the right place for your fingers to click and they are all very resonsive.Now the pad-less operation, it's simply fantastic. I had my doubts about its useability until I tried it at CompUSA. I've been using this for weeks and it simply works on any surface I've tried. Just incredible. The movement is smooth and accurate and the feeling that you never have to worry about dust (okay, not really true since you have to keep the lens clear of dust, but better than dust-collecting mouse ball) is liberating.The shape is ergonomic, continuing Microsoft's tradition of building ergonomic input devices. I now hope there will be a wireless edition sometime soon. (MS: are you listening?)
