The HP 21 inkjet cartridge is very light, easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality, durable black ink on the page. It stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (It even comes with an expiration date!) HP also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit.One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the ink can go quickly. If you print a lot, you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. My needs are about 10 pages per week and I have to change the cartridge roughly every six to seven weeks. That's not good; although to be fair to this HP ink cartridge I am printing graphics.As of the time that I am writing this, why don't we get a better discount for buying two cartridges? I notice the price to buy two is just slightly less than twice the cost of one of these HP 21 ink cartridges--but buying two should be cheaper still since you're buying two and not just one at a time; instead HP wants their customers to pay twice without giving them any discount or price improvement." You might save a little over a dollar by buying this twinpack; but that's not much. There's just no discount nor is there any financial incentive to buy more than one at a time--and, as one reviewer notes, this is a disappointment.Three and one-half stars for being great ink in easy to manage and install cartridges. It loses one and one-half stars for not lasting longer AND not giving customers a discount for buying more than one cartridge at a time."
