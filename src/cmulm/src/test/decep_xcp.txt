The guy in Atlanta makes some good points, but two caveats: 1) Fujitsu's plasma offerings are actually better than Toshiba, not by much, but you can tell the difference (if you are in New York, go to Harvey Electronics at ABC Carpet to see for yourself), 2) the Samsung receiver is cheap and works cheap; get a better receiver from Sony or JVC.
