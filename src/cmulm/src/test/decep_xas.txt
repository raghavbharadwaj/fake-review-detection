This number 93 tri-color ink cartridge by Hewlett Packard is an essential for those of us who use the HP Deskjet 5440 printer--or any other printer that accepts this cartridge.The three colors of yellow, red and green can be combined by the printer to produce a wide array of other colors very effectively. The cartridge takes up little space if you care to stock up on them and it comes well packaged so that it won't break during shipment. Moreover, the installation and removal of the cartridge is very easy so when changing the ink cartridge you will rarely have any difficulty.My only complaint is that the ink goes rather quickly and thus the cost of this ink over the long run can be expensive. I rarely print and nevertheless just about every two months I still have to buy another cartridge. I will take off one star for that to make this a four star review.The price is absolutely right compared to what stores in my area charge for this product. If you care to save some money you can buy this ink cartridge in the same package as a black ink HP 92; this would be even more cost-efficient.Overall, the quality of the ink is rather good despite my one complaint that the ink goes faster than I would like it to go. The cartridge provides you with the ability to print a multitude of colors on your paper and replacement is easy.SMILE
