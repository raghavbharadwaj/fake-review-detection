I'm always on the hunt for a good portable CD player, as I listen to classical music exclusively. Classical music demands the most out of a hi-fi system, and MP3 players simply don't cut it for me. I got the D-NF430 because it also has FM/AM/TV/WB which will come in handy when the next disaster, natural or manmade, strikes. (Short-wave, anyone?)Like most Sony hi-fi systems, the D-NF430 has very clean and pleasing sound output over a good pair of earphones. The digital processor inside the unit does an admirable job expressing the rich spectrum of sounds from masterpieces by Beethoven and alike. This model also operates faster than my previous D-NE320, from starting up to skipping ahead. The radio works well, too.However, compared to Panasonic portable CD players, of which I own a few models, Sony CD walkmans" tend to be harder to use. The D-NF430 has a very strange arrangement of buttons, and functions you might often use, like random play and EQ adjustment, are relegated to a hard-to-access menu system. Panasonic, on the other hand, allows you to do everything via dedicated buttons. The location of the Hold button on this unit is also unconventional. (Hint: it's at the bottom.)What's more, this unit is relatively bulky. Made in Malaysia (a country hostile towards the U.S.), the build quality is not among the best; on my new unit, for instance, the tune+/group+ button feels really flimsy like it's going to just fall off anytime. On the positive side, the player gives you amazing battery life on a single AA alkaline.In short, this is a good value-oriented player that gives you good-quality sound and good radio functions. You can also play MP3 files burned on CD-R/CD-RW discs -- up to 30 hours on a single AA battery. The interface could be better, but the price is right."
