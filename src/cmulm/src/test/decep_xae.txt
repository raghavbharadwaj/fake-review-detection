So far I bought 3 HDTV PVR solutions and this is the only one that actually works. It runs on a single core intel 3.6 Ghz proc and uses about 30% CPU at worst case. The system was built with the intention of making an HDTV recorder and would not run the ATI card (HDTV wonder) product, which is when I finally started looking at USB devices.The only complaint is the software's first generation documentation has features that the actual software lacks (such as editing your recordings) - but as for capture and playback of a full 1080x1920 picture it does the job. I am using a 24 dell 1200x1920 LCD monitor with a digital (DVI) connection to a NVIDIA 7900 card and 4GB of ram in the motherboard. Two seagate 750 SATA drives are raid-0'ed to make a 1.5 TB storage disk for HD recordings.Ignoring the money I wasted buying the ATI solution, this cost less to build than the sony HDTV recorder, and I can write things I want to keep off to DLT tape (80 GB per tape) or when HD DVD RW discs come of age, I can use that solution. For now, the 1.5 TB disk has plenty of room for well over a hundred hours of 1080x1920 HD recording.The playback and recording are perfect - the sound in always in sync - and the timer never misses an event (which can be scheduled LONG in advance).The only thing I have not tried is a DVI-HDMI interface cable simply because my other HDTV sets are older and lack the HDMI interface.You should also orient the front of the box towards the seating area for the remote to work as it has an integrated remote IR receiver in the USB box."
