I found Samsung blank CD-Rs at a local dollar store. I thought, what the heck. I only bought 2 CD-Rs. I used the first one on a music mix of 20 songs. Wow, at 52x these are awesome! The burn very fast, and are not faulty.The music was very good sounding. One problem is that it did scratch easily, but that's okay because I own a CD-Case to keep my CDs safe from damage.These CD-Rs were so good, I bought the 10-Pack. Still no faulty ones, besides the first one at the dollar store. If you need just a couple 10 more CD-Rs, this will do very well.
