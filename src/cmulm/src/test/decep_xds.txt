I just recently chose to take a position at OneCall_com but previously I was working at Targus so I know a few things about backpack construction, and I can tell you this is one heck of a nice backpack. It is rugged in construction, has useful pockets and multiple zippered compartments. I honestly store not only my Digital Rebel XT in the backpack but my Sony HD Camcorder as well. I put the blank MiniDV tapes in one zippered compartment, the unused MiniDV tapes in another compartment, the Digital Rebel XT spare batteries in one of the elastic netting compartments inside of a zippered pouched, extra lense in the main compartment with the camcorder down the middle and the camera laying across the top (I take the external flash off).I begged Targus to come up with a really good professional level digital camera carry case solution but as of the time I left, they still weren't offering one. ;-(Good work Canon!!
