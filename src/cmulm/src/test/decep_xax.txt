The new 12 iBook has everything you need in a super-portable laptop. It's 20 percent faster than the model it replaces and 20 percent cheaper, with a hundred-buck price cut and wireless networking included.The iBook features a brilliant, small screen, 4+hour battery, 4.9 pounds, an array of fast ports, industry-leading styling and the best repair record in the industry, according to Consumer Reports. Reliability and service is especially important with temperamental laptops. Apple laptops also never come with the cheap integrated graphics you will find on similarly priced PC products.There also are the usual MAC bennies: No viruses to worry about, no spyware, no pop-up ads with Safari, faster, cleaner, smarter software, painless connections to printers and networks, and the coolness factor to boot."
