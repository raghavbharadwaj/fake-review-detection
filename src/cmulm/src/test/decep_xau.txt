I bought this cooler form Eforcity. I like this product for several reasons:- Lightweight. I carry it to work every day and while traveling.- Compact. Easy to carry whether on travel or not.- Great swivel feature. Great when sharing the screen with the person next to you.- Good for ergonomics. Without it, I find myself shifting my hands to an awkward position or I end up shifting the laptop. Now I just nudge it left or right.
