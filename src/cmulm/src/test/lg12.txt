Great purchase overall. I got it as a birthday present to myself and I'm glad I chose this one. I have had it for 4 months now and I have loved every minute of it. The picture is great, sound is pretty good, and the tv itself looks really nice since the bezel is so thin. I mainly use it for gaming and netflix and it works wonders. No input lag on game mode and the picture still looks great playing ps4. glad I got this over the older model lg or the samsung equivalent.
