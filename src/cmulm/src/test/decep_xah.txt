I have the original Dimage X (the 2MP version) and now wish I had waited! The Xi has 50% more pixels and also more optical zoom. Any potential buyer should be aware that the 3X refers to optical zoom, i.e., real stuff, not digitized zoom. I find the new model even easier to hold and operate, so I don't understand why some people complain. The size and styling and the optical zoom are the main selling points, but the camera also has decent image quality and fast recycle times. If you are a casual photographer, you won't be disappointed.
