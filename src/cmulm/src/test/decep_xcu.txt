Memorex makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust. The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves!The color white is neutral and doesn't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the CD or DVD. I agree with the reviewer who notes that there is a hole in the back of the sleeve into which you can insert a flap. This ensures that the CDs and DVDs don't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another.They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room.Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price. I highly recommend these CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical and cost-efficient alternative to jewel cases.
