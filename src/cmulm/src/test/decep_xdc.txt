This rechargeable battery came with my Olympus C-50 5MP digital camera, and I'm quite satisfied with it and don't feel the need to buy a spare battery. I am not a photographer that goes out taking shots for hours on end, but I do occasionally go on picture-taking sprees on pretty days or party weekends. I haven't run into problems with the battery dying on me so far, and I've had this battery for almost 2 years now. If you know you're going to be taking a lot of pictures, leave home with a full battery and you should be fine.
