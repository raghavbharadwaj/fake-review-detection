The Sunpak 2001UT tripod is a good basic tripod, esp. for digital cameras. The reason for my saying this is that this is a light-weight tripod, and its maximum load is about 4.2 pounds. This is sufficient for digital cameras that do not use interchangeable lenses, and also for SLRs or digital SLRs that use a lightweight lens. So, if you have a 300mm telephoto or zoom lens on your SLR you MUST get something heavier and sturdier. For others whose camera (plus lens) is less than 4 pounds, this lightweight tripod is perfect. It's pretty good quality, easy to use, has a quick-release camera plate (so you can take the plate with the camera for that quick handheld shot), and is light enough to carry with you anywhere you go.
