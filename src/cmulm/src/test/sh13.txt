I bought a handheld pet vacuum from Shark and loved it so much that when my other vacuum died, I knew immediately that I would want a full size Shark. This thing is SO amazing!!!!! the fact that it has a 9" wide head is perfect, because then I can go through chairs, and under tables easier. The suction is so strong that it practically pulls me around the house. This thing sucked up so much stuff that was apparently buried deep in the carpet, I was shocked. It is lightweight, a nice size for storage and is so easy to dump out and put back together. This vacuum is excellent!! Best I've ever had.
