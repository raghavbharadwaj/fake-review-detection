This Sony system is rocking!!!Sound Quality - The sound of it is wonderful, and clear. Those 400 watt stereos do have a much better bass, but there design is lacking, and the treble is very muffled. The CMTHPX9 has great treble, and may not have 400 or 500 watts in it, but it still delivers some extreme bass.Design - As I said before, the CMTHPX9's design is excellent. Not only is it easy to use and to set-up, but it is decent looking, unlike the HXGX7, which looks like a techno design mayhem. Also, the system is pretty small (though a bit big for executive), so it will fit on a normal 3-shelf bookshelf (system at the top, speakers in the middle, your stuff at the bottom, something like that).Features - Do NOT LOOK AT THE SYSTEM TO SEE IT'S FEATURES. The system does look like it has low features, but the remote has tons more. Including an equalizer, clock, special display features, and much more.Cost - This is a low point for the system. The 400-watt system is about 50 cents per watt, while this is about $1.06 per watt, making the more watted units more than double the value.Overall - This may cost more than most units, though the design and features overway some of the more watted units like the HX-GX7, MHCGX450, and the SCPM39D. And for some, the CMTHPX9 outways just of the design (some of these shelf units make my eyes bleed a.k.a. HXGX7).4.5 stars/5 stars (rounds to five)
