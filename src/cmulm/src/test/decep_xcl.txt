Since digital links either work or they don't I bought the least expensive 50 foot cable I could get to run my HD PVR to the back bedroom for viewing.Note: my cable came with gold plated ends even though the pictures show just plain metal ends. I don't know if that is standard but the quality of the cable in person was higher than the picture show.I was very impressed about how easily the cable uncoiled and did not fight me going through the attic. Alot of coiled cables shipped tend to hold their coil shape for years it seems, but this one layed flat from day one making installation easier.All taken it works with no problems, no dropouts, no pixelation, and HDCP runs fine over it. I can't complain in any way so 5 stars.
