Last month I lost my loyal Aiwa earphones, and started looking for a replacement. Nowadays all the stores are selling ugly clip-on phones, which I hate. Finally, I found the Sony MDR-E829V at a local store. I was attracted by the classic ear-bud design and the inline volume control, so I bought it.What a great buy. This is the best pair of earphones I've ever owned, even besting my previous Aiwa ones (which were 50% cheaper, though). Earlier this year I bought a different Sony ear-bud set and hated it, but this one is so much better. Sound from my MP3 player is crisp and clear, with lots of good-quality bass. The best feature is the inline volume control. I have some audiobook MP3s which used to sound soft on the Aiwa and my Koss audiophile headphones, but I had to actually turn down the volume on these Sony earphones! I reall love the MDR-E829V and highly, highly recommend it to anyone looking for ear-bud phones.In fact I'm buying two more pairs as back-ups.
