Went to visit girl friends in Chicago,(As a former Chicagoan, I wanted to go here since I watched Stephanie win Top Chef) was told no way we'd get in without reservations 8 weeks in advance.....found out walk ins can sit at the bar or the very low table and bench area up front...first come, first serve. Got there early, the regular bar was full, we sat at the VERY low table bench set up ( don't wear a short skirt) Great waitress, went on a Sunday night, Had A loooong wait between courses with different food runners bringing each order. The fish crudo with crispy pork belly was amazing, as were desserts, ( goat milk cheese cake was the bomb) Cocktails are wicked, but pricy. Three women with three cocktails a piece and a not huge assortment of dishes was 300 before tax and tip. We lingered and chatted and people watched for almost three hours with no rush out the door, which was very nice.
