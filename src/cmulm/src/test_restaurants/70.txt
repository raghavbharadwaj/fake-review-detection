This was our third visit to Shaw's Crab House in Chicago. The first time we ate at Shaw's was on a whim because it was within reasonable walking distance from our hotel. After eating there that first time and having great seafood and excellent service, we have continued to go back to Shaw's whenever we are in Chicago. Each and every time we have eaten at Shaw's the restaurant has been packed. Table space is really premium real estate as the tables are very close together. The menu is fairly expansive with a number of fresh fish, seafood dishes and even sushi. One side of the restaurant is an oyster bar which we have not tried. The entrees we have ordered have been very generous portions. The side dishes were large enough to feed three people, so go hungry if you order multiple side dishes. The waitstaff is extremely attentive and we have been well taken care of each time we have visited.
