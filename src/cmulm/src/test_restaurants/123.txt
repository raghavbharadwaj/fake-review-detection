Four of us went to Gibson's. First we enjoyed sitting by the piano listening to Bob play and sing while we enjoyed some drinks. We even joined in on a few of the songs. Then we were escorted in to the dining area. Our waiter, Elvis, was very knowledgeable and humorous! We ordered our WR steaks, potatoes and a vegetable. The steaks were done to perfection! The char grilling on the outside of the steaks was amazing! The meat just melted in our mouths as did the mashed potatoes. By the time we finished, we were too full for dessert which was a shame as the desserts looked divine! All in all we had a great experience! A few weeks later we had to try the Gibson's in Rosemont as well. (just as great!)
