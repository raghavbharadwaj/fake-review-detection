Got a table reserved for 7pm for four in the morning. On arrival we have to wait few minutes! Tables are too close! Everybody is talking loudly while waiters are really shouting. It's fun to listen to the shouting waiters dramatizing the menu~ We understood only half of the menu story of our friendly African American waiter. However we agree with him that their steak was the best. Since the portions were huge we shared the steak and lobsters. It was the most delicious steak I had in Chicago~ it was fun, easy, fast, delicious and value for money!!
