I went to the Purple Pig restaurant on friday night with my brother and his wife. It was their first time visiting Chicago so of course they wanted to eat somewhere downtown. I have to admit i'm not a big fan of charcuterie but on the advice of a friend we decided to try the Purple Pig, and I'm glad we did. Great and friendly staff who treat you like family from the minute you open the door(which is rare for a downtown restaurant). We were initially seated near the kitchen door, I then asked if we could have a table near the front window they switched us with no problems. The star of the night was the menu. For anyone who thinks this is just a pork restaurant think again. Huge selection of menu items for a variety of different tastes. I had the salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese, and one of the best deviled eggs i have ever eaten. Our table had two excellent bottles of rioja wine. I would definitely recommend Purple Pig. Trust me, you will be pleasantly suprised.
