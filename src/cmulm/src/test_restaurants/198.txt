Even though I have visited the Hancock observation deck many many times since it opened in 1969, I was still amazed at the view! We were seated next to a large south window. We were warmly welcomed by the staff and served promptly and courteously - as we would expect at those prices. The buffet was limited, compared to NYC's (now closed) Rainbow Room or The Plaza, but the price includes one prepared dish per person. All six of us had tasty - but not extraordinary - dishes. You pay for the view, but the food is more than adequate. One surprise was that some of the patrons wore sweats, and even "camo"! I'm not one for stuffy dress, (a sweater and khakis) but these folks were nearly disconcerting, and we enjoyed a laugh on them. We alI would visit again.
