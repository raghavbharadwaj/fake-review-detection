An evening at the Frontera Grill is a mini trip to Mexico. From the vibrant colors on the walls. to the festive sounding music that takes over the minute you walk in the door. The food, all made from farm fresh ingredients is all just right. The creamy guacamole is an excellent appetizer. The steak fahitas easily feeds two people. Their signature margarita makes you want to dance all night The atmosphere was nice. The food was good. You will find me there on many Friday nights
