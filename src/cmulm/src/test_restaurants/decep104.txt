My wife and I were on vacation/visiting friends in Indy looking for a good local restaurant for dinner when we came upon the Weber Grill Restaurant. It looked good from the outside and we later found that the food served inside was even better. We wondered if the name was the same Weber of the grill fame and it turned our it is. I am always in the mood for a great steak or chops, so lucky for me the Weber Grill specializes in these items. I chose the Lamb chops because I cannot turn them down when I find them on a menu. My wife opted for the strip steak. Both were seasoned and cooked to perfection. The sides were great and the portion sizes were generous. Neither of us were super hungry after the main course, but the double chocolate bundt cake looked too good to turn down so we split one. Good decision on ordering and sharing it. It was awesome. But there is no way I could have finished the whole thing myself. If you are ever near any of the handful of Weber Grill locations, stop in and you will not regret it.
