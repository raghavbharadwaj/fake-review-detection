We went on recommendations from friends to Purple Pig on New Years Eve and had a blast! The wine was wonderful and the food incredible. My friend is a vegetarian so don't be frightened off by the name. While there is a lot of pork on the menu there are many other options as well. The wait staff was extremely knowledgeable about the food and the wine. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. They have a small plates menu that is extremely resonably priced. We ate way too much but you don't have to. You could just go and have a small plate and a glass of wine. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Chicago. And it's right on Michigan Ave. so the location is very convenient.
