My husband and I are the parents of a young child and we finally got the chance to have a night away, so after a bit of coin tossing we decided to give Gibsons' a try. I have to say, the coin was in our favor! We did arrive at a popular time, but the wait was no more than you'd expect before we were seated, and we got drinks right away. The lobster cocktail may be the greatest thing I've ever eaten. Seriously? Try it, it's amazing! My husband is an absolute Prime Rib junkie and he's still talking about it. The prices seem on par, if not a little higher than our other favorite, Morton's..but in the end, we've definitely decided we'll be going back! Great service! Great food! Great experience all around!
