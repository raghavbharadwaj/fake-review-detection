It seems like the owners of this restaurant can't decide what they want it to be: the cutesy name and the horrifically loud pop music says it wants to be a hip, downtown meeting place where people don't really have to talk to each other; the fabulous mezze-portioned, Mediterranean-inspired dishes and interesting, thorough, and accessible wine list says this could be a super place for couples, group of friends, or anyone who appreciates great food and wine to meet, eat, and drink. Unfortunately, these same people will find it hard to TALK to each other without shouting across the table. This is a wondeful restaurant--but PLEASE turn the volume down!
