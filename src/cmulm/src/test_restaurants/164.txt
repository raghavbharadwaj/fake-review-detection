We went more than once for lunch to this place while we were in Chicago: the food was very good (especially the thin crust pizzas) and extremely reasonably priced (as was the wine), the service good and friendly (without being gushy), and the atmosphere lively. The restaurant produces a number of its own products, such as 'duck prosciutto'. We did find it was necessary to state very clearly that we did not want main courses arriving whilst we were still eating starters, though. The only drawback - no vino santo in which to dip the excellent biscotti.
