Excellent meal with my wife here, excellent clilles rellenos- best we've had, with well done rice and beans, 24 is more than typical but this is not typical food. Guacamole dip was small portion size and high in price- 9.75. House margaritas were served in a martini glass- so small in size- and 11. Ate in the bar, pleasant and active atmosphere. Overall very good, just be prepared to expect more quality and flavor and more cost than typical tex-mex.
