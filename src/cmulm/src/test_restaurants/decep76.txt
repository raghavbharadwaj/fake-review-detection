The most incredible seafood dishes are to be had at Shaw's. I love that they even serve sushi. Prices are well worth the visit and Sunday brunch is definitely worth checking out! Once you try a locally brewed coffee, you will never want to drink any other kind of coffee. Plus, the prices are less than a lot of other places that serve coffee blends.
