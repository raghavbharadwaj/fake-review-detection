My wife and I decided to eat at The Purple Pig the other night, since one of my friends suggested it to me. Our first impression as we entered the restaurant was how beautiful the interior looked. The atmosphere was definitely fit for a date night with a significant other. The restaurant had a variety of wine to choose from. I chose a bottle of red wine from Spain but do not remember what it was called. My wife and I enjoyed it but that was just the beginning. The food there was amazing to say the least. My wife ordered the slow roasted ham panini and she said it was the best panini she had ever tasted. I had always enjoyed Mediterranean food and luckily it was the restaurant's specialty. I had the chicken thigh kebabs with fried smash potatoes and it did not disappoint. The price was reasonable and the food was off the charts. Although the service was average, I had nothing to complain about. I would definitely recommend The Purple Pig to my friends. Good food, great wine, a 10 out of 10 in my book.
