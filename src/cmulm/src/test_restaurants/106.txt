This restaurant was fantastic, the food was so good and the atmosphere and decor were incredible. We made reservations through opentable.com and were seated quickly (it was a weeknight). I ordered the Tuscan brick chicken which was so moist and incredibly delicious; my husband couldn't stop raving about his sausage and brisket, they were so moist and the best he'd had. I tried the sangria of the day, limoncello, and it was a bit too tart with the overwhelming pineapple-but still good. I would absolutely go back here again and would recommend it to my friends.
