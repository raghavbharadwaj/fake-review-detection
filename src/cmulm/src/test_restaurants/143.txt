I just had my fifth meal at this place, and as usual, I was not disappointed. It is a great place for innovative American cuisine. Service is always outstanding and I appreciate the knowledge & the patience of the servers. I have some dietary restrictions, and the servers always take the time to point out what options I have on the menu. It is also incredibly affordable. I usually order a drink, the bread, several small plates (which usually I share with my dining companions) and dessert and I leave spending between 40-50 dollars, including a 20% tip. My favorite dishes from my last visit include the sauteed green beans, roasted cauliflower, chickpea fritters & scallops. My friends also had the leg of goat (which you must preorder 24 hours in advance) and have not stopped raving about it. Bread costs extra, but it is worth it. Its always good. In a city that is jam packed with interesting and outstanding dining options, the Girl & the Goat is one of my favorites. Well done.
