I'll cut to the chase. We're here for the steak. Bone in strip and filet, wet aged, the best steak I've ever had and I've had a lot of steak at a lot of great steak houses. Went at 7pm on Saturday but dress was casual. I was wearing shorts from a day at the science museum. The place was packed and loud, it was not unpleasant though. Meal comes with salad. The desserts are excellent and very, very, large. None of us could endure a dessert after that steak. We went back the next day and five of us shared a chocolate mousse cake. The staff was excited to hear we came back just for dessert. Service was excellent. We will go back when we're in Chicago. Make a reservation if you want a seat.
