Went to Girl and the Goat while visiting the Chicago area, and I can't thank who recommended it enough. Like the name would imply, it's not a typical restaurant. With such a great staff it has the atmosphere of having a meal with a bunch of best friends you just met. The staff was so much fun, and the food was great as well as the craft beers. I heard that all the produce (including the meat) is produced on local farms, so it is guaranteed to be fresh. Would highly recommend Girl and a Goat to anyone.
