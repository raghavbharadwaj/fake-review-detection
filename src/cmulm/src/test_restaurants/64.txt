Eat in the main dining room. Old School seafood perfection. Room is dark paneled wood. Service is always spot on. Love the scallops and the crab cakes. The oyster bar on the casual side is nice, festive, lively; however, we prefer the dining room. Noise is at a minimum, menu is slightly different and service is better.
