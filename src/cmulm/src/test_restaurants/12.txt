On a Saturday late lunch, starving, we followed the advice that friends gave us. Choice between a formal dining room with tables fully dressed, or the bar section, with high tables. We settled for the high tables. Quick and efficient service, we ordered the Joe's seafood lunch, their "signature" lunch choice. It was great. Even the hash brown was delicious, crusty. The crab was excellent. And as a finishing touch, a waiter comes with sliced lemon over a small bowl so you can clean your hands after eating the crab :-) The ambience is very cosy. An all dark wooden bar, two discrete TVs, a good mix of people. We'll clearly go back for trying the rest :-)
