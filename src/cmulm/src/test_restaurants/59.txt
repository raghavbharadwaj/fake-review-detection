Along with a few glasses of wine, DH and I had the pork-fried almonds, pork neck bone rillette, 3 cheeses (podda, caveman blue, and a 3rd I can't recall), followed by the lemon panna cotta with our coffees. Although we did not order it, we were introduced to the uber-trendy burrata pugliese, so if you're looking to try that, this may be the place. Lunchtime was a comfortable level of crowd and noise, and a feeling of good fun permeated the place. The food was good and the menu a refreshing change from the usual. In particular, charcuterie and French food lovers will enjoy. This is DH's favourite in Chicago.
