Eating at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab Restaurant is an outstanding dinner. The wait staff are all at the top of their game remembering every little detail we requested with ease. The Spinach Stuffed Mushroom Caps were a definite restaurant specialty on the appetizer menu. We absolutely had to try the Stone Crabs that the restaurant is known for, and were delighted with the quality and freshness. They made a great addition to the Filet Mignon which was juicy and tender and seared to perfection. To top it all off we shared a Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge sauce for dessert and were delighted with rich taste! A definite go-to on our list!
