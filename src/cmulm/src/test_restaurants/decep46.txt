What more can I possibly say but this: WOW! The Purple Pig was absolutely amazing! Very contemporary and modern styling was definitely on point. Selection of wines and cheeses were exactly what I expected. Prices were reasonable and were definitely not above the industry norm. Quiet, relaxing atmosphere. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and had sampled every dish to add to his knowledge. I would definitely recommend The Purple Pig to anyone!
