First visit to a place who's name I've known for years but never had the pleasure to enjoy. Their reputation of being a top tier steakhouse is well founded. Can't speak to the "crowds" reviewed by others but frankly, most places worth it have crowds. I arrived at 7:00pm and found an empty stool at the bar, quickly greated by friendly bartenders while talkative still had that edge that lets you know it's their place and you're in good hands. Piano player provided pleasant entertainment for bar area. Generous pour on martini's. Wedge salad was good and would please any wedge fan. Other patrons were enjoying the avocado crab appetizer which they all raved about. Ribeye was cooked perfectly and had great beef flavor, served with house speciality twice baked potato that is large enough for 2 people. I'm a big eater and accepted a friendly challenge from bartender to finish the entire potato myself but fell slightly short. Overall good place and would recommend. Situated on Rush Street so plenty of happenings around as well.
