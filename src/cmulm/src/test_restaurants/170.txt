Great food...great service...live restaurant with lots of action, while priced very well. You've got to try this place. Italian food with a twist, tapis style, which you normally find in a Spanish type of restaurant. Begin with some cheese to snack on and move onto some entrees. Small portions that you share. Everyone can order and share their dish. You get to taste a lot of different foods and you have to try the chocolate fondue. Highly recommend this place.
