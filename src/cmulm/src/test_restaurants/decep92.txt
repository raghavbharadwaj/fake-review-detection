Fontera Grill is one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. Simply stated, no other Mexican restaurant in the city can compare. They are always introducing new dishes to the menu, and I have never had a bad experience when eating there. Chef Bayless's talent seems to know no boundaries beyond the availability of fantastic seasonal ingredients in a place so distant from Mexico. It also seems that no matter what meal I eat there, I am always pleased with the dishes I receive. I especially love the Sunday Brunches, mostly because of the fantastic cocktails that are available. Like the food, these change with the seasons, but they are all wonderful and refreshing. The only problem I have with Fontera is that is can be hard to get into sometimes. They are no longer a Chicago secret (for good reason!) and you now have to have reservations weeks in advance for a Friday or Saturday night. Luckily, that is never a problem for me because I book a table every other week regardless! I would recommend Fontera to anyone who asked. Seriously, it's just that good.
