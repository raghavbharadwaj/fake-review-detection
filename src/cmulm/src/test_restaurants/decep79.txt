Interested in some surf and turf? Check out Shaw's Crab House on E. Hubbard St. in Chicago. Their vast menu displays the quality of the items that they serve. My dinner consisted of sushi, twin lobster tails, and a glass of red wine to wash it down. The lobster tasted like it was caught out of the ocean minutes before it entered my mouth. Shaw's also serves as a perfect spot to take that special person out. The gorgeous dining room and selection of fresh cuisine will be sure to impress your date.
