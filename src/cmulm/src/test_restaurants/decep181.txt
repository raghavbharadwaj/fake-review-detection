All I have to say is WOW! after visiting Quartino in downtown Chicago. The menu was rustic and everything I tried I loved! As an olive aficionado, that was my favorite part! The service was speedy and professional. It's a good wait staff when you hardly know they're there unless they are helping you out specifically. We stopped by on a Tuesday, which was disappointing since my party wanted the half-off wine deal. Nevertheless, a GREAT experience at Quartino Chicago. I would go back in a heartbeat, or faster!
