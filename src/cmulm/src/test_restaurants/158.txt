This resto was the "must go" destination on a recent girl's trip to Chicago, and it didn't disappoint. In fact, it was a highlight of the trip. Even on a Sunday night at 9:00 in the middle of a rainstorm, the place was packed and buzzing. I was worried it didn't live up to they hype, but it so did and more. We chose our plates and they brought them to us in perfectly paired order. The second last pairing - the cauliflower and chicken together were outstanding, I wanted to lick the plates clean. And then, I wanted to cry it was gone. It truly was that good. I cannot recommend this resto enough - the flavours were unlike anything I've ever had. Do yourself a favour and go.
