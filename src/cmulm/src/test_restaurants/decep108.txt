There is not a restaurant in Chicago that I would more recommend than Weber Grill Restaurant. We were able to be seated right away when we came in. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They were able to suggest the perfect meal, seeing that it was my first time eating at the restaurant. My Prime NY Strip was cooked exactly the way I asked. My husband ordered lobster and he was satisfied as well. They were also very family friendly, and had some great options for my youngest child. Last but not least, the wine was some of the best that I have ever tasted. For such a great meal, this restaurant was surprisingly very affordable. I would definitely recommend it.
