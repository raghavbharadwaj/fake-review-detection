We visited this restaurant twice at lunchtime during our week in Chicago and it was great. Deliciously cooked fresh food, fascinating combinations of unusual ingredients, good service, good wines, central location, pleasant atmosphere, and above all highly recommended for any Europeans who find themselves struggling in vain to munch their way through the vast portions served up at the normal American restaurant The Purple Pig is ideal for a tasty lunch that leaves your revived and fit for an energetic session of afternoon sightseeing. Recommend the sardines with fennel and the bread pudding.
