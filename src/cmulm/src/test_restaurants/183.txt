Went here for a special occasion dinner and honestly the experience and view cannot be beat. Upon arriving at the Hancock tower, there was a line about a mile long to use the elevator to go to the lounge and restaurant. I approved the guard as I was unsure if that was where i was supposed to be and he asked if I had reservations and when I told him yes, he told me to go to the front of the line and the hostess would greet us and take us right up which she did and we were seated within 5 minutes. Reservations are a must and you will have zero issues. There were tons of people waiting and we walked right in so worth a little prior planning. Food was great, service was great and had the most amazing view from the women's restroom. I bet that will be the only time you hear that! Pricey but great for special occasions.
