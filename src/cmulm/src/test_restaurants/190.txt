We had 7 people in our group for a lunch there. We ordered different dishes, and, every dish was excellent, with reasonable prices. I ordered the Salad with Lobster. It was beautifully arranged, and very tasteful. Compliment to the Chef! The view from above the city was great! We could see the buildings and the harbor with sailing boats. It was just magnificent. The wait staff was very attentive and courteous. The decor is modern and comfortable. We truly enjoyed that lunch.
