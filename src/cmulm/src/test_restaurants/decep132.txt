Looking for a nice date-night restaurant?...Gibson will fit the bill. It has a good, top drawer, classy-without-being-ostentatious atmosphere, lit in a quiet way that fosters intimate dining and an overall good vibe. (If you are there in the right time of year, add some oysters on the half shell as an appitizer, they are top quality, fresh, small and a real treat). My favorite steak order is their one pound "WR" sirloin...and you can depend on the fact that you will receive your steak rare/medium rare/-whatever/ EXACTLY the way you ask for it. The service is very good, the wait staff were attentive without being intrusive, and knowlegable about specific items I asked about, both bar and menu listings. A word of warning about the valet parking though...yes, it will be necessary, given the area...but with a charge of 14.00. (OK, I know this is supposed to be a fake review, but I really have had lovely evenings at the Gibson's in Rosemont)
