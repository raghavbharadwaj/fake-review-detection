I love Joe's Seafood. I am a seafood enthusiast and have been to every seafood restaurant in the Chicago area, and Joe's is the best by a longshot! Their seafood is fresh and always tastes like it was just pulled from the ocean. Their dishes compliment the seafood perfectly and taste as if it were served by Posiden himself, haha! But really, it's the best. Their prices are more then fair for the quality of food and service you receive at Joe's. Everytime I have company visiting me I take them to Joe's and they always agree with me that it's the best seafood they have ever tasted!
