Was able to get in an hour earlier than reservation. Even in on a Saturday night. Had a drink at the bar while waiting for our table and the service was great (even when I spilled the beer across the bartop.) You can see your food being prepared on the weber grills which is cool. Has a family section and a couples section:) The food was excellent. Prime Rib was very tasty. The prices were unbelievable. Under $55 for 2 Prime Rib dinners.
