It was recently on the cover of Chicago magazine as one of the city's best new restaurants. We had to check it out. They do not take reservations so go at an "off" hour if you don't want to wait. We arrived at 5 on a Saturday and were seated immediately, but ten minutes later people were lining up. It's right on Michigan north of the bridge. It's theme is "cheese, wine and swine" and it delivers on all counts. The wine list is good. We asked if we didn't finish our bottle of wine could we cork it and our server readily agreed. Turns out, it was an unnecessary request! Beer is also available. Hubby and I could not decide so the server suggested we start with a couple of the plates and then order more when ready. it was a good plan. We had a lovely fresh tasting asparagus salad and a nice olive plate. Later we had the roasted pork shoulder and mashed potatoes that everyone raves about--deservedly so! i forget the other dishes but everything was very good. Fun lively atmosphere. In the center are big communal tables, Service was excellent throughout. Big thumbs up!
