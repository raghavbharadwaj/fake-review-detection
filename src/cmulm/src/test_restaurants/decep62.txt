I stopped in at the Purple Pig for lunch today, and had a great experience. The staff members were really friendly, and the food was terrific. This was my first time stopping at this restaurant, and I was really impressed with both the service and the food. I ordered the Meatball Slider with Parmesan & Arugula, and also treated myself to dessert (Affogato, which is soft ice cream with espresso over it). My slider was prepared perfectly, and the espresso was great (not too bitter). The prices were reasonable for the quality of the food. I definitely plan to go back, and soon!
