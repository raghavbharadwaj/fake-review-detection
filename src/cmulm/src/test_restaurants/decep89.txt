First time when I stepped into this restaurant, I felt upbeat! The atmosphere of this restaurant was very lively. I loved the music, the decoration, and most of all the waiter who served my table. He was very attentive and friendly although the restaurant was pretty busy at that time. Since I was still full from my late lunch, I decided to order just an entree called Carne Asada el Mole Negro (hope I spelled it right). It was quite pricey but absolutely delicious. My friend got herself Torta Ahogada. She let me have some, and again, it was very tasty and healthy too. While we were eating, the owner even came to our table and asked how do we like the food. Overall, this restaurant deserves 5 stars and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends because I am sure they will not be disappointed. I am now mouthwatering and thinking about going back to this place again tomorrow!
