Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab was amazing! First off, because I had never visited before and was only visiting Chicago as well, I wanted to check the menu online. I was not disappointed! Their full menu was available, with descriptions of each item. I tried the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms as an appetizer and the Seared Ahi Tuna Sandwich as my entree and was not disappointed! Both were delicious and cooked to perfection. The service was also fantastic. I received my food quickly and it was correct on the first try (something I never take for granted) and our waitress was courteous and attentive. It's like she knew I was thirsty before I did! Overall, I recommend this place to anyone in the area. It is well worth a try.
