My girlfriend and I came to Gibsons for our anniversary dinner and were delighted at the food, ambiance, and service. To start with - while pricey, the steak is well worth it. There are a variety of portions (all huge) and styles. The feel of the restaurant it classy/dressy - we wanted a nice place to celebrate and this fit the bill perfectly. The service was delightful - fast, courteous, and with good wine recommendations (a necessity for this beer drinker!). If you still have room, the desserts are to die for. An added bonus - convenient valet service out front. Five stars! The perfect fancy date place!
