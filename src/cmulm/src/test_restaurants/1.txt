Hosted a private birthday celebration for 17 & everything from planning long distance by phone to the dinner event went great! All staff were friendly, helpful & knowledgable. The food was really good including passed appetizers during cocktail time, salad, large choice of entrees which guests chose and several delicious desserts to chose from! Private Michael's room & our own dinner captain made the event fun & worry free for me so I could enjoy the celebration with family & friends who had flown in from all directions to celebrate our Mom's 80th birthday! Everyone enjoyed & raved about party! Thanks Joe's--will do again!
