My familyao>>s experience at Weber Grill Restaurant in Chicago was tremendous. The staff was warm, welcoming and able to answer all of our questions about the menu items. The lunch menu was more than reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food that was served. All of our entrees tasted wonderful, especially the Margherita pizza. The atmosphere provided was the best Iao>>ve ever experienced. We will definitely be visiting again, with friends next time!
