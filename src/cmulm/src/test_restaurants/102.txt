From my experience, the Weber Grill was a great spot for a good piece of barbecued meat. We went on a weeknight, at about 10 o'clock (the place stays open pretty late), and were seated opposite the open kitchen. The centerpiece of the kitchen is the string of oversized Weber grills -- the restaurant only cooks with charcoal and wood, not gas -- that fill the place with a wonderfully smoky smell. Food was terrific. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and crab cakes as appetizers, both of which were delicious. As entrees, we chose the ribs, roast chicken, meatloaf, and brisket. We enjoyed the chicken and ribs most -- not to take away anything from the meatloaf and brisket, which were both righteous as well. Service was exceptional. For example, there was a bit of confusion as to whether we had ordered both the crab cakes and the spinach/artichoke dip as appetizers (we thought we had ordered just the crab cakes). When both dishes were served, and we reminded our waiter (who thought we had ordered both) that we only ordered the crab cakes, he let us keep both appetizers on the house. It was a truly courteous and considerate move. Value was solid. Most entrees are in the $15-25 range, with burgers closer to $10 and steaks closer to $30. We felt we got our money's worth. In the future, we will turn to the Weber Grill when we crave some seriously smoky barbecue in downtown Chicago.
