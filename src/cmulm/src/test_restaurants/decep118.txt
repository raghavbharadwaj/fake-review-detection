I was extremely happy with my first visit to Weber Grill. I had the Plank Grilled Chilean Sea Bass and it was perfect. Their menu for lunch looks a good bit different from their dinner menu so I can't wait to come back and try it. Our server helped to make this a great all around experience. She helped us choose what to order, knew the menu well, and didn't but us too often or too little. All around, a great dining experience for me.
