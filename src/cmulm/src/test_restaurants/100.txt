While the wait may be long, don't despair it's worth it. While you wait, you can hang out and admire the gorgeous Mexican artwork or take a walk around the block, they will give you a call on your cell phone when your table is ready. The food is scrumptious. Have the fresh ceviche to start with freshly made chips and your appetite will only continue to grow. I had duck carnita quesadillas, nicely braised meat with some homemade tortillas, a fresh salad, and mashed black beans cooked to perfection. End the meal with a phenomenal, traditional Mexican hot chocolate and you will leave with a smile on your face for a very long time.
