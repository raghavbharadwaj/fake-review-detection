I highly recommend The Signature Room for any visitor to Chicago. It gives you a great view of the entire surrounding city. The drinks are a bit pricey, but you're mostly paying for the view & atmosphere, which is fairly upscale. It is a chill lounge which is relatively quiet and a great place to chat or hang out after dinner. The line can get long, but it moves at a decent speed.
