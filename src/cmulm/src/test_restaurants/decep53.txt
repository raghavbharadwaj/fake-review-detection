Anyone who has traveled will agree that finding suitable cuisine is nearly always a challenge. Big cities, such as Chicago, have a wide variety of different restaurants and diners all of which promising a unique dining experience. My family and I had heard about the classy restaurant named The Purple Pig from friends that had traveled there on business trips. The interior was beautifully decorated as was the outside of the restaurant. The hostess was very gracious as was the waitress, going above and beyond to ensure that our needs were met completely. Our food came out in a very timely manner. I ordered the Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic. It was absolutely exquisite. The meat was so tender that it melted in your mouth with a unique spin. My husband and I had white wine, so smooth that it just glided down our throats. We will definitely be back the next time that we are in Chicago and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a thrill of the taste buds.
