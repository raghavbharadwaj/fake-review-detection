This Chicago restaurant is a diamond in the rough. My husband and I went to the Signature Room for brunch one Sunday after recommendations from a friend. I had the steak and eggs which was delicious. It was moist and cooked to perfection. My husband had the buttermilk pancakes, which I tasted from his plate. They were fluffy and delicious. I knew what I was ordering for our next brunch. As for the atmosphere, the ambiance is very sophisticated, a classy affair. Wait time is as to be expected for a gem as this. I would definitely go again!
