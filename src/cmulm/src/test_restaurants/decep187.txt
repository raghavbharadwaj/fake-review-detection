I went to The Signature Room at the 95th last Friday for a relaxing dinner for two with my girlfriend and was greeted with impeccable service and hospitality from the wait staff. We sat down and ordered an appetizer and an entree each. For the appetizer, we had the Duck Trio. The duck thigh was cooked perfectly, but the toast points were a bit soggy. They must have been sitting out for a few before coming to the table. Other than that very minor detail, the rest of the appetizer was fantastic. For dinner I had the rack of lamb while my girlfriend had the petit filet. My lamb was cook perfectly. The lamb was juicy and full of flavor and the sides complimented the lamb just beautifully. I didn't have the chance to try the petit fillet myself, but my girlfriend absolutely loved it. For dessert, we shared the passionfruit cheesecake. It was light and fluffy and the crust was amazing. I would definitely go back and eat there again.
