This truly was an amazing highlight of our day on a rainy Chicago day. A very packed and happening place. We were worried this place would be over-hyped but it went far and beyond for the needs of foodies. We started with bread with duck fat butter and berry jam and it took off from there...bartenders were as unforgettable as the food. Each dish was perfect size for the two of us to share. We had several dishes like beet salad, grilled octopus, pig face, one of the goat dish specials, etc. We'd go back in a heartbeat.
