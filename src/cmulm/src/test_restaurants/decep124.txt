I visited the Chicago branch of Gibsons Bar & Seakhouse, I was very pleased with nearly thanks aspect. The servers were friendly and quick, atmosphere was quite, which I enjoyed very much and best of all the New York Sirloin was to die for. I would give the Chicago branch a 4/5, its a must go if you live in the area.
