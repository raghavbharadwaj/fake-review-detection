My wife and I visited Joe's during Labor Day Weekend 2011. We got a reservation a couple weeks in advance. Make sure to do that. When we got there at 5:30, they said they were booked til 9:30. I like to think of Joe's as a really formal place (casual business attire), but the food is pretty normal. Even though it was very pricy, it was a fun way to end our trip in Chicago.
