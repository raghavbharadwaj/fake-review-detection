Shaw's Crab House is a fantastic experience all-around. The service is excellent. Our waitress, Sandy or Sally, I can't remember, was extremely solicitous and seemed to magically appear any time we needed something. The food was delicious. I couldn't believe the amount of crab legs that were in an order! We had crab claws as an appetizer, and I did my famous crab claw routine to my daughter's embarrassment, but no one seemed to mind, management included, when I walked around the restaurant with crab claws dangling from my ears, nostrils, and mouth. Good sports. The atmosphere, too, is tremendously welcoming, and I love the fact that you can arm-wrestle the chef for a free meal. What a fun place! We'll be coming back for sure. I can't recommend Shaw's highly enough.
