Was in town for business & I think there were close to 30 of us that went out for a group dinner. We had a private room upstairs & walked through what I think was an ESPN radio show broadcasting live upstairs. Was decorated with lots of sports motif memorabilia, most of it of course featuring "da coach". For appetizers, all our tables shared an appetizer tower that included coconut shrimp, & liitle lamb chops. For my main, I had the bone in filet mignon ($49), my neighbour had the tuna (he said it was awesome) & I saw more than a couple bone in rib eyes happening. All you get is your piece of meat, so our server insisted that we order several sides (think we each chose 1) which we all passed around & shared. Meat was good (& quite alarge cut), sides were good, all in all quite good. For desert I ordered the chocolate cake & it was massive too, easily enough to share with 4, & we shared it amongst 8 I think. It's a kinda celebrity vanity type of place, I'm told Ditka is there quiite often, & he did make a point of coming into our room after our dinner & thanking us for coming in which was nice. A bunch of people in our group took his picture, he wasn't exactly kissing babies, but he did stay for a minute or two before leaving us.
