Recently, I discovered an amazing Chicago restaurant, Gibson's Bar & Steakhouse. I had heard of this restaurant and its good reputation, but hadn't had the opportunity to check it out until now. Wow! I am now a huge fan. Not only were the portions generous, but all parts of the meal were done to perfection. My martini was much larger than usual. I also really appreciated the dress code...anything other than sleeveless shirts for men are permitted although many men were dressed in shirts and others in jeans. I found the valet parking especially important in downtown Chicago. I am now a huge fan of this unique and classy restaurant and can't wait for my next visit with that special someone.
