Great place, great environment, great service. I enjoyed my time at the Purple Pig and I will return soon. It may be cliche to say, but all of the wasted time spent at other restaurants is painful to think about. Being an adventurous soul, I ordered the Calamari. I have never tried it and The Purple Pig delivered. This was an attractive and appetizing plate with a taste that did not disappoint. The staff were helpful, prompt and proper. I will return again soon.
