Ditka's in Chicago has certainly impressed me. Usually when I take the time to write a review its because I am extremely unhappy. The food was nearly inedible, the wait staff spilled a drink on my wife "accidentally" or the roach in the potatoes was the only thing appetizing. None of this happened at Ditka`s in Chicago. It never will happen either as the food is of the highest quality. I had Dry-Aged Angus Prime Rib with Mike's Fries. I wanted the most All American meal I could order and that was it. I wolfed it down like William Perry circa 1985 and I will say it was the greatest piece of meat I have ever had in my life. The potatoes were like a touchdown in my mouth with every bite. Ditka`s is truly the Super Bowl of food and the winner is you. I wish I had saved room for Overtime as I imagine their dessert is as good as the entree. I will definitely be back at the Goaline at Ditka`s for another Championship Dinner.
