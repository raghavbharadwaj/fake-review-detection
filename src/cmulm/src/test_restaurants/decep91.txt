What a find!!! While vacationing with my husband in Chicago over Father's Day (June 16, 2013), we decided to venture into new territory! We visited the Frontera Grill Diner. This is definitely a "award winning" establishment. The food was spectacular! I experienced the Frontera Grill Dinner - a "Live Fire Entree"! Garlic-marinated Gulf mahimahi, hoja santa crema (poblano, masa). Queso ai+-ejo mashed potatoes, arugula salad, spicy hoja santa tostada. It was the absolute BEST! Kudos to the staff, as well! Although the restaurant was busy, we were seated very quickly, and the waiter took very good care of us - he made us feel like we were his only patrons!! The only downside to the Frontera Grill Diner? Too many delicious things to choose from. It will take a lot of trips to try everything! We WILL BE BACK, Frontera!!! Cheers!!!
