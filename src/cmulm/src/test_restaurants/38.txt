Had a very nice meal there. It was our first night out in Chicago, and we'd gone there on the hotel concierge's recommendation. The waiter was very warm and friendly. I had no idea how expensive steaks are in Chicago, so I had the hamburger and my daughters had one portion of fish and chips between the two of them (they are 11 and 13). Their portion was so big they had leftovers. I now wish I'd bitten the bullet and tried a Chicago steak not because the burger wasn't good, but because I didn't try what the Midwest is famous for. I can't say our food was remarkable, but I'm afraid I found eating out in Chicago to be disappointing in general. I would return to Mike DItka's though if I had a bigger budget.
