Slight disappointment if I'm honest. Food was great and very professionally served. You just didn't feel like you were a special customer to them. Our servers were very rushed and abrupt. And although I had requested a decent view as it was our honeymoon they put us in the middle of the room at the corner which looks out at the lake. It was after sunset so basically all we could see was black. We might as well have been on the ground. People are only really going to eat here because of the views so it's a shame that some seats have no views at all. Maybe you have to tip the MaitreD hugely to get them. Maybe its luck of the draw and we were just unlucky.
