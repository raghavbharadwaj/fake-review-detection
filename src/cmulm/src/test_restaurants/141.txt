My son and I were in Chicago for the wk end and with luck got a Fri night reservation! The service was WONDERFUL, the manager even took time to stop by our table and chat. More surprising, the Chef took a few minutes to speak with us!! Everything we ate was memorable. We had the wood fired oysters, fried oysters, green beans, scallops and grilled chicken with the fried pickles. The rhubarb dessert was the perfect end to our experience! If we went back we would both find it hard to try other items as we so enjoyed everything we were served. Be aware that the restaurant is loud, but it is filled with happy diners enjoying food and "drink".......we did NOT find that a problem. And, speaking of "drink", be sure to check out their specialty drinks....... inventive and refreshing .
