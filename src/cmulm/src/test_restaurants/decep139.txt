My wife and I visited Gibsons for our anniversary dinner. It was our first time eating at the restaurant. We were able to make reservations through their website without having to call in. When we arrived at the restaurant we found that the only parking available was valet. I wouldn't have minded if the charge was fair, but the $14 fee before tip was a bit too much for my liking. Once we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly by a friendly hostess. Our waiter was quick to take out drink order and bring over glasses of water. We both had the house wine, which was decent. A bit too dry for my taste, but drinkable. We ordered Filet Mignon as our appetizer. My wife had the 10oz, I had the 14oz. The steaks came out in a timely fashion and were cooked exactly as ordered. The meat itself was tender, flavorful without being overbearing. I enjoyed the garlic mashed potato sides and asparagus. The portions were large enough that would could not have even considered desert. Overall, the experience was positive. The food was good and worth the price. The valet parking was a bit too expensive, but the food and service more than made up for it.We would definitely return.
