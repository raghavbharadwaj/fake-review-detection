The steak was a good piece of meat, but it wasn't seasoned at all. The salads and sides were pretty ordinary and quite over priced, I thought.My husband had Salmon and said it was marginal. I won't return with so many other options in Chicago. We really liked Fish Bar for lunch and Wild Fire (We didn't order steaks at Wild Fire though because we knew we were going to Gibson's). Definitely didn't live up to the hype.
