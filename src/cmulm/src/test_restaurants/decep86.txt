I recently moved from Austin to Chicago about 6 months ago and I was starting to really miss some good ol' tex mex food. A friend and I found Frontera online with some good reviews so we decided to give it a shot. That was probably the best decision I made all week. The wait staff was very friendly and everything we ordered came out quickly. I got the carbon tacos and they were delicious. Exactly what I needed to bring be back home for an evening.
