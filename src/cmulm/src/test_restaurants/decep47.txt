I had read plenty about this restaurant in various restaurant reviews including Time Out Chicago and the Chicago Tribune. I was a bit hesitant because sometimes they never live up to the hype. But, I have to admit, the Purple Pig is really fantastic. First, the atmosphere is very tasteful, decorated with nice colors, and even the dishes are in the shape of pigs. The food was just fantastic. I was a bit overwhelmed by the choices of cheeses and wines, but our server was very knowledgeable and helped us to get match our wines with out meals and to choose some of the more popular dishes. I look forward to going back and trying some of the salads, which also looked amazing. And, when we left, we realized there is some outdoor seating for when the weather is good! Can't wait to return!
