Where do I start? The Purple Pig is absolutely incredible seems about right. I first went with a couple of coworkers for dinner on a Friday night and felt as if I stumbled upon a gold mine. Its location is perfect for taking a client or a date. The Good Stuff: - The food is delicious. I have yet to try something I did not like. - The "plating" is done with great care and is incredibly appealing. - The wait staff is professional with the perfect amount of friendliness. - Dessert! Unbelievable! Don't skip dessert! The bad: - What do I write? I have yet to find anything bad! The Purple Pig is awesome. Try it. You'll understand.
