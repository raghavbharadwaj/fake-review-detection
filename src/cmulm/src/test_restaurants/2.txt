I have eaten at Joe's a couple of times this year, always for dinner. This past trip in August, I happened to get out of my meeting a little early, and as I strolled by Joe's I just couldn't resist heading inside for some of my favorite food! I had planned on getting one of the any delicious seafood dishes with one of their classic wedge salads, but after seeing another diner completely devour an amazing looking burger, I had to change course. I'm so glad I did...What a burger! Three different kinds of beef ground freshly into a 1/2 LB. burger, cooked medium and seasoned so perfectly as Joe's knows how to do. Fresh toppings, and hand cut fries rounded out what ended up being a perfect lunch.
