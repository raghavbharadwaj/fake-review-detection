Amazing but expect a 2 hour wait. The food was deadly, in a good way for your taste buds but not for your heart. The place had a nice comfortable relaxed but busy, unpretentious atmosphere. The waiter was helpful with some wine pairing. I had the octopus which was perfectly done skewered so it cooked evenly, not rubbery at all the perfect texture never had better. Than I had the homemade headcheese and a nice aged piave, than the bone marrow smear with homemade bread. While I was eating this the waiter had thought I ordered a JLT jowl lettuce and tomato sandwich with a perfectly cooked egg on top, how could I refuse, I was deciding weather to get it but had not ordered it when you see that beautiful specimen of a sandwich how can you resist. So after eating pretty well through all of my gastronomic symphony I decided to blend a couple of heavenly morsels together. First the toasted homemade bread than then marrow smear, next the headcheese, than onto the pork jowl, and lastly the heart attack before I even took a bite, like those people that die before they hit the ground. (No real heart attack but you can definitely feel the palpitations). The richest mouthful of food I think I ever had. What a meal the top of my list in Chicago. Adios amigos!
