This was our first visit to Shaw's and certainly won't be our last, now that our daughter and husband live in Chicago. The menu is mouth-watering. We both ordered the lobster thermidour and it was delicious. Our waiter was Dick J., a 20 year employee with a truly engaging personality, and detailed knowledge of the menu choices. The service was impeccable,and drinks ice cold. The place is pricey, but well worth the expense. Please call the day before you want to eat there to get a good time. as it is very popular. We booked our reservation before noon, through Open Table, and only 5:45pm and 8pm were available so we chose the 5:45 seating. By the time we left, the lobby was filled with diners waiting for their tables. You will not be disappointed dining at Shaw's.
