My boyfriend had been wanting to try Mike Ditka's for a while, so I finally agreed to go. The restaurant is clean and has a nice atmosphere. We didn't have to wait long to be given a table and our food arrived right away. I had the crispy tuna avacado roll, while my boyfriend had the prime ribs. The food was amazing! It was fresh and was well prepared. My boyfriend said his ribs were cooked perfectly. The meal was affordable and the whole experience was good. I definitely plan to come back.
