My wife and I had dinner here the Sunday night before Christmas. We had an early reservation (strongly recommend you have one) and were able to get a table next to the windows facing south. The view was terrific and we had a great time looking at the lights of the city. The atmosphere was nice but understand that you will see a cross section of patrons... families, business, couples... in casual to dressy. And it is a little loud at times... this is not an intimate location. The food was what I would expect from a good restaurant in Chicago, but nothing exceptional... there are better choices if the food is your top priority. The wait staff was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Dine here if you want the fun and the event of the location, and a decent meal on the side.
