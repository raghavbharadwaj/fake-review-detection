Instead of waiting for hours to get on top of Willis Tower (which can take up to 3 hrs!) or Hancock Observatory I recommend to have a drink at the Signature Room or lounge. On the 95th and 96th floor of the Hancock Tower visitors can enjoy dinner or just a drink that comes with a jaw-dropping view over Chicago's skyline and vicinity. The costs for a drink or admission to the lookouts is pretty much the same with the difference that your waiting time is much less and you get some booze on top. During the weekend it can happen that both the restaurant and bar are packed but since the drinks are quite expensive most people don't stay long in the bar. Besides, you are allowed to take taking pictures on the 96th floor without having a drink, at least they do not disturb you. I once had drinks at the bar and just recently the chance to attend a reception in the restaurant and both drinks and food were pretty good. Average entree: $35 Cocktails, average: $14 + jaw-dropping view, + delicious Modern American fare, - packed, - expensive
