Ah, Gibsons. Where do I begin? I began the day weeping gently in my cheap hotel room, desperately eating a Klondike bar, trying to fill the hole in my soul. After waking up at noon from a drug and alcohol induced coma, I wandered over to Gibson's, where I found the greatest steak I have ever eaten. Perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, yet not too rare. The seasonings were excellent. As I sat down in this delicately lit, perfectly equipped with ambient music, I felt myself re-inflate mentally. I ordered quickly and quietly, avoiding the server's respectful downward gaze by using one of my own. When my Tanqueray and Tonic arrived, it was excellent: Genuine Tanqueray, about 50-50 tonic and Tanqueray, extra lime jsut how I like it. As I was half through my drink, the steak arrived with fresh, crisp veggies (steamed, not boiled) and moist mashed potatoes with a generous splash of gravy over them. As I picked up my knife and fork, I almost felt human again. At the end of my meal and my drink, I felt certainly human, and ready for another night with "Frank" and "The Director" as Phil Collins plays in the background. Until this shoot is done, I will be coming back here - nightly.
