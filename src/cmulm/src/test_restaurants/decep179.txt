Quartino is definitely one of our favorite restaurants. When the weather is nice, there is nothing better than sitting on the balcony. The wait staff always has a smile and very helpful. I never once had to ask for a refill on my drink, they were really on top of the service. The food was amazing. The menu has a lot of options for everyone to find something they like. We will be going back very soon.
