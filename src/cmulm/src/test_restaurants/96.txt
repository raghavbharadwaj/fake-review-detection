The DH and I visited Topolobampo in December and loved it. Yes, the food and drinks are on the expensive side, but I think it's well worth the visit for those special occassions. As far as Frontera Grill, we just visited this past weekend and only have positive things to say about it as well. We didn't make a reservation, but got there early enough, or at least I thought, and had to wait an hour and a half to be seated. On the plus side, and if you enjoy beer/wine/cocktails, they have an awesome bar. We had a great time while waiting to be seated - ordered margaritas and the guacamole appetizer. Now, one thing to note about their drinks, they are so tasty, but itty bitty. The drink prices start around $10, not worth how small they are. As far as what we ordered once seated, we chose the steak tacos and mole chicken enchiladas - so good and on the inexpensive side compared to the rest of the menu. Overall, we had a great time and will likely return to Frontera Grill before Topolobampo.
