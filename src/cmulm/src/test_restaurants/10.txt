My wife and I made reservations a month in advance as we had heard that tables were tough to come by here. Having eaten the food, I can see why. We each had a large stone crab appetizer and I'm here to tell you stone crab claws are the most sweet and succulent sea creature I've ever eaten. Joe's serves them with a mustard dipping sauce that is to die for. The stone crabs alone are enough to get me to come back. I ordered king crab legs for my entree. I so rarely get crab legs, so few places do them well where I live so for me they're a treat. Joe's did not disappoint, they were big, meaty and delicious. My wife ordered scallops which were perfectly prepared and seasoned. On the negative side, the service wasn't all that good. Our waiter treated us as though we were idiots who just fell off the turnip truck. We had ordered desert and when it arrived the waiter brought our check. Halfway through our desert the waiter stopped back to see if we had put cash or a credit card out for him. Upon discovering that we had not yet, the waiter than stood 15 feet away and watched us until I put my credit card out. It was as though he thought we were going to take off without paying. I'm a lawyer in my 30's but apparently this waiter thinks I look like the type to leave without paying. Ridiculous. I won't let a bad waiter spoil my meal though. Joe's is worth going to for the stone crabs alone. Just ignore the waiters who believe all their customers are crooks.
