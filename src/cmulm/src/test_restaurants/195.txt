Have had many meals here, my most recent during the last weekend of August 2011. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant mostly for the view, but the food is also very good. Brunch or lunch buffet is highly recommended. Service has always been great, even on the upper floor lounge area, where they allow you to just relax and take it all in. Definitely make reservations. I have always had the buffet with champagne. Everything is always very good, from the salmon to the desserts and meat carving stations. I have also entertained clients and family here several times. Yes, it's not cheap, but you are paying for the experience/view as well---and it's the best restaurant view in the entire city. This most recent time, we got a variety of foods/drinks for lunch. Dips, sandwiches, and appetizers shared by the table were all wonderful. They were very prompt and tasted great. Our wine, cocktails and coffee were also prompt and tasty. We didn't spend too much time checking out the atmosphere inside the restaurant because we were focused on the awesome view. Would definitely recommend this for special occasions or for impressing people. Do not recommend for families with young kids or large groups.
