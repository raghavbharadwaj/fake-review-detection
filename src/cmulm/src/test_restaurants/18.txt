We came across this when we ran a search on tripadvisor for restaurants in Chicago and have to say that we were not disappointed in the quality of food and service at this fine restaurant. We made a reservation a month in advance for 8pm on a Monday night but my friend managed to get a different table for 8:30pm the very same evening so there could be better availability on weekdays. The restaurant looked fairly busy when we arrived, empty tables were not obvious. We were promptly shown to our table and our server was very helpful with recommendations. My 2 friends had the 'surf and turf' combo for around $55 - Alaskan king crab legs (pre-peeled for your delectation) and a cut of beef, and I had the dover sole for around $43 and the crab soup ($8) which was simply sublime. I would say the king crab legs are definitely not to be missed (for a much cheaper option in a trashy diner setting, look up Half Shell). The restaurant was filled with a business-looking crowd so definitely a more upper class setting. Ideal for dates, business dinners or catching up with a group of friends. Service and ambience were excellent - I'd highly recommend it if you don't mind splashing out on a meal!
