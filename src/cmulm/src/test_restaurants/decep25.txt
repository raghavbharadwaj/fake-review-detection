Being a big football Chicago Bears, my friends and I decided to go to Mike Ditka's - Chicago. Wow, we were amazed by this place! We went and had dinner at 8:00pm on a Friday night, I called and made reservations ahead of time. We started with drinks, I am a big fan of Moscow Mule's. This one did not disappoint me at all! The server was great, from drinks to dinner she was very helpful! We started appetizers with the Calamari, and for the first time I had it Rhode Island Style. I cant say that I'm a big fan of this, but it was great to try something new. I then had the prime meatloaf stack, being from the south I love meatloaf! This was so good, that I had to take a picture and post it on Facebook...YUM! Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well. All and all this was a 5/5 experience, and I will differently come back!
