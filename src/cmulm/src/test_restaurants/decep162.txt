The Girl and the Goat restaurant is easily one of my all time favorite places to eat. I absolutely love inviting a few friends out to have a good time and enjoy some awesome food. The atmosphere is very chic beautiful, just looking around the place is like having a blast! Personally, I highly recommend the green garlic potato wontons, they are so delicious and you'll want to take a few home for later! Between the food, the drinks and the place itself, you will quickly become a fan.
