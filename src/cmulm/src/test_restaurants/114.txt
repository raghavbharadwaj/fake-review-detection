I know that this place has great food for lunch and dinner, but they also have a great breakfast buffet. They provide a buffet line with meats and eggs, as well as sausage gravy, etc. They will make to order omelets, waffles with different toppings, or french toast as part of the buffet, and there are a bevy of cold selections, as well as bagels, breads, and muffins, fruit, and yogurts, and so on. Reasonably priced, but probably not the cheapest one in town. Did not make a reservation, and had no trouble getting seated on a saturday morning at 9am...
