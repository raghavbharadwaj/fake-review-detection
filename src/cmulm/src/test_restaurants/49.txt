The catchy name stuck with me after reading several favourable reviews so when we happened to pass by on a rainy Saturday afternoon, we jumped at the chance to give it a try. We were not disappointed. From the moment we moved into a tentlike patio area, we felt welcomed. We were able to get a table for two but would have happly sat at one of the long community ones. Even though the place was bustling, our server took the time to explain the menu and helped us choose a wine by letting us taste it first. They also served water in lovely old fashioned bottles which they refilled regularly. It's the type of place where you chat with people at neighbouring tables and so many of them were local, repeat customers. We watched as each dish was brought out - they were served one or two at a time, sort of like tapas, family style. We ordered 5 plates and were not disappointed in the least. We had a couple of antipasto dishes - a bowl of braised baby artichokes, fingerling potatoes, asiago and salami and the calamari plate . Both were delicious but I wish we had a bit of bread to wipe our plates clean! Next we had a caslefrank, sunchoke and hazelnut salad with a tasty apple vinaigrette - ditto about the bread. I did ask but none appeared. That was okay because I really didn't need the extra carbs. Next we enjoyed an order of Jimmy's house sausage and some fried sardines. We finished off with a perfected prepared machiatto.
