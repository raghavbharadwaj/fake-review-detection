The Signature Room is on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Building, and although I'm not one for heights, I soon forgot about that, looking down at the bright lights of Chicago. The restaurant is comfortable and cozy with it's wood decor, and the service was fast and friendly, the restaurant being family-owned. I ordered the Filet of Beef, which was worth every penny ($50) and was made even more mouth-watering by the side dish of Roasted Mushrooms and Truffles Vinaigrette I ordered($5). The potato galette, wild greens salad, and oxtail pot-au-feu that came with the steak was really something to remember, and went well with the fine bottle of Beaujolais. (My mother was a waitress for 35 years, and I could find nothing to complain about, and always leave a 15% tip.) This is a great place to bring a date or larger party to make an impression not soon forgotten!
