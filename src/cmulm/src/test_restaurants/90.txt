We enjoyed our 5 Prix fix menu tasting. While I would not order some of what came up, I really enjoyed trying things outside my scope. Rick Bayless was sitting next to us, sampling his own menu, which I thought was cool. I felt the service was a bit slow (there for 2.5 hours), I imagine they don't want to sacrifice quality for speed so I sort of understand. It is very expensive, but worth it once in awhile! Margarita's are great!
