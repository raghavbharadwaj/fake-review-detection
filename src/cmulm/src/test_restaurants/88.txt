We had a wonderful meal at Topolobampo. Reservations are essential (I made them 2 or 3 weeks in advance). We were seated promptly and our waiter was friendly and charming. His explanations were sometimes excessively long (for example, I asked about a particular species of fish on the menu, and was rewarded with a 10 minute dissertation on a variety of subjects, including that fish and 5 or 6 other menu items I hadn't asked about and wasn't interested in). The service was otherwise perfection itself. The menu items bear no resemblance to the typical Tex-Mex restaurant menu, and you can see the current menu on the restaurant's website. Everything was fresh, meticulously presented, and the blends of flavors worked well. I ordered to Chef's tasting menu; the portion sizes were a little larger than typical tasting portions, and they were organized to present flavors of increasing richness and complexity.
