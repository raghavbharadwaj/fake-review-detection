Whether you are tourist looking to venture the Chicago nightlife, or an elegant seafood joint, Shaw's Crab House brings you the best of both worlds. Located near the Chicago Harbor, the restaurant is found near beautiful Chicago seaside. With a menu that ranges from soups, steaks, crab, and the best oysters in town, there is no better place to dine quality food at an unbeatable price. Born in the San Francisco Bay Area, i have had my fair share of seafood a the piers, but, I can easily say that it feels good to have great tasting seafood out on the east coast.Thank you Shaw's Crab House for the great experience and will definitely return next time i come to the windy city.
