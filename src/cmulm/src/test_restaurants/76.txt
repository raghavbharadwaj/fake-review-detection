We ordered three-course crab dinner for two, and it was a lot of really good food. My wife had clam chowder, and said it was awesome. However, I can't imagine it was as good as my lobster bisque. It was the best soup I have ever had. For the main course, we had three different kinds of crab (dungess, Alaskan, and crab cakes). The crab cakes were okay, but the other crabs were incredibly meeting and outstandingly tasty. We also were served au gratin potatoes, creamed spinach, and cole slaw. All were fine and dandy, but let's face it: it's really not what you go there for. Our entree came with a dessert. We both chose the recommended key lime pie. It was good and it was large. My wife drank a triple berry mojito and liked it. While pricey, the food was worth it, but not really a bargain, just really good. The service was good, especially the bus boy. I do like it, though, when the server asks how the meal is within a couple minutes. That didn't happen, but nothing was wrong anyway.
