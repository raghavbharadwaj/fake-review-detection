Someone from Chicago recommended this restaurant to my husband and are we glad they did!! There were 7 of us and we all felt the same way. We did have reservations - glad we did otherwise it would have been a long wait. Generous portions on the main course (meat) but we felt the sides were a little skimpy - won't stop us from returning if we are in Chicago though. I had 3 large slices of the meatloaf - shared with the others to try and we all agreed it was the best meatloaf we had ever had! Our waitress started out a little "short" with us, but got friendlier as the meal progressed. Other than that, the service was very good and friendly.
