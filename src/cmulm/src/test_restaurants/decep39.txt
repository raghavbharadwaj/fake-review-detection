I took my wife to dinner last Friday at Ditkaao>>s in Chicago. The place was busy, but the staff was on top of it and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server was friendly (sorry, I forgot her name) and had our drinks quickly. My wife had the Maryland Style Crab Cakes and she says they are the best she has ever had. I had the huge Ditka Cut Bone-in Angus Prime Rib. Not only was it big, but it had to be the best prime rib I've had in a very long time. The food and service rates a solid 10 while the atmosphere was closer to a 9. The prices are on the steep side, but it was well worth it.
