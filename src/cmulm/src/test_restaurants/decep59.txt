I was very impressed with The Purple Pig. The food was delicious, we had Antipasti, with Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic which melted in your mouth. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys eating good food in a great restaurant. The service was excellent, fast and friendly and the price was just right. You won't be sorry that you stopped at "The Purple Pig" to eat!
