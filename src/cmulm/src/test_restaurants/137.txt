Was in Chicago for a convention and arranged to meet an old friend here. Classic steak house. Large portions and even larger prices. Entrees are all on the higher end of the $15-80 tag listed on TripAdvisor. Cheapest steak on the menu was around $40. The lobster tails were huge, including the largest I had ever seen, and while probably good for two was priced at $115 ! Salads were fresh and tasty, and the Baked potato was large enough to share. Waiter was attentive and knowledgable, but conveyed unhappiness via body language when we didn't order drinks or dessert and run the tab even higher. Overall: great for the experience, or special occasion, but not for a steady diet.
