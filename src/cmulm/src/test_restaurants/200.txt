The Signature Room 95 or the Signature Lounge 96 is THE place to enjoy the amazing aerial panoramic view of Chicago without the hassle of going through security check-ins and the crowd like that at the Sears Tower. We visited the lounge late at night and we didn't have to wait for a table. However, we did have to wait for a table by the window, which was about roughly 15 mins. The view is amazing especially at night time when the entire Chicago is all lit up. The lounge offers a short list of food snacks, cocktails, wine and non-alcoholic beverages. Though the snacks tend to be on the pricier side, the price is well worth it for the picturesque panoramic view you get. For the ladies out there, you are also privileged to the best view at the Signature Room/Lounge, which is from the ladies room (surprisingly). From there, you are directly facing the Sears Tower and the view is absolutely amazing.
