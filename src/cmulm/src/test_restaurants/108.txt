We choose the Weber Grill due to it having a great outdoor eating area. We arrived at 8 PM on a Sunday night and were seated within 5 minutes. I believe this was in error however as there were couples/families that appeared to be waiting longer than us. But, I won't complain about that! Had a great table outside. I had the veggie burger and my husband had the beer can chicken. Both meals were excellent. The garlic mashed potato's were the best we've ever had. Meal with 4 alcoholic drinks came to about $50+tip which is very reasonable for Chicago. I've eaten at restaurants in Chicago and have paid over $100 for my meal and regretted it. If you want great food and don't want to overspend, goto the Weber Grill.
