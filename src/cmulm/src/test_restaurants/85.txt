We visited this restaurant with our 8 month old son on a Friday evening for an early dinner. They were very accomodating and helped us get seated almost right away. The atmosphere is very warm, with bright colors & wonderful art everywhere. Our meals were better than we expected. I recommend the Empanadas--they tasted fabulous! The avocados were the freshed I've ever eaten at a restaurant. This is a place you could bring the whole family, but I'd also recommend it for a date night too. We'll definately visit again the next time we visit Chicago, with or without the kids.
