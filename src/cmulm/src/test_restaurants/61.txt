Went to Shaw's during a spring break Chicago weekend with family. Reservation was for 8:30 and we were seated by 8:50, the place was EXTREMELY busy on a Friday night. The bar was 3 deep, but the servers are expert, and we got drinks, stood by, and watched the traffic fly by. We were seated and immediately attended by our waitress, and she was perfection in advice and service the entire night. Water servers, stewards and the like are all very quick to refill, and after ordering the oyster sampler (YUM) and full size lobster tails and other goodies, we were eating as fast as we could want. The waitress checked on us often, and the food was dynamite! If you want intimate quiet dining, go elsewhere, this is a large place with a raucous Chicago crowd and GREAT food! We will be going back for the oyster bar lunch counter experience.
