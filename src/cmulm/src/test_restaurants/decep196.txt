My husband and I love coming to the Signature room at the 95th. It has a wonderful atmosphere of professionalism and it's a great place for one to celebrate a number of occasions. The food is wonderful and beautiful. The Twin Lobster Tails are to die for! I recommend trying that if you haven't. The staff is extremely polite, courteous and just wonderful. This is a must if you're visiting the area.
