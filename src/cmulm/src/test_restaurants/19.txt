6 of us went around a week ago; we had a 7:30 and were seated around 7:45. I wasn't paying the bill so didn't pay that close of attention but the waiter suggested some appetizers of fresh crab legs and soft shell crabs "best in the city". They brought out too much food, there were even some left when our entrees arrived. We all ordered $40 meals, we all also shared 3 sides and 3 desserts plus one bottle of wine; nothing extravagant. I thought the bill was going to be around $500, low and behold it was $900; it turns out the 2 starters were $350! I know you guys are going to say it was our fault for not asking and you would be correct but to suggest $350 in starters and not warn us was in my opinion a bit much plus the waiter put his tip (18%) on the bill so I suspect he was a bit nervious.
