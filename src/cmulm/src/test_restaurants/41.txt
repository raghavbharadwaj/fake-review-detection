We ordered five of the small-plate offerings: Charred cauliflower with cornichons was tart and luscious; prosciutto bread balls were bathed in a tasty, lively sauce; grilled scallops were large and succulent; pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - the ultimate comfort food. And then we had an order of some kind of cured meat, which turned out to be a few nickel-sized slivers, no bread, no crackers, hardly a mouthful. Why bother? On balance, I'd recommend the place but beg the management to make the menu more user-friendly by explaining the dishes a little more clearly. Although our server cheerfully answered our numerous questions, it really would have helped us compose our meal better and more quickly if we just could have read it up front: (i.e. -- what's the "tartufo," what's a "spiedini," what's "a la plancha," etc. etc.) Nice lunch, anyway.
