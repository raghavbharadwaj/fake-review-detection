What a great find! I went to this restaurant with my hubby yesterday and was totally satisfied. The decor was whimsical and fun. The wine list was extensive and the wait staff knowledgable about it. And the food...it was really amazing. We had the chorizo stuffed olives, which were savory and delicious, along with an assortment of cured meats and cheeses the waiter suggested. Then, we shared the clams. They were sooo good, especially sopping up the juices with the rustic bread. I really wanted to try the lemon panna cotta, but I was so full it just wasn't an option. I will definitely get it the next time I go, though, which will be very soon!
