Quite simply one of the best meals I have ever had. Being from an area with a lot of good restaurants, I am not that easily impressed with many out of town restaurants. This one is just great. It has granduer and elegance without being stuffy or pretentious. The food is amazing. My wife and I had the crabmeat cocktail, shrimp cocktail, and some interesting sushi rolls to start. I had a surf & turf and she had a clam chowder. All were perfect. Eating here, you would think you were on the ocean in Maine or Cape Cod with how fresh the seafood and fish are. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone. What a great experience.
