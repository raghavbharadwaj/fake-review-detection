I started my evening out with an appetizer. I went with the broccoli with roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette. It had the perfect amount of flavor and balance. I ended my night with Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin Breadcrumbs. I was recommended this dish and it delivered. The pork tripe was cooked to perfection which bares repeating because it is easily messed up. The service was great, our server was very helpful and accommodating.
