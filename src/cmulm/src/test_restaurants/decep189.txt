I would rate this restaurant a 4 out of 5. I went here for a romantic dinner last week with my wife. The view is breathtaking, and the food is just as spectacular. We started our night off with the Grilled Shrimp appetizer. Simply amazing. I then ordered the Wagyu Manhattan Strip Steak and my wife ordered the Petit Filet. We both enjoyed our meal, and found it to be quite a delicious experience. Oh, and I forgot to mention the service. Boy, these people sure are friendly. And they're quick too. I would definitely go to this restaurant again for a special occasion. Thank you Signature Room at the 95th for this lovely experience!
