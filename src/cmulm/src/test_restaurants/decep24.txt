Ditka's restaurant was a delightful experience. The entrance to this restaurant was very inviting and the staff welcomed us with a smiled.The servers are professional and worked in a timely matter to receive our orders. The menus had clear images that were enticing to my appetite. I ordered the BBQ baby back ribs that were mouth watering. They were falling off the bone. They were sweet and tender. Cooked to perfection. My side order of spinach salad was a fresh delight. It contained crunchy bacon and slices of egg, and sweet slices of apples. The ambiance in this restaurant was great,subtle music playing in the back ground, people laughing and conversing.The food was delicious and service outstanding with servers always checking in to see if we needed anything. A great experience and will be coming back again.
