I have gone to Mike Ditka's Chicago with a couple of friends and boy, didn't I imagine it would be more than a blast! I enjoyed the ambiance- it was friendly and at the same time classy. You cannot define the word class, but you can definitely go to one. They offer private dining, which is my next target visit. Once will never be enough for an outstanding experience.
