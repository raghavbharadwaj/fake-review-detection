The first time that my husband and I came to dine at Quartino, was for our Saturday date night.We pick a different restaurant to check out on the last Saturday of every month. This time we had decided on finding something delightful in the downtown area of Chicago. I had heard great things about Quartino's menu from friends and we are both always very eager to try new places, especially because we both love Italian food so much. We are both pretty good cooks, and we loved getting inspired by eating out. On our first night dinning at Quartino's I decided that I would only try they vegetarian dishes while my husband would try a meat dish as a main menu, and we would share the appetizers. The restaurant was packed on Saturday night, brimming with lively chatter and a mixture of delicious aromas. We felt immediately at ease as we were seated by our served. We started off with the white bean and garlic spread, the chilled zucchini and polenta fries which we had to order a second round of! They were absolutely incredible! We also ended up finishing a bottle of delicious Itlaian wine with dinner. I had the mouthwatering, homemade gnocchi and my husband had beef short ribs. We were both in heaven and I though I wanted to not eat meat, I had to try the short ribs, and they were well worth it! The ambiance was warm and welcoming, the food incredibly delicious and our check was very, very reasonable. Quartino has quickly become one of our favorite places to dine out in Chicago and we love sharing it with friends.
