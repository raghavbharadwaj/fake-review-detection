Yum! Such a great place to dine for a succulent and nicely priced meal! Not only was the food absolutely to die for, I had the green garlic potato wontons, but the atmosphere was nothing short from ideal. The service was incredibly friendly and the meal arrived very quickly. I give this place two thumbs up!
