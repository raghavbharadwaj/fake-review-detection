Our first night in the city and we were not sure what we wanted....so we started walking from our hotel and stubbled across the Quartino. We almost did not eat there...what a mistake that would have been. This a GREAT Italian restaurant that will not break your bank and you will leave extremely satisfied. There motto "Where the Wine is Cheaper Than Water...and the Pizza is The Finest." One feature is the wine. Each month they feature bottled wines that they price at $20.00/bottle. We had the Merlot one night and the Red Zin the other. Both were very tasty and this is coming from a couple of wine snobs. The food is designed to share. We had the Veal Osso Bucco. This is a MUST. We make a version at home and have yet to find one that we like better than ours and this one came very close. We also had the sausage Risotto and the romaine salad. Both good choices. We also had to have dessert. I can not remember the name, but it was vanilla Gelato, with bananas and chocolate...yummy! Over all with tip the dinner was $58 and some change. We went back one more night and had the pizza. We were not disappointed.
