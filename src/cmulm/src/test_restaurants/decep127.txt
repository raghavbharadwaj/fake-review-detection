I recently went to Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse in the Chicago area, and had an absolutely wonderful dining experience. I was seated promptly and the host was very friendly. My waitress came to my table rather quickly and told me about the specials of the day. I ordered a shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and it came out in a reasonable amount of time and was really delicious. The shrimp was seasoned perfectly and the cocktail sauce served was incredible. After my appetizer, I tried the New York Sirloin which was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. I ordered it medium-rare and the kitchen hit the mark perfectly. After a great dining experience at Gibsons, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for high quality food in the Chicago area. The prices were a little high, but the food is definitely worth it!
