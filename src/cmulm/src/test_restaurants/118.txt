this is a; busy, bustling, smiling, fabulous, slice of real America. Food was really really good (skirt steak a revelation!) and not just focused on steaks which pleased my good lady who had a lovely piece of fish. Starter taster plate (for 2) was excellent, and above all the service was 100%. So good we went back for lunch 2 days later.
