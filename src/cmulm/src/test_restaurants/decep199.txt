I took my wife to The Signature Room for our 10th anniversary dinner after hearing great reviews from a friend who dined here at a wedding reception. Turns out his recommendation was spot on! We were stunned by the views of the city and even more impressed by the service. The staff went out of their way to treat my wife like a queen after I tipped them off that it was our anniversary which made our night even more special. While the atmosphere alone was worth the trip, I can't review The Signature without mentioning the food! My beef filet was delicious and the oysters are the best we've found yet in Chicago. If you're deciding between side dishes, I HIGHLY recommend trying the black truffle potatoes. After sampling mine my wife wished she had decided to splurge and get some of her own instead of opting for a more standard vegetable dish. To sum up: If you are looking for a place to celebrate a special event with loved ones or friends, I think that The Signature is a top-notch restaurant choice that will undoubtedly do your celebration justice.
