My friend & I found Quartino's while out walking in the morning. The menu brought us back to eat there that evening. It was a Saturday night, very busy. We requested outdoor seating, the hostess guessed the wait to be one hour. It was very packed inside, but we got to the bar and ordered a bottle of wine. Our name was called in less than one hour. The waiter explained that the food comes out as ready. You share this dish, and wait for the next food item to arrive. We were not very hungry so we ordered a pizza to share. The pizza was fine, a simple thin crust with nice toppings. Similiar to what most italian restaurants serve. I think the share food concept would work great with a larger group (some people may not like this idea) my family & friends tend to do this when we eat out. The prices were very affordable for such a nice restaurant in a large city. Our bottle of wine was only $15, yes there was much higher wine, we were happy with our choice. I would return to this restaurant in a minute. If you don't want a heavy meal, there are plenty of small bites to choose.
