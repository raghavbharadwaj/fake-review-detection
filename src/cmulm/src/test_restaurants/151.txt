I took my girlfriend to Girl and the Goat for her birthday and we were both really excited about trying this often talked about restaurant. First impressions, really cool decor, table was ready for us immediately with our reservation time, and lively atmosphere. But, the food was why we came. I gave Girl and the Goat 4 stars instead of 5 because while some dishes were truly out of this world, others were just solid. My girlfriend and I ate what the waiter called, "an ambitious" ordering of plates because we wanted to try so many things. We did try a lot of different things from duck tongue to pork belly to kohlrabi salad. Seafood, carne, and everything in between. My girlfriend and I both thought that for the money, Girl and the Goat was worth it. It did not break the bank, but was not exactly cheap either. I would totally recommend Girl and the Goat, but as far as fine dining in Chicago, I do not think it is quite 5 star, perhaps if we ordered different items it would have been. Highlights: Porkbelly, Kohlrabi salad, sweet bread (if you don't order this, you are a fool), Baby Octopus Not so highlights: Duck tongue (this was our gamble dish and it did not pay off=worst dish of the night), ceviche (I love ceviche, lived in Latin America for two years, and while this was not bad ceviche by any means, it was not outstanding either) Final note... The service was outstanding, one of the best waitresses I have ever had in a restaurant... funny, engaging, knew when to walk away and leave us alone and when we wanted to chat... I wish I could remember her name, but she was FANTASTIC!
