A group of us tried this place this week based on trip advisor. We couldn't book a table and so we sent in an advance party to reserve a table for 8, we arrived about 20 mins later and in total we waited over an hour for the table, but they kept us adequately supplied with the drinks. AND BOY was it worth the wait, we sat outside under the heaters and were looked after by Ryan, we told him we would go with his recommendations and he just kept the dishes coming, every dish different, every dish hitting the spot. The food flavours were fantastic. My only downer is I think they pack too many people in and getting people to wait around means they are hanging around the diner's personal space a bit too close. Nevertheless, great experience.
