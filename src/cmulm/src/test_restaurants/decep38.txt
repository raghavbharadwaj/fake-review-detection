When I heard that Mike Ditka was opening a steakhouse, I knew I had to try it. The man is a legend in Chicago and is known for giving 100% to whatever he puts his time in. When I went in the restaurant I really liked what I saw. It was a very relaxed place, not too loud and not too quiet. The people and the staff were friendly as well so my initial impressions were good. But at the end it is all about the food. The steaks were great, my order was on time, and I had a really good time. I recommend anyone who likes good steak to check the place out!
