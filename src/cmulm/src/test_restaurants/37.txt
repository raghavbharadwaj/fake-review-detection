We spent the Friday and Saturday in Chicago before we went to Indy for the Super Bowl and we decided on Friday night we should start at Ditka's. We were very happy we did. Everyone in the restaurant was very friendly. We had a short wait at bar before we were seated. We did not have reservation and we were seated on a Friday night in less than 20 minutes. I had the chopped salad and the ribs. Both were great. The ribs had a little kick to them but I liked that so it made me enjoy them even more. The portions were very big. I usally an able to finish anything put on my plate but I was not able to finish the ribs. We enjoyed the restaurant so much that we decided to return on Saturday night. On Saturday I had Da Pork Chops and they were also great. My friends had different steaks and everyone enjoyed their meals. We also loved all the sports pictures that are hanging throughout the restaurant. Ditkas was a great start to a super weekend.
