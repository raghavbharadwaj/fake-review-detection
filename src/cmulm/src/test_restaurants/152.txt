Okay so the place had a three month wait and we just got to Chicago and decided we wanted to give it a shot. The concierge at our hotel said that sometimes they have seating for walk-ins that come early. We got there at around 6 o'clock parked on valet parking spot for $10 and walked right into the front right next to the kitchen. In many restaurants being next to the kitchen is not a good thing this place hasn't totally open kitchen sink and see everything there cooking bother doing it it's an amazing ambience! My husband and I sat with a group of another six people at a huge dining room table made of old beautiful wood and had the best night I can remember in a long time. We had three appetizers two main courses I side dish and dessert beer and wine and the whole bill was $85! We're actually going to go back again tomorrow night because the food was on believable and delicious every single thing we ate was flawless. I'm a foodie but my husband is not and I've never been out to a restaurant with him were all he kept saying over and over again is oh my God!
