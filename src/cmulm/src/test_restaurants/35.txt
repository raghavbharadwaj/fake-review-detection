Attended in June with three adults and three kids (11, 9, and 5). Our 11 year old does not always get enough to eat when ordering from kids menus. Not a problem here. Grilled cheese and fries is adult sized. Kids burger (two slider sized with fries) and chicken fingers were also good sized and tasty. I ordered light (soup & salad) so I could finish my five year olds tasty chicken fingers and fries. Service was great. Waiter noticed my wife was given regular fries when she ordered Truffle fries. He brought a large replacement order without us ever commenting on it leaving the regular fries as a bonus. Adult bleu cheese burger was good and so was the soup & salad. I have eaten here several times previously and have never had a bad meal or poor service.
