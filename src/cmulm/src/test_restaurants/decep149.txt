In a "foodie" town like Chicago, there is the hottest new restaurant about once a month. The Girl and the Goat deserves every one of the thousands of gushing accolades. It is a stunning combination of adventurous, luxurious taste sensations, combined with a fun atmosphere that makes every dinner seem like a party. I took a large group to dinner there this week and we all enetered as sort of uptight partial strangers and exited as best friends over the course of one of the most memorable meals I've had. The chef recommended a tasting menu of the restaurant "greatest hits" signature dishes ( oh my, the pigface! Oh my, the roasted goat leg !) and combined with the warm, funny attentions of our server Brendan ( who at the end of the evening was also considered to be a best friend), this meal was perfect! It is expensive, but worth every penny. If you are looking for dinner to be an event- don't walk- run to the Girl and the Goat!
