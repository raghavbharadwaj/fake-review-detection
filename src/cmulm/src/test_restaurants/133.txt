Went to Chicago for a business trip and my colleague (a local from Chicago) took me to Gibson's. This is a great steakhouse overall...Service was excellent - staff was very friendly and knowlegeable about steak cuts and wine pairings. Great place for business dinner, take your family as well as for a romantic dinner. Notice that there are a lot of locals that usually hang out at their bar... Most clients were having business dinner.
