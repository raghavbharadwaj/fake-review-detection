We went to Shaw's for the house specials and were well impressed by the quality and generous sweet and juicy portions, served with no unnecessary extras - just lemon and liquid butter. South African Lobster tail was shelled and perfectly cooked, a light and tender texture. The red king crab was the highlight of our trip to date. We've eaten plenty of good tasty crab before but this set a new standard. The legs were half cracked already making it all too easy to extract the clean, fresh and sweet flesh inside. That's all we ate, it surprised us how filling it was. The service from front of house and our waiter was very friendly, professional and refreshingly honest about where we should focus our attention to experience the best Shaw's has to offer. Great beer matching with a Goose Island Sophie. The place was packed and had a real buzz in the atmosphere, decor a grand old style. A true fine dining experience. Highly recommended. $140 plus tip & tax.
