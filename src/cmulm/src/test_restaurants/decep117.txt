Weber Grill Restaurant is my family's favorite "home away from home" when it comes to dining out. With $10 lunches the whole family can enjoy and live music in the evenings on a few nights, Weber Grill is what American dining should be all about. American steakhouses can be tricky places to prune a following for. Either the house must be so fancy that casual diners can be intimidated, or it risks coming off like a standby truckers' buffet with overdone steaks. Weber Grill Restaurant is neither of those. Even though I feel like I can go there for a special occasion, I also feel like I can just pop in for a laidback evening with my spouse or closest friends. I love the downtown Chicago location for Weber because I can make a night of it in Chicago. There is so much more to do before or after dining there. But, I enjoy the suburban location as well: particularly in Schaumburg, Illinois, close to where I live. All restaurants have the same warm decor and impressive dining rooms. There is never a problem gaining a reservation at Weber, even on busy weekends. The staff at Weber are real pros when it comes to serving meals fast without making patrons feel like they must rush. And, patrons are able to have the best cocktails at the bar while they wait. My favorite meal, of course, consists of Weber's famous steaks. They are among the best I have had. The meat is prime and often locally-sourced. But, even people who do not eat red meat or meat at all can find something at Weber. They have a formidable a la carte menu, fresh market rate seafood and a variety of soups and salads to choose from. If you haven't checked out Weber Grill Restaurant during your residency in Illinois or vacation to Chicago, do yourself a great service and add it to your list. I plan to keep Weber a part of my life for a long time.
