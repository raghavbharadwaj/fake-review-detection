I have been to Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse several times, each time being a pleasant visit. They have vallet parking. The service was very good, we were waited on promptly and the food arrived in a timely manner. There was so much to choose from menu. The food was fantastic and the prices were comparable. All in all, I felt very favorable to this restaurant. I would, and have, recommended this place to friends and family.
