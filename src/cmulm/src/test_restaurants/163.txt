The food is great - as the waiters will explain, you order 1-2 items per person & share it all family style. The food comes as it's ready so things are constantly arriving - which actually makes tasting the different items easier to do. The staff is friendly & efficient - very efficient. Six of us were in and out for dinner on a Friday night in a little over an hour - not a place to linger. Things move very fast & the noise level is high. This is NOT a quiet, romantic date kind of place, though it does seem to be a very hip, happening scene with lots of attractive people mixing and mingling.
