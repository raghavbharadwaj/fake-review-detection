Shaw's Crab House in Chicago is the perfect place to visit when you have a hankering for fresh, delicious seafood. Located just a few blocks from Chicago Harbor, Shaw's provides world-class dining in an upscale environment. I wore a jeans skirt and a nice top, and felt totally comfortable there. So it's not so fancy that you feel uncomfortable. Since I live in Chicago, I often show off the city to out-of-town friends over lunch. I usually suggest the hand-rolled maki (the spicy shrimp with salmon and lemon is the best!). For dinner, I like to order up a dozen half-shell oysters. Given the quality and the portion sizes, you'll find that It won't bust your budget. Another of my favorites is the authentic Broiled Lake Michigan Whitefish with the horseradish crust is another treat - and, again, it's reasonably priced. I also recommend checking out the sustainable seafood menu, which provides several selections you'll feed good about eating. I was too full to order dessert the last time I ate there, and I wish now that I had saved room. They have the BEST key lime pie, which I always love after eating sushi. Make sure you call ahead for a reservation. The restaurant is quite popular.
