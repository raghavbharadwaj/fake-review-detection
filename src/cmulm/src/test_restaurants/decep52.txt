The Purple Pig in Chicago is located in a beautiful location downtown near the river and proves to be one of the premier dining locations in the city. Upon arriving at the Purple Pig, we were greeted by the hostess and immediately brought to our table. At first glance, the menu is overwhelming with a large variety of fantastic sounding dishes. For an appetizer we decided on the calamari and it was delicious. The calamari were fried perfectly leading to a crisp and crunchy texture and a nice, juicy flavor. The fregula and radishes that came on the side were a nice touch. I then decided to order wine from the vast and exotic wine list with a selection that is sure to please all wine connoisseurs. It was then time to order dinner which was difficult with all the different menu options. I decided on the meatball slider with Parmesan and arugula and it was to die for. The meatballs were tender and succulent with a great flavor. The marinara was also done well as it was just slightly sweet and of the perfect texture. The rolls on which the sliders came on were fresh baked and toasted to a nice crisp. For desert, it had to be Grandma D's chocolate cake which was, like the rest of the meal, delicious. The cake was moist and full of flavor and was a perfect ending to an excellent meal. Overall I would give The Purple Pig four stars out of four with great service, great food, and a great wine list. It is pricey, but the quality of the food reflects the prices an then some. It is now one of my favorites in the Chicago area.
