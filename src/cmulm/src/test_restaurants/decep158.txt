I just happened upon Girl and the Goat with my family and boy am I so glad that I did. It is a bit pricey but the food is totally worth it! The chickpea fritters are to die for. Its a great place to hang out with family. The service was good. Our waitress Ashley was hilarious. We will definitely be returning.
