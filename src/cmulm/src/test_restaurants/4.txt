We have been to both the original Joes in Miami as well as what has now become one of the best places in Chicago. There is a reason that this is call Joes Seafood PRIME STEAK & Stone Crab The steaks are some of the best in Chicago...which is the superbowl of Steak! We had the bone in filet that was aged perfectly. We also had one of the finest service experiences ever. Friendly, fast , knowledgeable...and gave us a personal guided tour of the menu. I believe his name was Oz...and he was a food wizard! Save room for dessert...the pies may bring tears to your eyes!
