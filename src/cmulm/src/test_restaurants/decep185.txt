Recently i had the extreme pleasure of being able to eat out at The Signature Room at the 95th. While i don't tend to treat myself to often, I had heard great things about this restaurant from a coworker of mine and decided to try it. I can honestly say that it didn't just meet my expectations, it blew them out of the water. The view is one of the first things you notice, a spectacular skyline view of the city, especially gorgeous at night with all of the lights shining. The staff we're all very professional and polite, even giving me some great suggestions on what wine would go well with my dish. The menu was simple, clean, and elegant. The table sets were also rather pretty. While slightly on the pricey side, my Manhattan steak was cooked to a medium perfection, and my dinner experience was one of the best of my entire life. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in some premier dining.
