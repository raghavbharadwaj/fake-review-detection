After waiting 4 months, we finally had a reservation at a decent time, but on a Monday night. It was crowded, and the place is happening. It's a great space and has a fun atmosphere. The food is unique and very tasty. I like that it was a small plate thing so you can taste a lot of items, but wished the small plates had a little bit more food. The server recommended 4-5 plates for 2 people, but I felt like we could have eaten twice that many of plates and probably would have if they wouldn't have been so pricy. I'm sure the prices were determined by the unique ingredients, but I feel like there should be a bit more food. Not quite a place for value, but definitely worth a visit!
