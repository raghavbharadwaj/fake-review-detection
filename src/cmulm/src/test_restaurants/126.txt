We enjoy our annual post Thanksgiving Chicago pilgrimage for shopping, sightseeing and steak dinners. While we have several favorite steak restaurants we will always put Gibson's as a not-to-miss first priority. This year's dining experience was exceptional, starting with an accommodating barman and a hostess who, upon learning of a hearing problem, took time to locate a quieter table for us. The bone-in filet was the best we've experienced, the sides were huge, and we had to forgo their signature desserts this year. Only once in many years, when we arrived before opening, were there any empty tables, so be prepared to enjoy your meal with lots of company. The servers were attentive and enthusiastic. It works best to call ahead for reservations, even if it's only an hour or two before you want to arrive; otherwise seating is hit or miss, We would not rate this as a particularly quiet romantic choice nor an easy place to take a large group for a special occasion.
