We took the family to Mike Ditka's Restaurant on a saturday night. I was a little concerned about the prices, but figured what the heck, when's the next time we'll be in chicago? I'm glad we went. It is right up my alley. It is the perfect blend of classey, dark wood, low light cigar bar and sports bar. Obviously there was a lot of Mike Ditka and Chicago Bear memorabilia. We sat in the booths across from the bar and had views of the games on the TVs. Our waitress was everything you want in a waitress...courtious, helpful, patient, and not hard to look at. As far as food, let me start with the kid menu. Everything on it is around $6. My son got the 2 mini cheeseburgers and my daughter got the chicken strips. Both came with a generous portion of fries. My son gave his the ultimate compliment: the burgers were so good he didn't need ketchup. The chicken strips were hand breaded and great. I had the rib platter, it looked like something out of the Flintstones: a giant rack of bbq rids and a mountain of fries. The ribs were tender enough that you could pull the meat off with a fork. But if you did want to eat with your hands, they brought out 2 hot towels with lemon to clean up. The wife had the Medallions 3 ways. She raved about them, siad it was nice to get a steak cooked right the first time (rare). The steaks get a little pricey and they don't come with any sides, which makes them more expensive to eat if you want to go that way. They also had a pretty good selection of draft and bottle beers. We really didn't look over the wine list, but I expect it was above average. We didn't get to see the upstairs, maybe next time. Although I really enjoyed the bar area where we were seated. Wife and son were hoping to meet Mike Ditka, but it was the night before the Super Bowl and I told them in advance that there is a .1% chance of him being there. One last thing, the location is about a block off of Michigan Ave, not far from the Water Tower.
