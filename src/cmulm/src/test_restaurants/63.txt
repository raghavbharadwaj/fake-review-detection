Recommended by local Chicago friends and did not disappoint! AMAZING seafood, but even more impressive is the knowledge of the staff about seafood. We had the blue crab legs, oysters on the half shell, swordfish, salmon. We have two sons ages 9 and 12 and they ordered off the adult menu. Kids menu and mostly fried foods and regular kid menu items. I would have liked to see a small salmon or fish item on the kids menu. Regardless, we all had great seafood here! We were going to go to Joe's Crabshack the next night and our local Chicago contact told us after going to Shaw's we would be disappointed in Joe's! LOVED the seafood options and staff knowledge!
