We had a lovely experience at Quartino last night. I was dining with two small children (one very picky), my husband, and my mother-in-law. I stumbled upon this restaurant because it is so close to the condo where we are staying. We quickly were seated, and the server described the tapas style menu to us. My 4 year old was acting a little crabby because he just awoke from a nap..We had promised him chocolate milk. Well, they didn't have any. They had an employee go to 7-11 and buy some for him!!!! We never would have asked them to do that, they just did it!!! Such nice service!! The food was fantastic. Just enough to share for each person. We started with the cheese stuffed dates, wrapped in prosciutto. Delicious. Then on to pizza margherita with a lovely crispy crust. The veal skirt steak was fantastic, as was the shrimp risotto. We shared a great bottle of Malbec, that was reasonably priced. Later, I'm not sure if it was the front of house manager, or not- but a manager type came over and chatted with us about our visit to Chicago. He was so super nice!! His name is Nicholas Haubrich. If you get a chance to go, chat with him- he was great. I never review restaurants!! This is the first time, and I'm a foodie. That should tell you how great this place is!! Enjoy!
