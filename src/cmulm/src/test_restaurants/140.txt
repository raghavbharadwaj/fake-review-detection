This was a must see on a recent trip to Chicago. Locals galore, great outside dining and people watching. Homemade smoked salmon to die for! Friendly and helpful staff, historic photos on the wall, a very busy but efficient place! Reasonable prices for lunch, very happening place at dinner. Ate there twice!
