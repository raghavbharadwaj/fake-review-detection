What really stood out was the service. The restaurant and bar were full and we had to stand in the aisle a bit - but even there the service was attentive with a drink menu brought to us immediately and an effort made to seat us as soon as a place opened up at the bar. From our entry to the very end, every single employee there added positively to our experience. We also had the good fortune to be seated at the rear of the bar right next to the food prep area. It was quite a show and the preparers were more than willing to answer a myriad of questions about everything they were creating. Though sitting at the communal tables or the other end of the bar would have been convivial as well, this spot made our night. A fun restaurant with a swine theme. "Cheese, Swine, and Wine" Lots of creative tasty choices served tapas style so you can try a bunch for a reasonable price. Every dish we had was perfect: Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (ears were fried like onion rings and the kale literally melted in your mouth), Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana (one word, yum); Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese Schmear (a meal in itself); and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (also melted in your mouth). Nothing here was ordinary and there were lots of opportunities to try things outside of your comfort zone. At the same time nothing was so outlandish as to be offensive. Each dish was a perfectly tasty combination. Overall would say this place is a must and is in my top ten favorite restaurant experiences.
