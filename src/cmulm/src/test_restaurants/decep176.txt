I visited this restaurant during a recent visited to Chicago. I was very happy with my margherita pizza, it had just the right amount of cheese and sauce and was nicely presented. My friend very much enjoyed her order of tortellini. The server was friendly and made us feel very welcome. We would definitely visit here again.
