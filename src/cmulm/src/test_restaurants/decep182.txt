My husband and I decided to try Quartino for dinner one night recently while his parents and sister were visiting, and it was wonderful. The dining room was very open and had a lively atmosphere. The decor was vintage and cute, and the retuarant smells like heaven as soon as you walk in the door. The food was amazing, the tortellini was some of the best I've ever had, my husband kept trying to steal it off my plate! The menu even had some vegetarian options listed, which made my sister-in-law very happy. The staff was friendly and quick. It was a great night and my husband and I will definitely be coming back soon!
