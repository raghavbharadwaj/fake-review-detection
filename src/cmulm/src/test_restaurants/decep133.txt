I visited Gibsons for the first time today. I am from out of town and it is very rare to find restaurant quality like this. The food was amazing and extremely cost effective. I basically got 2 meals out of the one I paid for. My service was exceptional and the environment was clean and mostly quiet. Overall, this was a great experience.
