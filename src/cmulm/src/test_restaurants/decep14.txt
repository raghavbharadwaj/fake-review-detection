If you're ever in the Chicago area, you MUST make a reservation (or several) to experience Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. Imagine that your taste buds are starving and Joe's is the Oasis to quench their thirst. Our party of 6 was swiftly seated once we all arrived. My friends had to drag me along with them since I wanted to stop and look at all the plaques and interesting decor along the way. It is always promising to be intrigued by the decor and feel at home by the staff. Our handsome waiter gave me the impression that he had been highly trained and was serious about making our time there the most memorable. The menu was quite extensive and the waiter was very patient with us going over the daily specials and helping us make our selections. While I was appalled that one of our party actually ordered a classic hamburger for $15.00, it arrived perfectly cooked to order and looked like it was prepared to be photographed on the cover of Bon Appetit Magazine. All of his menu selections seemed to be as close to his daily lifestyle and simple tastes, but the recipes for these culinary masterpieces seemed to surprise me at every turn, including the macaroni and cheese, as a side dish. He devoured it with enthusiasm and teased the rest of us that we were missing out on the best burger he's ever had. Each and everyone of us specifically chose a different portion of the menu to order from. We wanted the full experience and while most things were expensive for our budget, it was well worth the extra cost. We will be returning each and every opportunity that we are able. It was an eating experience we want to indulge in more.
