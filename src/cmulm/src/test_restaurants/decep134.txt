Gibsons is the kind of place you go for a really nice evening. You can tell they keep standards -- clean environment, professional severs, and nice presentation of the menu. They even keep standards of their guests: no men in sleeveless shirts. You might find it a turn-off, but I like that guests are encouraged to promote the overall swanky feel of the restaurant. When you're there, you're not just at some neighborhood grill or dive restaurant, you're having an elevated experience. And that's all not even to mention the food, which is amazing. I am a steak lover and I had the porterhouse, which was generously portioned and cooked absolutely perfectly. The texture was almost buttery it was so tender; I can honestly say I've never had a better cooked steak. But the perfection of the menu doesn't stop at the beef, something you might expect at a steakhouse. Not at Gibsons. My boyfriend doesn't eat red meat (too bad for him at such a restaurant!) and he had the roasted chicken, which was seriously just as buttery and amazing as my steak was. I found myself picking off his plate any scraps I could find when he wasn't looking. In short, the restaurant is everything you want from a nice night out. The service is prompt and attentive as well; we left a generous tip. We will definitely be back in the near future, it may be my new favorite spot for date night.
