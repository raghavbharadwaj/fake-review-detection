Here is a place that is a combination of a bar and a nice elegant two story restaurant. The menu has a wide array of items to choose from, as well as, the price ranges. In other words, all budgets can fit in here. It is walking distance from parking and to the Hard Rock Cafe. Oh yeah, Chicago women are attractive. Great place to take a date or with friends or family - at least that is what I got to observe.
