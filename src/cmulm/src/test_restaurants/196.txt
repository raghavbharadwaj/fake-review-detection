Going up to the 95th floor and enjoying the views of Chicago was a real treat. The views are amazing, the service is good and the food was delicious. We asked our hotel to make a reservation for us, which I would strongly recommend as the restaurant was very busy on a Friday night. Having a reservation at the restaurant also meant that we didn't have to queue for the elevator in the building and could go straight up. Otherwise the queue for the elevator for people who only wanted to go to the bar looked like it would be at least half-an-hour wait. We had steak and fish, and both were delicious, also tried their cheesecake for dessert and that was good too. Our waiters were very pleasant and were always at hand when needed. There was a pianist and the atmosphere was great. We asked about the dress-code before we went and were told "business-casual" so wore the best clothes we had with us (as we were travelling). We were glad we asked about this beforehand as most people were dressed very smart. We were slightly surprised when we had to pay for the cloakroom when we picked up our coats - I would have expected this to be free-of-charge - and on top of that the girl in the cloakroom also asked us for a tip as she handed us our coats! Overall though we had a great evening and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
