Based on the reviews, we decided to try this place. We were not disappointed. All the dishes we had were excellent. Some I may not do again (bone marrow was intriguing but not something I need to do again!) but I am glad I tried it because it was good. Other dishes I loved-the beets with goat cheese and the scallops! Our waiter was awesome. He knew when to offer advise, when to show up and when to go away. The place was busy as rush hour, but he acted like we were his only customer. We sat at a communal table. This was a lot of fun. We met some great people doing so! It is a loud place though, so conversation is difficult!
