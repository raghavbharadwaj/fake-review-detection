The Weber Grill is a fantastic Restaurant. Anytime you want mouth watering steak, this is the place to go. The NY Strip Steaks are delectable. Although it's a little pricey, it's definitely worth it. The atmosphere is sub par to none and all the waiters are super hospitable. I felt like they were my personal waiters. This is definitely the place to take a date on a romantic night out.
