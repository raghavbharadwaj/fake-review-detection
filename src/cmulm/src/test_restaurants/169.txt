My husband and I ate here and it was our favorite place we ate at the whole trip (and we ate at places where the bill was much higher than this place). If you like trying a bunch of different meals or trying to keep your meal costs down in Chicago, this is the place to stop at. They give you smaller portions of things but the price is lower than a full entree. But the portion sizes are not that small (2 people can get a good amount out of 2-3 plates) that you would leave starved. We started off with a antipasto plate (you get to pick what you want on it.. build it yourself) and moved onto 2 entress and a pizza. Then we had dessert which was very good (doughnuts were fabulous). You can order the food as you go and they bring them out when they are ready so you can stop when you are full and try to keep 1 order in as you get near finishing the previous order. The wine is good and not very expensive.
