I was recently in Chicago for a convention. A friend recommended that I visit The Signature Room At The 95th.It is probably one of the best recommendations a person has ever given me. The Signature Room At The 95th is an amazing restaurant it overlooks the city of Chicago. I ordered the Spiced Duck Breast for dinner the dish was mouthwatering and had an authentic taste. I also ordered a glass of wine to go with the dish. The food and the view of Chicago added to the moment, it was spectacular. The overall feel and environment of the restaurant is luxurious, the waiters and waitresses are friendly and both knowledgeable. I recommend The Signature Room At The 95th to anyone seeking the best of Chicago.
