Rather spur of the moment, my friend and I decided to stop at Quartino for dinner. We were told there was about a 30+ minute wait but it ended up being much quicker than that. I can't vouch for inside since we were seated at the end of the outdoor patio, which I was thrilled about. My meal was perfect for the warm spring evening. I started with the assortment of 3 kinds of marinated olives and a glass of Prosecco. Then, I moved onto their Margherita pizza and it was delicious! It came out super fast (after being told pizzas take 10-15 minutes to arrive, it was out in 2. No lie.) and was piping hot and oh so tasty. Highly recommend it! However, my friend was not so lucky. Somehow, her pizza ended up taking about an hour to arrive. :( I think it was a miscommunication - we'd heard food runners ask neighboring tables if they'd ordered a pizza and they hadn't. Our waiter was fairly attentive but he was busy - though he could have been better about making sure that pizza was out asap after he noticed she hadn't eaten 30 minutes later. Nevertheless, the pizza was taken off the bill and he apologized many times so its all good - this wouldn't deter me from eating there again next time I was in Chicago...mistakes happen sometimes, right? Quartino also had a great wine and specialty cocktails list, a gluten-free menu, and some *amazing* looking desserts. The prices were very reasonable too (pizzas were $10-$12)...I was expecting it to be pricier. If you're in the mood for some good Italian food, this is a wonderful choice.
