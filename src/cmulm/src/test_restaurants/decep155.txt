I love the Girl & the Goat. I take my wife there at least twice every month and the food and drink is nothing but outstanding. We usually get the Belgian Ale, but we also love the wine and cocktails. The food menu offers a wide range of options, ranging from fried pickles to beef tongue. While we mostly stick to the drinks, we also love their fried oysters. Overall, I love the Girl & the Goat and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time with good food and drink.
