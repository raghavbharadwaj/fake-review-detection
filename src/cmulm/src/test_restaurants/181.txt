Although it was raining, the view from this delightful restaurant on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Center (enter on Chestnut just east of Michigan in the Magnificent Mile) is spectacular, and eating here saves the $11 entry fee for the Observatory! The Sunday brunch ($42, alcoholic drinks extra) is in the same top class! What a spread: from made-to-order omelets, breakfast meats of every description, eggs Benedict, potatoes, grits, (but no scrambled eggs in a steamer!), fruit, cheese, seafood - fish and shellfish in abundance - pate, sauces and toppings beyond counting, hot dishes to make any mouth water, pastries and wonderful rolls galore, to a carving station offering ham and medium rare prime rib! Then there were the deserts, which we never got to; we filled up on the good stuff! The buffet, on both sides of a narrower part of the south side of the building (there may have been another on the north side; we never got there) ran for at least 100 feet. And service was superb, just wonderful; no wait to have your coffee refilled, a used plate removed or silver replaced. The buffet was in constant replenishment, and everything was cordial and oh so correct. Marvelous, just MARVELOUS!
