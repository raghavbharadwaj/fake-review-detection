Last night was my boyfriend and I's second anniversary, and I knew he would do something special for it. He brought me to The Signature Room at the 95th, which I've always wanted to check out, but have never felt I had the time! We were greeted in a prompt and genuinely friendly manner upon approaching, and ushered to a window seat with an incredible view in the blink of an eye. We had arrived just in time for brunch, which is my favorite meal of the day. After inspecting our options, I settled on the Brie and Pear Quiche, while my boyfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict. We ordered coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice to enjoy while we waited, and they came quickly. The juice did indeed taste fresh, and the coffee was hot and one of the best cups I've had in a long time. Our breakfast arrived in a reasonable time frame, and everything was better than expected. The staff were friendly and efficient, making sure we had everything we needed without overly hovering. My favorite part was discovering they have a focus on sustainability, buy their meats locally, and give back to the community through philanthropic endeavors. I'd give this restaurant 5 out of 5 stars, hands down, and plan to return frequently in the future.
