We were told that the wait was 90 minutes. After 20, I went in and inquired, and we (2) were seated in the (noisy, busy) bar 10 minutes later. Despite the hubbub, the waiter was attentive, the appetizer great, and the entrees terrific. By the time we finished dinner, the bar scene had calmed down a bit, and we lingered over a Hot Chocolate with Mezcal. This place is justly famous - the menu is mouthwatering just to read, and we left very happy.
