I ordered the ravioli and the salmon, and I have to say, it was one of the best dinners I have had this year. The salmon was perfect, and the pork inside the raviolis was something I've never had before, but will be getting again. Prices may be a tiny bit high for some people, but it is well worth it for the quality of food they serve. I would recommend Quartino to anyone, and have recommended already to my family members. Very, very good restaurant.
