Had a business dinner there. The steak and sides were great but I thought that the price was a bit more than the quality. Was supposed to be Prime Rib Eye but not sure thats what I got. The noise was another concern, could not hear yourself much less the people you were there with. We wanted to talk business and it was not possible.
