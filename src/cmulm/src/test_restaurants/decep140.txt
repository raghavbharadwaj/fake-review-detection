Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse. What can I say about them? Well, I guess I can start out by saying this is my new favorite restaurant. The food? Amazing. The staff? Very friendly and super helpful. The prices? Very reasonable. What more can you ask for from a restaurant? I asked for a New York Strip Steak, cooked medium rare, and guess what I got. Exactly that. Cooked perfectly, wonderfully sized portion, and tasted so good. I can't wait to go back, but I am not sure what I want to try next. Maybe a burger? Probably not. The steak was too good to ever pass up. I walked in and was immediately friendly and helpful. I got a table almost immediately. My waitress, Alice, started out by asking if I wanted to order some appetizers or drinks. She was very friendly and helpful without being overly-annoying or invasive. Needless to say, she got a nice tip. The food, though priced slightly high, was very reasonable when you consider the portion size, flavor, and speedy service. Overall this is an amazing place, and I 100% recommend you check it out. 4.5/5
