Wow! Mike Ditka's in Chicago is one of my favorite restaurants, it's seriously amazing. They have the best steak I've ever had, cooked to perfection and seasoned amazingly. I go to this place all the time, and every experience is incredible. The waiters and staff are all very nice, and are there to make sure that you have a great time. Their variety of meats are amazing, and almost every entree is on point. I personally love their steaks, but everything on the menu is good. I got to say, this place is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone.
