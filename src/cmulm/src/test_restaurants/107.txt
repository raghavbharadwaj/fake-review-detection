Food - I was expecting just the standard fare which was there but they also had some exciting variations to remind you you're in a big city. I had the crab cake appitizer which is served on top of a corn and black bean salsa, with chipotle mayo. I followed that with a "Martini" burger which is topped with blue cheese vodka sauce and green olive. It came under cooked for medium. Dessert was an apple crisp grilled in a brown paper bag. Presentation wasnt appetizing but it was Delicious! Value-about $55 before tip for a glass of wine, a draft beer, 2 appitizers, 1 shared burger and 1 shared dessert. Service-Nothing bad, nothing spectacular. Atmosphere-The kitchen is open to the restaurant. The flames jumping up from oversized weber grills makes for and exciting walk to the table.
