My husband and I ate at Quartino's this past weekend. Although we were dissapointed that there were no available tables outide on the patio; I absolutely loved the historical decor on the inside of the resaurant. We shared the Soprano pizze, it was amazing! We can't wait to take my husband's parents there when they are in town next month. If the weather allows hopefully we will get to enjoy a patio table.
