You know, you can roll out a lot of superlatives about Chicago. It's New York City without the pretentiousness. OK, maybe it's missing a couple other things, too, but it's a great city. So, too, are some of its great restaurants and Gibson's is just that. The food is excellent, the crowd is boisterous, they don't short you on the drinks, and the service is normally outstanding. It's also located in the heart of the nightlife area inhabited by tourists and those who make Chicago tick. In other words, if you're looking for a place to hang out with the artsy crowd, well, this ain't it. I love this Gibson's.
