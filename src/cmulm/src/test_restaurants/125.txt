For Southerners, this was an exciting visit to a quintessential Chicago icon. We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our dinner. The restaurant is crowded and noisy, but your fellow guests are interesting and entertaining. We were told it is a place to see and be seen. The steaks are excellent (not the best ever but still top shelf). Service was very good. Side items are sized to share. The desert is too big for 2 - our table of 8 shared one big desert! For steak lovers, the ribeye has another name and is served bone-in. From the steaks presented, there seemed little difference in what they call T-Bone vs Porterhouse. It appears they designate Porterhouse by the size of the filet muscle (vs. presence or absence of longisimus costarum muscle) We all had filet minion which typically I take medium. Half was medium, with half medium-rare. The flavor was excellent and I always eat my steaks without sauce, etc. The meat should speak for itself and it did. Gibson's has it's own USDA designation for Prime which is a bit less marbled than a traditional prime. It is more like Choice marbling. The steaks had excellent flavor, body, and texture. Something you would expect in a good steakhouse. We ordered twice baked potato (excellent), creamed spinach (very good) and asparagus (too mature) for sides. Overall the whole experience was fun. If I was going to a steakhouse for a wonderful steak, I might try another restaurant next time - nothing against Gibson's but it wasn't the best steak I've ever had - probably top 10 though. But it was excellent and the whole evening was made better by our start at Gibson's!
