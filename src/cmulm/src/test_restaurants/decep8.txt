I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. Although I have been eating snow and king crab my whole life, I had never tried stone crab before and was eager to. I started with the spinach stuffed mushrooms, and they were perfectly cooked- moist and well seasoned. I tried some of my husband's cole slaw, and will definitely order that on my next visit as well. The stone crabs were amazing! Since I hadn't tried them before, I decided to go for the medium size stone crabs. The light seasonings went very well with the delicious natural flavor of these unique crabs. My husband had the new york strip steak which was cooked to his order (rare! Not my style.) He said it was juicy and very full of flavor. We enjoyed an excellent dinner, and I cannot wait to find another reason to "celebrate" and head back here.
