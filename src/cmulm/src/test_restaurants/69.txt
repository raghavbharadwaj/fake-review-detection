One might think that Shaw's is a tourist trap, but it really isn't! The food was fresh and delicious and the service was excellent. They have a few different options for seating, depending on your preferences. You can choose a diner style setting, a white table cloth setting or fine-dining like setting but in the bar area. We found the diner section a little loud and the dining room was empty, so we sat just outside the main dining room near the bar. It was the prefect compromise! We had both the hot and cold appetizer platters and both were delicious. A nice mix of seafoods and very well prepared. For our main we split the haddock special of the day (it was a Tuesday) and it was also delicious. We had a free tuna maki (thanks to the Yelp app) and it was also very tasty! They gave us a free piece of chocolate cake since we were first time visitors, what a nice touch! It was one of the best pieces of chocolate cake I've had a in a while, very most and creamy. Our server was very attentive and really aimed to please. I would definitely go back.
