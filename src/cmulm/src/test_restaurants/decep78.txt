Shaw's Crab House is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. If you have family in town make sure and impress them by taking them to Shaw's. If you like Seafood Shaw's has it all, fresh oysters, crabs, and Sushi. Shaw's also has the best brunch in town. I love going during Sunday Brunch. The brunch is all buffet style and includes, eggs benedict, omelets, and fresh seafood. Come back for dinner and enjoy some of the best tuna in town. If you haven't tried Shaw's than you are missing out.
