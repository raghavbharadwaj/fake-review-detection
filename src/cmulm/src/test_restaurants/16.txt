Great lunch with my bride at Joe's today for lunch. $66 (w/o tip) for stone crab lunch w dessert and filet with dessert. Potatoes and cole slaw was included. The coleslaw is by far hands down the best I've had and my wife loved the crab!! Waitress very knowledgeable about the menu and Chicago. Will come back for sure!
