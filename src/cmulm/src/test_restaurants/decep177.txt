My husband and I are regular customers at Quartino. We just love the atmosphere and friendly staff. It's a fine dining atmosphere with a family restaurant price. My husband tries something different every time we go (about twice a month) and so far has liked everything, but I'm stuck on the pizza Quattro Formaggi. Two thumbs up!
