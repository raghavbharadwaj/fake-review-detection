On Saturday night, September 22, 40 (old) members and spouses of BB chapter, Delta Tau Delta, DePauw University, gathered in a private dining room to celebrate over 50 years of wonderful memories. Classes of 1951-64 were represented and while our tab was in excess of 12 grand, all agreed it was still the best value in town! Since "What happens at Gibsons stays at Gibsons" applies, I'll let you draw your own conclusions. But I will say don't ever hesitate to call them for your next function, be it for 20 or 200. When you walk in the front door you'll be in the hands of hospitality experts, even if half of your guests are on walkers, deaf, in diapers or boarder line Alzheimer's :)
