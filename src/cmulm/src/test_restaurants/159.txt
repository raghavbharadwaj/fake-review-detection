My November reservation was placed in August. Yes, that far in advance. Do not plan to just show up and hope to get in. With that said, so worth the wait. The menu is split in three categories, V F M. The waitress will suggest sharing 2 to 3 plates per person. We ordered 6 which ended up being too much and asked to cancel the final item. The plates are brought out one at a time and spaced out by the kitchen. Our favorites: Shrimp, ham fries, broccoli The menu does change often, so don't get attached to one item. Bottomline, the food combinations we amazing. The sharing portions were larger than expected. The place is very loud, so not for an intimate date. We were so close to the table next door that we learned all about their children and travels. Overall, an amazing dining experience.
