I arrived late in Chicago last Wednesday night, and the woman at the hotel front desk recommended Weber Grill as a good place that serves later into the evening (It was after 10 pm). I walked up the street and was seated immediately. I didn't feel at all awkward as a woman alone, in spite of the bustling atmosphere. My server, Jamar, was warm, friendly and really knew the menu AND the cooks that night. He directed me away from things that weren't so good that evening and toward something that would leave me with a lasting impression. I started with a "Joe's Martini" ($9), prepared from a custom-made vodka. It was good and STRONG. For my entree, I had the bone-in rib-eye, rare. You can add things to your entree for either $3 or 2 for $5. I chose smoked mushrooms and the bleu cheese-herb mix. I also "upgraded" from either baked or mashed to the whipped sweet potatoes with maple butter. They were delicious. My steak was cooked to perfection. It seems difficult to find a cook these days who can properly distinguish meat temperature (thermometers, anyone?), but this cook was skilled. It was quite expensive ($38.50 by the time I "upgraded" everything), but how refreshing to pay that for a meal that pleased me in the extreme. I am a cook and can be a fussy pain in the neck, and I really liked my meal. They also have a nice wine vault with windows so you can eye the selections. I took "home" a half bottle of a favorite wine that I have trouble finding here in California, where it's produced (Mt. Veeder cab, 2002). I also took home an apple/caramel dessert, which took me three nights to finish, it was so big. It was also quite tasty. Perhaps it depends on the servers and cooks each night, but I had a great time and delicious meal at this place, and would go again.
