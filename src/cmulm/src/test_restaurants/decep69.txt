Shaw's Crab House- Chicago is anything but "Crabby". The whole staff from the hostess to the chef were extremely friendly and made my dining experience one to be remembered. There whole menu looked extremely appetizing, but I finally decided to start with the lobster cocktail. It was amazing, the cilantro chile sauce really gave it a nice, refreshing kick. I then opted for the parmesan crusted chicken. Again, it was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the breading was crunchy on the outside and the chicken was juicy on the inside. As far as the sauteed spinach..well let's just say I couldn't get enough of it! I don't know how I did it, but I ordered dessert as well. Shaw's Raspberry Pie! The raspberries tasted like they were fresh out of the garden. This restaurant will definitely get my business again!
