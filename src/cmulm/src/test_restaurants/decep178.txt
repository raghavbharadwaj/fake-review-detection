I love this place! It has that authentic, rustic Italian feel, in everything from the decor to the menu. The Veal Osso Bucco is probably my favorite dish here, and it's the best I've had anywhere. The lunch special is a great deal, too. Quartino is also a wonderful place to stop in and have some wine on the patio. Don't miss out on this one.
