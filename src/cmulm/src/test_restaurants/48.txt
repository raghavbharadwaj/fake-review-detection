I had read about the Purple Pig, but when I went there last week, the food far, far exceeded my expectations. The quality of the ingredients, combined with truly unusual combinations, created one of my best meals in the last few years (and I travel and eat at a large number of restaurants each year). I loved it so much that I went back two nights later to try some other items and found them to be equally outstanding.
