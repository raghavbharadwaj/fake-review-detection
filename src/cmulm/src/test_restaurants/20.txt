We came here for my wife's birthday on a Sunday. It was Father's Day, so it was impossible to get a dinner reservation. We opted to sit in the lounge, and very tactfully "stalked" a couple we observed preparing to leave and took their table. (Someone did the same thing to us on our way out, so this is a strategy that we will use again if unable to get a reservation.) The key lime pie is outstanding, and their bloody marys are the best I've had in Chicago so far. I actually would go back there for brunch just to have their bloody marys. The crab cakes were very good but I've honestly had better. The stuffed mushrooms were excellent. We shared the crab claws and enjoyed them, but I didn't taste anything any different than what I would have expected. I might be biased since I grew up in Maryland and ate good crabs several times a year, but I'm just being honest. Overall, it was a nice experience and I would come back. The location is stellar (near Nordstrom and the Conrad), so I could easily see incorporating lunch/dinner here into a great downtown outing with lots of cool stuff to do close by.
