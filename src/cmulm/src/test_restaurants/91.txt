Excellent meal. Very busy on a Wednesday night, we had to sit outside, where it was mega hot, but worth it. Mojitos were fresh, guacamole was perfection, and the meats that were served with the tacos we ordered were divine. Various types of tamales were enjoyed thoroughly-- sweet corn, shrimp, and more. Very happy.
