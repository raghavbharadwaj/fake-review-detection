Wow. I had an incredible night at the Signature Room. Me and my boyfriend showed up 30 minutes late for out reservation, but the hostess was so nice! She gave us a table and didn't even mention our faux-pas. I got the halibut that was like heaven on a plate and my bf got the snapper. It was our three year anniversary and when our server Brian found out, he brought us two complimentary flutes of champagne and a free dessert. I mean, what? Best service ever. This place is incredibly expensive, but it's perfect for a special event.
