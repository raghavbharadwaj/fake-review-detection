You have to make reservations well in advance but it is worth it. The staff was attentive and informative as I needed some explanations of some of the menu items. The Pig Face for example..don't let that scare you off, it was basically an extremely flavorful pulled pork. I had the Kohlrabi salad comprised of fennel, Evalon goat cheese, toasted almonds, and blueberries with a ginger dressing. The menu changes frequently as they like to get fresh local ingredients. The atmosphere is casual with a slightly trendy neighborhood vibe. Everything we ate was fantastic, the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was great.
