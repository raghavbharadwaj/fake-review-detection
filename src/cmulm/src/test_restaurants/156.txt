It must be my age.......but I enjoy having a plate of food placed in front of me. I don't have to worry about about taking more than my share and shuffling food around the table. Not to say that the food wasn't delish and interesting. I especially enjoyed the pork belly and pork shank. It was worth the drive and putting on a nice frock was fun. The restaurant reminded me of a ski lodge. However, tables are close and the noise level is high on Sat. evening. Would I go again.......maybe.
