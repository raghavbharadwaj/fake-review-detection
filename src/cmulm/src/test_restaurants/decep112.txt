My wife and I went to the Weber Grill Restaurant a few weeks ago. The waitstaff was excellent, but expect a wait, even at the bar. I had the Grilled Colorado Lamb Chops and she had the Prime NY Strip. The food was absolutely amazing and I can easily say that these are the best lamb chops I've ever had.
