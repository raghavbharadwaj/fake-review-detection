Had a great experience while there a few weeks ago, ate here 3 times in 4 days (convenience mostly, but no complaints) while staying at the Hilton Garden next door. Great service, get here early on weekends, can be busy. Had a 3 item combo plate with BBQ Meatloaf.........INSANELY GOOD. have never had anything like it, loved every bit of it, was actually on the web trying to get the recipe before we finished dining. Great food, weber coal grills cooking like crazy, my kinda grill. I do have to compliment the person who chooses the bottled beers, You have choosen one that I have, and will always view as one of the BEST Sweet Stouts or beer period, I have ever tasted. I am in no way a beer connoisseur, maybe drink 12 beers a year, I had 4 of these alone, I may become one now, now that I have tried Left Handed Brewery's Milk Sout.....EXCELLENT. Great Restaurant and atmosphere.
