What a great place for surf and turf! My husband and I went to Joe's for our anniversary dinner last week. The atmosphere was fantastic, and the food presentation was gorgeous. The wine list is extensive and truly a delight for any connoisseur. The staff is friendly and professional. Truly sensational, a must have in the Chicago area. Oh, and the New York Strip is to die for!
