Our dinner started with a warm set of olives. The tart and sweetness of the combined olives was superb. Next came the squash blossom rangoon. In which the almonds gave a good crunch. Our entre was a pan roasted halibut. The food was surprisingly wonderful and paired with the rustic feel of the resturaunt made for a wonderful experience. One I would like to repeat over and over.
