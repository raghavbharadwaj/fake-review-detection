I had the luxury of dining with friends at Mike Ditka's in Chicago. Wow! What a place! You will surely want to make reservations just to make sure you're not left out. We did and there was no standing around when we got there. When you first walk in, the decor is truly amazing. We had a nicely set table in one area of the dining room. There are many different areas including some private rooms as well. Our waiter was superb! I really think he would have even cut our steaks for us. For starters, I had the Maryland crab cake. I am a crab cake-aholic, so I'm always looking for the best ones and I think I've found it. It was perfectly broiled with the best crab meat - no shells or cartilege in this one! Next, not being too adventurous, I ordered the chicken noodle soup. I told you I wasn't adventurous. How can you possibly make chicken soup any better? This is just like your grandma makes. Big chunks of real chicken, carrots, and celery were in this soup. For the entree, I love a good steak, so I ordered the Filet Mignon Two ways. One is done up Oscar-style with asparagus and bernaise sauce and the other was encrusted with horseradish around the edges. Ordering it medium was absolutely the way to go. The Oscar-style was phenomenal! The horseradish encrusted can stand on its own. A friend and I shared the fresh broccoli, which was perfectly cooked, not too crunchy and not too mushy. What an awesome meal we had. This was certainly worth the price, although in Chicago, this is a real bargain. I would highly recommend that you make Mike Ditka's your next night out!
