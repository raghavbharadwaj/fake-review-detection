The Weber Grill Restaurant is one of our families favorite weekend outings. They cook everything from delicious Sea Bass (my wife's favorite) to 18 oz. N.Y. Strip steaks (my favorite), all prepared on a traditional Weber grill. They also have a kids menu that my children love. The staff is amazing and have great insight on the menu. They also offer an impressive wine menu with variety like no other. And if you are on one of those no gluten diets they have an "out of this world" menu to cater to you with burgers, salads, ribs, seafood, and much more. They also have a fully stocked bar that has a warm and friendly atmosphere. All in all this restaurant impresses on many levels. Iv recommended them to family, friends, and clients. Keep up the good work Weber Grill Restaurant.
