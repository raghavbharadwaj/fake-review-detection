We had lunch here on Halloween. We had reservations several nights before for dinner, but had to cancel because our flight was delayed. I am so glad we made the effort to get there for lunch. The food was amazing! Everyone had the stone crab bisque, which was very good. For entrees, I had the seafood chopped salad, which was huge and flavorful. My husband and one of our friends had the ahi tuna sandwich with wasabi mayo and homemade sweet potato chips and they both raved about it. My SIL had the stone crap salad, and she loved it. BIL had the fish & chips and he said it was very good. The best part of the meal was the desserts. Our waiter offered half slices of pie, which three of us took him up on. They were huge! I had the key lime, and it was by far the best key lime pie I have ever eaten. The service was great too. Very attentive without being fussy. Our waiter had a great sense of humor. Oh, and the bloody Marys were excellent too...
