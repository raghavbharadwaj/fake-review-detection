This restaurant was absolutely wonderful! I came here with my wife a few days ago and the atmosphere was so calm and warming. Weber Grill was a wonderful place for our anniversary dinner, and we will definitely be going back again soon. The service was great, the menu diverse and very professional looking, and the overall visit exceeded our expectations. Definitely one of my new favorites! Oh, and our food was delicious and cooked perfectly to our expectation!
