If you can handle some noise and a "no reservations" policy, this place offers a unique culinary adventure. The menu is full of unusual offerings, and everything we tried was delicious. The foie gras preparation was light and delicious -- the best I have ever had. Fried pigs ear was served on a bed of crispy kale. The pig's ear was OK -- but the kale was GREAT! Tapas-style portions allow you to try lots of fun new preparations. We spent about $150 for 2 people -- with plenty of excellent wine.
