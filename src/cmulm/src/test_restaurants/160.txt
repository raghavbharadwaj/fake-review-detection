I'm looking at the reviews on this page, and it leads me to wonder what everyone who gave a negative review ate, coz everything we ordered was outstanding. We did not make reservations (a group of four), so they said it was a 2 hour wait. We requested a table, went back to our hotel, freshened up, and then returned, almost close to midnight for the best dining experience - comparable to Mario Batali's Babo in NY (some dishes even outdid that restaurant). We ordered the pig face (of course), lived up to all the hype, so much so that we ordered seconds lol. The tempura fried softshell crab on an eggsalad (makes no sense, I know), but was ridiculously good. Escargot ravioli: delicious. The goat empanadas - didn't even taste like any goat I've had ever before, was scrumptious. The only dish that didn't really like was the chicken. Even the goat cheese cake for desert was amazing. As for ambiance, it was rustic, lively and hip. Our waiter was super helpful - treated us like old friends. The prices were reasonable. Overall, an amazing culinary experience, the only disappointment was having missed Antony Bourdain who went to the restaurant the very next day to shoot the layover!
