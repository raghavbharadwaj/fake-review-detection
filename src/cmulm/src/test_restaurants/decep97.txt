We were absolutely blown away with our experience here last night. Upon arrival, we immediately knew that this was no ordinary Mexican place. The decor and staff was a step above anywhere else we have ever been. Our waiter was very kind and courteous. He helped us navigate the menu and gave us some great suggestions. We were a bit taken aback by the prices at first, but as soon as we tried our food, we knew exactly why. It was incredible! There wasn't a single item that we did not absolutely love. It's nice to have some authentic Mexican in the area now. We will definitely be back!
