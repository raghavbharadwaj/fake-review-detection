The Signature Room was just as classy as we expected, with the amazing skyline view that is literally second to none. I would have been perfectly fine just to sit there and enjoy the view, but the food was out of this world as well. I ordered the Petit Filet and it was cooked to perfection just how I ordered it. I'm no meat expert, but it must have been a great cut because it was the best steak I've had in a long time. I highly recommend this place to anyone either looking to impress or that simply has the highest standards of quality on their own.
