Service is quick without rushing. Homemade tortellini in alfredo sauce with fresh peas & prosciutto (I held that) = divine. Had a Peroni to wash it all down. Sangria (all wines) are served by the 1/4, 1/2, or liter. Had the red sangria & it was fine, nothing amazing. Overall it was a delightful little restaurant with authentic Italian taste. Noisy.
