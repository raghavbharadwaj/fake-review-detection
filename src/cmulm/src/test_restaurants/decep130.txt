My husband and I recently celebrated our 12th anniversary at the Rosemont location of Gibsons Bar and Steakhouse. This restaurant is much more elegant than anywhere we would normally go, so in spite of being excited, I was afraid we might feel out of place. This was a unnecessary worry however, and the exceptional staff made sure we were quite comfortable. We took advantage of the complimentary valet parking and were seated very quickly. We started our evening with a couple of their famous martinis...and yes they are quite large! For dinner I chose the Filet Mignon and my husband enjoyed a 13oz New York Sirloin. For desert we shared a divine chocolate hazelnut cake. The portions were very generous, the service impeccable and the food, heavenly. We will definitely be returning to Gibsons for our special occasions in the future.
