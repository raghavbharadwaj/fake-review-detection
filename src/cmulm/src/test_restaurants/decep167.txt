I always look forward to business trips to Chicago, because I know I will have the opportunity to be swept away to Italy - at least in a culinary and dining atmosphere sense - when I dine at Quartino Ristorante and Wine Bar on North State Street in downtown Chicago! I know that I can drop the worries of the day and indulge in the yummy and beautifully presented regional specialties they offer. The ambience at Quartino is always warm and welcoming, and the staff is always helpful and dedicated to providing excellent service. As for the food...on my 3 visits to Quartino, I have never found a dish I didn't like. If I had to pick my two favorites, they would be the crispy calamari with organic tomato sauce and the organic veal skirt steak, served with wild arugula, roasted grape tomatoes, and balsamic syrup. Chef Coletta and his team have put together such a sumptuous menu that limiting myself to two favorites is nearly impossible. Everything has been delicious. The prices are very reasonable, the food is fabulous, and the service is always above and beyond expectations. I would definitely recommend Quartino if you are ever in downtown Chicago.
