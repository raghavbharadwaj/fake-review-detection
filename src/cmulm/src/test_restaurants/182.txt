Dinner at sunset was lovely - fantastic view of the city and the lake. The food was fine - not fantastic, but good solid food. The prices were - even by Chicago standards - outrageous. Service was pretty good. I would probably recommend going to the bar on the 96th floor and saving your money. One pretty major downside - the trip up and down in the elevators. You'll be competing with people going to the bar and the new observation decks - getting up was no big deal, but it took us half an hour to get an elevator down!
