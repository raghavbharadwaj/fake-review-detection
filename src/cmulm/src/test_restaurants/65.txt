We made a dinner reservation for Shaw's our first night in town and I'm so glad we did. It was excellent! My husband had the perch which he enjoyed very much and I had the surf & surf which was a lobster tail and crab legs. The lobster had a little too much pepper flavor for me and seemed a little chewy but the crab legs made up for it. It was our most expensive meal in Chicago but you definitely get what you pay for. All of our other meals didn't even come close to this one!
