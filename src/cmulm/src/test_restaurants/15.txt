For this restaurant there are not enough superlatives to adequately describe it. We ordered (and shared) the Crab Cakes and Lobster Tail Tempura, accompanied by an excellent Albarino wine. Starting off, the bread basket was outstanding - 5 types of bread, of which the white roll was the only "ordinary" offering - sour dough with a chewy crust would have made it 5 for 5. The salad was served with REAL Roquefort dressing, not some blue cheese imitation. The vegetable dish, steamed asparagus with lemon-butter sauce, was absolutely perfect. The seafood was cooked to perfection, and the shared entrees divided in the kitchen and served attractively and were delicious - the lobster was just right. To finish off, the coffee service (enough for two cups each) and deserts were delectable. I had their signature Lime Key Pie, while my wife opted for a decadent half-slice (more than enough) of a chocolate fudge pie a la mode. We left there stuffed, and very, very happy. In my opinion, the meal was worth more than we paid. Our waitress was Liz Abrams - I'm sure they are all excellent, but her service was worth a special mention,
