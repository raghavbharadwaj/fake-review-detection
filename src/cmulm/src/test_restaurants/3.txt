We tried Joe's a second time while visiting Chicago. We first tried it last year and it was so delicious, we put it on our "Must try again" list. It will stay on that list. We started with the stuffed mushrooms and the Mortgage sampler for 1 - both excellent. My husband is not a seafood fan, so he ordered the rib eye steak, which he claimed to be outstanding. I had the Joe's scallops and our son had the turkey burger, both of which were delicious. We ended the evening sharing the coconut pie and peanut butter pie. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening, will absolutely return when visiting Chicago next, and heartily recommend Joe's to any and all.
