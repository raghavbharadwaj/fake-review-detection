We were so looking forward to this meal and it exceeded our expectations. We could not get a reservation at Topolo or Frontera so we lined up on Friday night at 4:50 before they opened at 5. The line moved really fast once they opened and when we got to the front they said it would be about an hour, come back to check in 40 minutes. We were starving so we went around the corner to Xoco and ordered a takeout sandwich to share. While we were waiting we saw chef Bayless in the open kitchen tasting all the dishes - what a thrill! We walked around the neighbourhood and ate our {amazing} torta, then went back to Frontera Grill and got our pager and had a drink at the bar. The coconut mojito was delicious and so was the margarita. Once we were seated the service was incredible. We mentioned an allergy and the server was very knowledgeable, then a manager came right over to check on us as well. We had the cheviche trio and duck carnitas in masa boats. These were some of the best things we've ever tasted! I wasn't as crazy about my main - pork in a creamy bacon sauce, but my husband's tacos al carbon were great. We had more cocktails with the meal and coffee afterwards and the bill was only $150 for the two of us, including tax & tip. More than 50% of that was drinks. The food is very reasonably priced. I would love to return!
