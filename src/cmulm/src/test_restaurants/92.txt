Spent 4 days in Chicago and took my wife there based on her love of Spanish/Trendy restaurants she likes. We live in Southern CA and of course many Mexican/Spanish/Nuevo restaurants there, but this restaurant hit a home run with her. She ordered the Duck with Apricot Mole and she was in heaven. I ordered the Carne Asada Brava which was this large thick flank steak in an incredible red sauce and just the right spice with black beans,guacamole and plantains. The wait is long, but try the bar because we got a spot for three, including my son who felt like a big boy(he's 12) and were in and out in just over an hour. The drinks are especially good and the bartenders are good at giving suggestions on dinner. Out of 4 days this was our favorite restaurant in town.
