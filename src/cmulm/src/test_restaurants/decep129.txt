It was my husbands birthday and we wanted to do something special. I let it be his choice and he selected Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse. While I have never been there, some of my friends have and they did nothing but rave about it. So off we went. They have a large selection of usda angus beef, which steak just happens to be my husbands favorite. While they are a bit pricy, they did live up to their name of generous portions. My husband had the Chicago Cut 22oz of pure beef. It was worth the pricey prize tag. I had the filet mignon 10oz, both steaks cooked to perfection. They also have plenty of apetizers. They had lobster, clams, and all the salads and soups to please all tastes. The service was devine. I felt like we were the only ones the waiter had to service. His name was Steve, and I would recommend sitting in his section, if given a choice. He made us feel real special. Like I said they have a full menu, chicken, king crab, tons of sides, very generous, I had lunch for the next day with all my left overs, even I have to admit, my husband for the first time ever actually had a doggie bag. I would recommend this restaurant and we will be visiting again, I assure you, I want to try it all.
