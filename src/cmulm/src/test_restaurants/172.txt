We went on Friday night to celebrate three family birthdays . There were 9 adults and a baby. What fun we had ! The food was delcious. It is served on small plates with great bread. The service was good. . They did take reservations for a large group so no wait even on a Friday night. A very enjoyable , delicious, fun experience. We will definitely go back. It is very noisy with all of the conservation about the food and the sharing so not the place if you want a quiet , romantic dinner or want to be able to have a long conversatiion at dinner with someone . It is the PERFECT place for all ages if you want to have a FUN dining experience that included great food and great wait staff ! We enjoyed how each dish comes out when it is ready so you are constantly eating something different . Kudos to Aldo , our waiter , he was wonderful It was very reasonable price wise for all the food and drink that we had ! We will go back again when we are in Chicago with family.
