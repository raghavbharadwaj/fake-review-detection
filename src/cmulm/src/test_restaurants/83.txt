Yes, it's a little pricey for "Mexican food," but don't expect your typcal Taco Bell tacos! Authentic Mexican food with earthy spices and fresh salsas. And Master Chef Rick Bayless was in the house the night of our visit! My husband and I treated my son and his partner to dinner at Frontera to celebrate a new job. We started with an assortment of appetizers, including a wonderfully tasty ceviche, tender-crisp taquitos, empanadas, and freshly-made guacamole. Then we each chose different entrees and shared tastes of each. All of our dishes were superb. Things to be aware of: The doors for dinner open at 5:20, not before, even if it's raining as it was the night we visited. Nonetheless, get there early. They don't take reservations for Frontera, and people start lining up an hour in advance.
