Really enjoyed my experience here. First thing I noticed was the atmosphere. The decor created a very rustic and older feeling, which was very nice. The waitress was with us immediately taking our order, which was awesome as it was so fast. She was very polite and fast with our drink orders. They had an amazing collection of craft beers that fit our group perfectly, and we all sampled a couple different ones. We placed our food orders and enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. When the food came out it looked unbelievable. It was displayed extremely nice, and tasted even better. Overall, the experience was amazing and I recommend the Girl and the Goat to anyone who enjoys good food, rustic atmosphere, and craft beers. Thanks!
