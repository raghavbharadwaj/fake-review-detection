We husband and I (somewhat apprehensively) took our two young sons to Frontera recently for lunch, and we had a terrific experience. The place was a bit boisterous and loud, so our kids' fit right in! And the food was incredible, as usual (my husband and I knew how good it was; at least it was when we had gone there years before, before we had kids). Our sons devoured the guacamole, and there was a good kids' menu. And when one of our sons tipped over his water glass (of course), the staff was quick with towels and extra napkins, and didn't seem the least bit put off. We felt so comfortable there we even stayed for dessert (a wonderful pecan pie split between my husband and me, and the ice cream sandwich for our sons).
