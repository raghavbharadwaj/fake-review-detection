I had a great meal at Shaw's. I know from the reviews that the bar side is the livelier but I was seated in the dining room. The bar side did look like it was a bit more energetic, but it was also completely packed. I liked having somewhere to set my glass. Though I enjoyed everything I ordered the oysters really stole the show. Their champagne mignionette is amazing. And the oysters were fresh and delicious. For teh entree I ordered a smapler with shrimp, scallops and a crab cake. They were all delicious. I am not sure how to describe the sauce that came with the crab cake but it highlighted the dish wonderfully without gettign in the way of the real star - the crab. For the beer lovers out there you should also know that Shaw's is one of the very (very) few places I have been that has Stiegl on tap. This is a great beer from Austria that is difficult to find but well worth it. Show up 30 minutes early and have a Stiegl at the bar before dinner.
