Very professional, inviting atmosphere. What struck me most about The Purple Pig was not necessarily its food, but the presentation. The food was great, but what really sold me on this restaurant was the way the owners and the employees presented themselves. Everybody with whom we interacted was very polite (some were quite sociable, and in a positive way), yet the decor and the architecture really painted an atmosphere of great energy and liveliness that fit the city around me.
