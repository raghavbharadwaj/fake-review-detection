I dined at Shaw's Crab House for the first time for Sunday Brunch last week, to celebrate a birthday. New to Chicago, I was looking for a place to get sea food done right, and I sure found it! Shaw's is fantastic! The ambiance is beautiful and welcoming, and makes you feel at home, as does the friendly staff. The brunch buffet was the best sea food buffet I have ever had. The selection was fantastic, and everything was cooked perfectly. The Alaskan King Crab Legs were the king of my plate, but I think I tried a little of everything. I am just glad they didn't have to roll me out of the restaurant! They also have a cold sea food bar, an omelet and waffle station, and breakfast cocktails. At $55 per person, Shaw's Crab House is a little on the pricey side. But for special occasions when you want to celebrate, it is worth it!
