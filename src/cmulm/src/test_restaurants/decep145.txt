My wife and I ate here recently for our anniversary, and we thought the ambiance was lovely. I had the roasted pickles, which I have never had, and quite enjoyed the savory flavor. My wife chose the sauteed green beans which she thought were tasty and a healthy option. I also had the pan roasted halibut, which was cooked well, and the white asparagus served with it was flavored well and not bitter, compared to white asparagus I've had in the past. Their wine selection was quite good, and we shared a bottle of Endrizzi Chardonnay. Altogether, this was a pleasant dining experience and I would recommend it to others.
