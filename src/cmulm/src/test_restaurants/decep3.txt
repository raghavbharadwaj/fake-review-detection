Joe's is my favorite place to relax after work. The bartender there makes great cocktails and when I get hungary, I like to have their classic cheeseburger at the bar. The seafood here is really good, especially the stone crabs. My wife likes the grilled tomatoes and Ahi Tuna, which has a wasabi kick. Service is fast and attentive, but the waiters also know how to let you be when you want. They don't hover. The decor is classic, but updated. . .dark wood, white linens, soft lighting and black and white photos on the wall. On weekends, this place really heats up, but I like to come on weeknights when it's less crowded.
