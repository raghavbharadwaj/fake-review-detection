I had just recently moved to Chicago and saw this fabulous seafood restaurant around the corner from my apartment. Being from Vancouver and having access to fresh seafood all the time, I immediately requisitioned a few friends to try out Joe's Seafood last night. It was a hit! The host immediately seated us when we walked through the door, and the decor was great - simple and elegant. While we browsed the menu (did I say extensive?), we had ordered a bottle of white wine (from Napa Valley!) to accompany our meals. I couldn't choose, so I got the fisherman's platter following an appetizer of shrimp & scallop ceviche. My god! Even Maria, who's Peruvian, thought it was amazing. My friends got the stone crab and Chilean sea bass, and my boyfriend, Jeff, being the type of guy he is, went for the rib-eye. The prices were just right, and the food was excellent! We easily spent three hours here, finishing our meals and catching up. I was sorely tempted to get dessert, but by the end of our meals, I was so full that I made plans to come back on my own the next day. Oh, they do take-out AND have a gluten free menu - what's not to love? The service is great, and the menu has a lot of food that even the pickiest eater would have trouble finding fault with. My only complaint would be that there were no pictures on the menu (I'm a visual type of person), so it was hard to gauge the portions. All in all, this place comes highly recommended - you won't be disappointed. Make reservations in advance!
