The food was so good. We ordered the buffalo shrimp with blue cheese coleslaw and it was the favorite at the table. I also had the ribs which were great too. The story here is the service. It was fathers day and our waiter, a working father, was so welcoming from the time we sat down. He made the dining experience a pleasure. At the end of our meal we had a couple left over rolls and had asked if he could wrap up the rolls for us to go. Our waiter said he would bring out fresh rolls for us. We told him it wasn't necessary, we were just not looking to waste the left over rolls and hoping to give to one of the homeless men we passed on our walk to lunch. Before we know it, our waiter comes out with a take home container and a to go soda to give to the homeless man. We looked in and instead of our rolls, he had a full cheeseburger and fries. Random act of kindness - it was a nice ending to a wonderful lunch.
