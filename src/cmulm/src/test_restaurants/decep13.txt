I went here for dinner on Fathers Day and I was really pleased with the special they offered. It included appetizer, main dish and even desert. I also thought it was cool how they sent my dad home with a free gift of Joes steak spice. My dad had a good time as well and the pricing was pretty descent. I definelty recommend this restaurant and I am sure ill be back too.
