My husband and I had a very pleasant lunch at Shaw's yesterday. Upon our arrival, we were greeted with smiles and our reservation was located quickly. We were led to our table immediately and I was impressed at how clean and inviting the place was. Our order of Lobster Cocktails, Tuna Sushi/Asian Salad and the Crab Cake Burger was taken promptly. We sipped our drinks and enjoyed the quiet, upscale atmosphere while we waited. Before we knew it, our server was delivering our food. Unlike much of the seafood we have tried before, this was fresh and quite delicious! My salad was fresh as well. Overall, a delightful experience. We will be back often.
