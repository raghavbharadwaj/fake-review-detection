After months of planning and putting off, I finally found myself seated at a table in Chicago's much talked about hot spot, Girl and the Goat. The restaurant is both elegant and eclectic at the same time creating a symphony for the senses even before the meal. I started out with the fried pickles I'd heard so much about, and let me tell you the accolades were not unfounded. Delightful little treats that had me eagerly wanting more. Now normally I'm all for a steak, but this night I was feeling quite bold, so throwing caution to the wind I ordered escargot Ravioli featured on the evenings menu. Although not sure what to expect, I have but one word, amazing! Chef Stephanie Izard is a true master of the culinary arts and deserves all the accolades she has received and more. Unfortunately my time was short and waist line was expanding so desert had to be skipped, but should I get back to Chicago, I can promise you Girl and the Goat will be a must stop on my list.
