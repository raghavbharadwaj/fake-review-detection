There are lots of places to get steaks in Chicago . . .but getting a great steak? That is a lot harder - unless you go to Joe's. We try and go every time we have out of town guests because there is no better way to showcase Chicago style steakhouses than Joe's. On the last visit, I had the seared Ahi tuna. It was a sushi grade cut of tuna, barely shown the grill before meeting my plate and arrived promptly. It was one of the best cuts of tuna I have ever had - almost as good as one on the beach overseas where I pointed to the tuna on a boat and it was cut and cooked on the beach. The tuna was that fresh. On prior visits, I've also had the salmon, chicken, and the ribeye. Service usually excellent, and the waiters are quite knowledgeable about wine pairings. Overall, I am always looking for an excuse to go back to Joe's!
