Weber Grill Restaurant has it all! From the delicious food to the daily drink specials and live music on Friday nights to the friendly staff, you will not be dissatisfied. The Grilled Oysters Rockefeller was the perfect entree and I'm still thinking about the steak I ate... I will definitely return!
