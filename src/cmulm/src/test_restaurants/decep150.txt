I and several coworkers were in Chicago on business; after we closed the deal, the locals recommended this place (Girl and the Goat) when we asked for a good place to relax and celebrate. We decided to give it a try. The place is in the West Loop, glad we were using transit since parking would have been iffy. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but took that as a good sign, since the place was packed and busy. I checked out the menu on my phone while we waited, I liked that many of the entree listings include where the ingredients were sourced from, and links to read more about these places. Our server was friendly and fast, and the actual restaurant was comfortable and clean. It was obviously a very popular local place. We tried a few different craft beers, I had a Great Lakes Eliot Ness. Much better than having a Budweiser at a chain restaurant! Menu has vegetable, fish, or meat choices; we had the wood grilled broccoli, Skuna Bay salmon, and I had the crisp braised pork. Didn't take nearly as long as we expected, given how busy they were, and the food was fantastic! Great service, good booze and food, nice place, and the bill was very reasonable. We're definitely eating here again when in Chicago.
