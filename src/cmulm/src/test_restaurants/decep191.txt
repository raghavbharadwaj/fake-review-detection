My husband and I recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at The Signature Room at the 95th. We made a reservation weeks in advance using their online reservation tool. The process was incredibly easy and user friendly. We arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early and were greeted by a very friendly and respectful hostess. She showed us our table, a private affair in the back corner of the facility. The table settings were beautiful and the overall atmosphere was elegant and exactly what we were looking for. The hostess gave us our menus and politely informed us who our server would be that evening. Our server was a well dressed young man who was polite and articulate. He made a few suggestions on what to choose and helped us with wine pairings. After ordering, he respectfully left us alone. It was lovely to spend time with my husband in such a formal atmosphere, it made our evening something very memorable. When presented with our food I was very impressed with how beautiful the presentation was! It was stunning, so artfully plated, I almost did not want to eat it! The taste and quality of the food can not be compared to anything I've had before. It was delicious! The suggested wine paired wonderfully with the dish as well. Our night went better than I could have hoped. The staff and food at The Signature Room at the 95th met and exceeded my expectations! five stars!
