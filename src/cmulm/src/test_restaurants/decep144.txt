I just tried Girl and the Goat for the first time and was blown away! When you first walk in you're greeted with friendly staff and long, wooden, family-style table seating. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the menu is filled with craft beers and and veggie/fish/meat entrees. Everything we ate was so fresh! We (my girlfriend and I) started with the roasted cauliflower. Pickled beets and peppers popped in your mouth with every bite! My girlfriend loved her scallops and charred pork belly was to die for. We will be back soon, because everything on the menu deserves to be tried at least once!
