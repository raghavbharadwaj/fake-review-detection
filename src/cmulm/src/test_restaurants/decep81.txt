Shaw's Crab House was just what my girlfriend and I were looking for for our anniversary. They have everything here from seafood, to steak, to brunch. We entered the restaurant and were kindly greeted by the hostess who quickly took us to a very nice table. They even brought us a bottle of wine on the house because it was our anniversary! The waiter was prompt and polite. My girlfriend ordered the steak and I ordered the yellowtail snapper. Both were fantastic! For dessert we ordered the triple layer chocolate cake which was a perfect end to a great dinner. 5/5 We will definitely be coming back again!
