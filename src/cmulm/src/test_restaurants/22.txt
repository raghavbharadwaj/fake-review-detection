I came here with no expectations - it was my boyfriend's choice as he is a bear's fan. The service was great, it was a quiet night and our waiter, Jeff, chatted to us about all sorts - really friendly, knowledgable and helpful. He even sorted me out a complimentary Mountain Dew as I had never tasted it before! Be warned - go here hungry - the portions are HUGE! To start we shared a tuna and avocado roll - it was sushi style - and gorgeous. Try it! I had BBQ Salmon as a main and my boyfriend had the restaurant's signature dish - Pork chop, served with cherry sauce and sweet potato mash. The pork chop was the biggest I have ever seen and it was cooked to perfection. The sweety potato mash and cherry sauce went perfectly. The salmon came with a sweetcorn relish - which was lovely and some sort of corn cake - which I wasn't keen on, but it didn't matter because the salmon steak was so big! After a long rest we shared a banana cream pie which did not dissapoint! I couldn't move after the meal! It is a great place for a celebration or family meal. Prices start off at about $11 for a 'Fridge' Burger and range up to about $50 for a 30oz steak! There is all sorts of interesting sporting memorabilia on the walls to look at and you can even buy a 'Steak Sauce' to take home!
