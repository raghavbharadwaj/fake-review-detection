We had read positive reviews on Trip Advisor before leaving home, so we decided to give the Purple Pig a try. We arrived at the restaurant (conveniently located on 500 block of Mag Mile) just before 5:00 on a Friday afternoon and it was already packed! A quick 15 minute wait and we were seated at a long table on the covered patio next to other families/couples. This really contributed to our enjoyment of the meal, as we were able to see other diner's selections and share a little chit-chat with friendly strangers. It felt almost European. The plates are small which is perfect for trying many items. Our kids were very good about trying different selections, but probably the chorizo sausage was their favourite. The chicken thighs on a skewer were melt-in-your-mouth good, as was the caesar salad and beets with goat cheese. The service was quick which was amazing considering how busy they were, and the clientele seemed to be a mix of young urban downtown workers and families. Probably lots of parents feel frustrated that the only options for children on menus involve hamburgers or chicken nuggets with french fries. I know we were glad to see our kids enjoying some vegetables! We would definitely eat here, again.
