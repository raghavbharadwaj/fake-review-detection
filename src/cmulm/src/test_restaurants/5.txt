We LOVE Joe's! We go whenever we are in Las Vegas, and knew that we would also go while we visited Chicago. Our first day in Chicago we walked in to see if we could get a supper reservation for that night. They were booked solid until 3 nights later... a reservation is a MUST!! the food is a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. the atmosphere is wonderful, and the service is absolutely FANTASTIC!! We each had Fillet and Crab legs which were delicious! the Peanut Butter pie is an absolute must! We will definitely eat here again!
