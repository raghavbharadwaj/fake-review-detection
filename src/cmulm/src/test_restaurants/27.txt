While on a short vacation to Chicago, took my wife, our oldest daughter (college aged) and my wife's parents to Ditka's. We were glad that we made reservations, because there was a long line for those without--but we were seated right away. It was a Friday night, and both football and baseball was on the many televisions, which really ramped up the volume of the place, so I wouldn't consider it for a romantic dinner, or if a lot of business needed to be discussed. Our server was Kyle, who has worked there for almost two years, and I'd ask for him again if I went back. The food was terrific all around, with very large servings. I had the double pork chop (delicious), my FiL had the ribs (looked like two slabs), my wife had a steak, daughter had the half-chicken, and MiL had the fish and chips. Nobody had room for dessert, and we were still full when it came to breakfast the next day. Lots of sports memorabilia on the walls throughout the place.
