Wow! My friends had been talking about Quartino's, but I had never been. I finally went last night with a couple of friends. I have definitely been missing out! The atmosphere is fun and exiting and the staff is friendly and go out of their way to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. The food? It was to die for. Perfection. Definitely a 5 star experience for me. I'll be back, and often!
