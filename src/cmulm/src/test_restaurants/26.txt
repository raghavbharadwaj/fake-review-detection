Ditka's Restaurant is a higher end sports restaurant/bar. Polished woodwork and very tasteful sports displays of interest to all, on two floors. Lots of interesting rooms, a bar section and a restaurant. Great food and impeccable service. We felt welcome and at home. Attached to our hotel, we visited more that twice during our stay. Particularly likeable is their Sunday brunch.
