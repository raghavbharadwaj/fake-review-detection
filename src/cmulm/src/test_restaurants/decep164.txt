Chef John Coletta of Quartino (Chicago) has outdone himself. His curious and interesting selection of how to prepare dishes leave the taste buds satisfied, such as the Ravioli stuffed with braised pork, speck and fava beans. If you are a wine/cheese pairing novice, ask the staff to choose for you as their knowledge is quite in-depth. We were quite happy with the size of the portions - not too large, not too small. Also, the salad selections were varied and had something for everyone - from beets to naval oranges to walnuts and house-made burrata. Lastly, the ambience of the restaurant is refreshing and not stuffy as sometimes places can be when they offer a truly upscale menu. We recommend, if there's room, sitting out on the charming and cozy patio deck overlooking the street. It's a great way to people watch and get some fresh air, while enjoying a spectacular meal!
