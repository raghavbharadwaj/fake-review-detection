Best steak in Chicago! We started with the Crabmeat and Avocado, it was fresh and absolutely mouth watering. For dinner, I ordered the 10oz Filet Mignon, they also offer a 14oz. The steak was cooked perfectly, it was tender , juicy, and the flavor did not disappoint. We barely saved room for dessert but couldn't pass it up. We had be told how delicious there pies are and to try atleast one. Our server warned us about the massive portions, so we decided to split the macadamia turtle pie. It was to die for! It was the perfect balance of rich, creamy, and sweet. I was tempted to order one to go! We will definitely be back.
