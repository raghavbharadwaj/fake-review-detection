I had the pleasure of lunching at Frontera on Friday 6-8-12. My sister, her boyfriend and myself were prepared to wait the 45 minutes for a table but as we were waiting for drinks from the bar 3 people just happened to be leaving. Score! We started with the salsa and chips, guacamole and the queso fundido with shortribs. The queso was phenomenal! My sister's boyfriend damn near licked the crock clean-it's that good. For lunch I had the Frontera Classic Trio, my sister had catfish tacos and her boyfriend had the Frontera Street Trio. All three of us cleaned oour plates! It is a little bit spendy but soooo worth it. You can check out the menu on the restaurants website to get acclimated to the prices and the offerings. Don't miss out on this place it's worth every penny!
