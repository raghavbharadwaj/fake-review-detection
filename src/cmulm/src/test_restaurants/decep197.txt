On Saturday, June 15,2013 My friends and i had the pleasure of visiting "The Signature Room At The 95th." The restraunt is reminiscant of a scene you would see out of a 40"s gangster movie,with its silk table cloths, fine crystal wine glasses, and fresh cut roses on every table. The Signature Room At The 95 Th has an equally classic menu from hand cut steaks, to more intricate stuffed fillet mignon, to simple desserts, to flombe there is something on the menu to appease even the most finicky of pallets.I ordered a steak medium rare, with a greek salad and chose a cabernet sauvignon from italy from the extensive windlist, that features italian and german red and white wines.The signature Room at the 95th, features classic entrees with a diversisified selection of wine , sure to appease everyone on a Saturday night,when the only question im hungey, where do we go? The answer of course is The Sigature Room At the 95th.
