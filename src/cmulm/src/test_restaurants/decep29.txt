I recently went to Chicago to visit an old family friend who needed my help. While I was there, they suggested we go out to eat at Mike Ditka's. I was surprised at the speed with which we were helped. There was a small line, but we got our table extremely quickly, and were promptly greeted by our server. He suggested some specials, took our drink orders, and left us to peruse the menu. Shortly after we had decided, the waiter returned and gave us some complimentary bread, then took our orders. I had decided to order the Angus Prime Rib, and my friend ordered the Filet Mignon Two Ways. Our food came out much faster than I had expected, and was delicious! I had originally thought the price was steep for what I was getting, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the portion size was very generous. It would have been worth it for the flavor of the food alone. My steak was done to absolute perfection, the very definition of medium-rare. My friend's steak was likewise pristine. I got to try a bit of his order as well, and was again taken aback by how delicious it was. All in all, our experience was absolutely spectacular. I would give them 5/5 stars for service, cleanliness, helpfulness, flavor, and portion size. Unfortunately, I didn't see any desserts, which was a shame as I would have enjoyed getting to hang out a little longer in the warm, inviting environment of the restaurant. I will definitely be visiting again, and will be suggesting to anyone in the area: Visit Mike Ditka's, you will not be disappointed!
