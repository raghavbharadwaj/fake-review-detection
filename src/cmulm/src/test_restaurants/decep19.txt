I absolutely love Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab! The first time I went there was with my friend who invited me and I can't get enough of it ever since. The restaurant itself is very elegant but the atmosphere is still very laid back and enjoyable. The food is delicious. My favorite dish is the Filet Mignon. You really do get a bang for your buck at this place because not only is the great but the service is also excellent and fast.
