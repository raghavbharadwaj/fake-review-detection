My boyfriend saw Weber Grill on TV and, being about as carnivorous as they come, wanted to go to Chicago JUST to eat there. Neither one of us was disappointed. We came in on a Sunday night, nearly time for closing, and a bit tipsy. We were the only non-employees in this behemoth of a restaurant and we were warmly greeted and promptly seated. Our waitress Austra was very nice and the head chef came out to talk to us, probably after having observed my boyfriend checking out the giant grills in the kitchen. The employees were engaging without being irritating (not the kind of waitstaff that comes and sits down at your table to take your order). The place was clean and our meal: a steak with potatoes, appetizers, one drink for each of us, and a burger and fries, came to less than $80. Very pleasant experience. Good location. I would definitely go again. I rated it 4 stars (Very Good) because the steak didn't really blow me away. But it WAS good and my overall experience was AWESOME. Great atmosphere and friendly, attentive waitstaff. Not a rude person in the bunch.
