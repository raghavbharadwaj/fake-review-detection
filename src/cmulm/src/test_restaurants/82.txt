I've read many of Rick Bayless' cookbooks, and watched him on TV several times, so I've been wanting to come to his restaurant for awhile. It's hard for me to judge this place, as I grew up in the Southwest used to a certain type of Mexican food. Bayless tries to feature the many aspects of Mexican cuisine, and his use of roasted chilies and limes are very noticeable in the food. The food at Frontera Grill is refined and the flavors are very deep. Some of the ingredients tasted like they were fresh out of the garden. It is obvious that the restaurant cares about the quality of ingredients it puts on its menu. That being said, it is very different, and in some aspects less comforting than the spicy stews and braised pork enchiladas I grew up with in New Mexico. I never thought I would leave a Mexican meal feeling like I ate "light."
