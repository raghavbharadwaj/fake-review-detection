If you're looking for the best seafood in Chicago, you have to go to Shaw's Crab House. The menu of items is endless and almost overwhelming. Not only does restaurant offer traditional seafood dishes and appetizers, but they also have an incredible sushi menu to choose from and to satisfy any seafood craving. The lobster, avocado and cucumber roll is my favorite. As for the rest of the menu, I've tried the Broiled Lake Michigan Whitefish and Grilled Alaskan Halibut and loved them both, and would easily recommend them to anyone. I would definitely order each again, but with so many plates to choose from, I also want to try them all. There are also non-seafood options if you're going out with people who do not prefer seafood, but honestly this place is best enjoyed by those who love seafood. The atmosphere is also incredible and so is the wait staff. You will surely have an incredible time at Shaw's and I would easily give the restaurant a 5/5.
