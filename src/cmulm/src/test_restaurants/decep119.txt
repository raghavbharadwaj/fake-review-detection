My family and I very seldom have a chance to really get out and enjoy good restaurants as we mainly rely on home cooked meals 90% of the time. If we do, it's something quick and simple. There's nothing better than a great burger and I have to say that Mushroom Swiss burger was absolutely amazing to say the least. Being a cook myself, this was as if I'd made it myself and I am truly glad that we decided to stop and have lunch! We will definitely go back again.
