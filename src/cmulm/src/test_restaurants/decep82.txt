I really liked eating here. They have the best crabs in town and they are the best type of quality. They make sure to boil the crabs and serve them at the exact right temperature. The way that they prepare the food is also different from many other restaurants. They make sure to only use the finest ingredients and make it taste good. I really loved this place because they also had great customer service. The people that served us were very friendly and they made sure to talk to us. They talked to me and my kid which made me very happy. Overall it is a great family restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone!
