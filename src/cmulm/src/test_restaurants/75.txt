As I have just found out that I have a multitude of food allergies with gluten, dairy and weirdly rice topping the list, it was nice to go to a restaurant where the gluten free menu did not consist solely of salads and bland meat dishes. The GF menu isn't huge but definitely bigger than most, and I was excited to have a substantial amount of options to choose from. Although pricey, the Maine lobster dish I had was tasty, a good portion size, and accompanied with flavorful seasonal vegetables. We chose to the sit in the bar area for the more low key dining experience but the service was just as good as if we had been eating off of a white table cloth. The waiter was extremely attentive and our food was placed in front us 20 minutes after ordering with at least two checks-ups while we were dining. The only sub-par piece of the meal was the Greens salad which I would replace with another GF vegetable dish. Over-all my experience at Shaw's was extremely pleasant and I am already looking forward to trying the crab on my next visit!
