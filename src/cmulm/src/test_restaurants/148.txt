I digress. GATG was great and creative food, good prices, well worth it.;. i, however, have disappointment with intimidating with over-the-top know-it-all wait staff who act like authorities but really don't know something but will just say something authoritative and intimidating. Our smuggish wait person told us that the reason their craft beer was not cold was "we serve it only cooled" (rudely, with no further explanation offered, as though that is the foodie way and you are a jerk/dolt to think otherwise). Well, i do know my beer stuff (including the ways of the British) and good beer is served very cold if it is to be served properly. Second example- I asked the smuggish wait person about an ingredient- she never came back with an answer, so I asked another server, who went to the chef and promptly returned with an answer. Later the wait person remembered and came with the "answer"- she'd obviously made it up and it was totally the opposite of the first answer to that question. One could say this is a bad apple wait person...or one could say that it is a filter down issue of improper and inadequate training at this high level restaurant. Lastly, the music is deliberately very loud- everyone in the place is always needing to shout to be heard- but this is, i suppose, part of the new 21st century "cool". Enjoy the place- but beware the arrogant wait staff!!
