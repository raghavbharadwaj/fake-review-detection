Satisfying All Around I had dinner at Gibsons last Thursday and can't say enough good things about this place. I eat here at least once a month and they never disappoint. When we arrived for dinner we did not have a reservation, but we were greeted right away by an effecient hostess who led us directly to the patio. I guess being a group of only two we lucked out and got to sit outside. Our waiter was fast and friendly, he chatted with us a bit, but was not too overwhelming. My steak, as always, was cooked to perfection and my guest enjoyed his as well. Great food, great staff and great patio- I will be back again during this summer!
