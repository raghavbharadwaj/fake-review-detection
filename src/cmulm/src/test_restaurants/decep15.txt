Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. I consider myself to be a true foodie and I am consistently blown away by the quality of food and level of service at Joe's. It is truly what upscale dining should be. I have been to Joe's many times and have never had a bad experience. I look forward to many visits to Joe's in the future.
