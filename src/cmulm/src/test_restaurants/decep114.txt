I went to Weber Grill last night with my boyfriend and we had a great time! The live music made the whole atmosphere cool and the food was to die for! The Plank Grilled Chilean Sea Bass practically melted in my mouth and the vinaigrette dressing added a really nice touch. The asparagus was crisp but not crunchy and the recommended wine really kissed my palette! My boyfriend had the Prime NY Strip and said that was amazing too. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great, upscale night out! The food is affordable for the atmosphere and quality, and anyone can easily lose themselves in a great time.
