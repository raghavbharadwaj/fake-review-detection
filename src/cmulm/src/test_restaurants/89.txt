I dined at Frontera on a Saturday night around 10:45. The service was outstanding and did not rush us even though it was close to closing time. The waiter picked up quickly that my friend was a vegetarian and pointed him to the veg friendly items on the menu. I enjoyed my fish tacos and my friend had the portobello mushroom tacos. The guacamole was outstanding, as were the grilled veggies and peppers. The catfish could have been better seasoned, but was fine. We drank Goose Island Marisol on draft which was an excellent complement to the food. I try not to pay too close attention to hype, but this place has always been recommended and it did meet my expectations.
