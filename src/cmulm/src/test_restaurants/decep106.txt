I recently visited the Weber Grill Restaurant with my husband for a special 50th anniversary dinner. I was very pleasantly surprised with the service that we received, it was exceptional! We found ourselves surrounded by a lovely atmosphere and smiles everywhere we turned. The food was delicious as well, ( I had the Prime New York Strip ) which I highly recommend. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and you could really taste the difference that the charcoal grilling made in the flavor of the meat. We will certainly be back again!
