I visited Shaw's twice on a recent visit to Chicago in May. It was absolutley fantastic on both occasions and I can't recommend it enough. On both visits I ate in the 'Oyster Bar' which is on the right as you enter the restarant. I did not get a chance to eat in the main restaurant, which looked quite smart but had seriously big queues waiting to get in, even at 7.30 pm. The Oyster Bar is basically an old fashioned bar with a few tables in it, the atmosphere is relaxed but busy and the waiting staff are attentive but not overly so. The bar offers an extensive range of seafood, no surprise there then! But the staff will be able to tell you what is in season etc. I had the home made crab cakes, very tasty, and on the second visit I had fresh, steamed lobster, which cost around $35.00 for a one and half pound lobster, which was excellent. The bar also offers a good range of beers and spirits, the local Goose Island Honkers is very good. There is no dress code for the bar, I don't know about the main restaurant. My top tip is...get there early (6.30'ish) if you want a seat, the place was packed by 7.30 and I don't know if you can book or not. The fact that the place is so popular with the locals speaks for itself, you won't be dissapointed.
