This weekend on a road trip to Chicago I took my mom to Joe's for Birthday/Mom's Day treat, after reading the great reviews on this site. Good choice! Though we called too late for reservations on a hopping Friday night, we found two cozy seats at the bar and enjoyed amazing cocktails while waiting (not long!) for our dinners. The steaks were perfectly done, fork tender, and my mom's lobster also was perfectly grilled. We also had broccolini and asparagus sides, also done to a turn. We enjoyed every bite but couldn't finish our portions so had the leftovers boxed. Only trouble was, when we arrived home we discovered that my mom's partial portion of filet and lobster was missing - a culinary tragedy! I called up and explained the problem to the evening manager, who very kindly arranged for us to pick up a replacement before leaving town the next day. I called the next day to confirm and the daytime manager was just as wonderful. We picked up the replacement, beautifully packaged, and they even included a to-go bread basket! We went to Joe's for the food, but we'll return for that, plus the over-the-top wonderful service. Thanks to managers Sean and Eric and their wonderful staff!
