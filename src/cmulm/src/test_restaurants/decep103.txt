I'm a big fan of bbq. Every Sunday as a family we enjoy grilling, but those days when we don't feel like cooking we make our way to the Weber Grill Restaurant. They have everything imagined my favorite are the ribs. It's a friendly environment for the whole family. They even have an awesome happy hour. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't know what they want to eat. I love coming to Webers Grill so much that it's makes me never want to cook on Sundays.
