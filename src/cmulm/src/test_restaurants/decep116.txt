Great atmosphere and service! Reasonably priced with an extensive menu for all ages and tastes. The Weber Starter Sampler was unbelievably good - hickory BBQ ribs just melt in your mouth. Grilled-fried pizza was out of this world and is a new favorite. Definitely will return for lunch and dinner in the future.
