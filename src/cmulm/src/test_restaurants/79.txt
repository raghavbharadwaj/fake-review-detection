Celebrated our wedding anniversary at Shaw's on a recent Saturday evening while visiting Chicago. The service was excellent as was our meal. Our server made several outstanding recommendations for both food and wine. The seafood was as good as I've had on either the East or West Coast. They did a great job of making our anniversary dinner a special event which isn't easy to do in a large busy restuarant!
