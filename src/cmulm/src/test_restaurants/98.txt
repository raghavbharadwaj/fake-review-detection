Topolobampo is an excellent Mexican restaurant with flavorful food and excellent margaritas. This trip was our second time at Topolobampo and it did not disappoint. The summer margarita made with cucumbers was mixed to perfection. The watermelon mojito was a very refreshing drink as well for a mojito lover. We started with ceviche, which is one of their specialties. I had a scallop and crab meat ceviche, which was bursting in flavor. The problem with most ceviches are that they either have too much citrus, or not enough. The ceviche was made perfectly. For my main course, I had lobster made with two types of garlic. It was fantastic. The lobster was moist and came out of the shell easily. The best is when I took a piece of lobster and swirled it around in the garlic sauce. Very flavorful. It also came with some barley that had some of the garlic sauce. Very flavorful as well. For dessert, we had a pistachio cake with pistachio nuts on the side and creme fraiche. This was fantastic. It did not last on the plate long. The service was also really good. Attentive, but they did not hound over your shoulder. They gave you enough time to eat each course. Topolobampo is next door to Frontera Grill and they share the same entrance. Frontera Grill is the more casual of the two restaurants. One would expect the noise to filter into the Topolobampo side, but it was really not that loud. For a restaurant of this caliber, the portion sizes are fairly big. Come on an empty stomach. Rick Bayless will not disappoint.
