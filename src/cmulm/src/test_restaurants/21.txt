I'd booked a room for my daughter and myself at The Tremont at 100 Chestnut. I knew it was a charming little boutique hotel but had no idea there would also be a fabulous restaurant at the hotel. On our first day there, someone told us that Iron Mike lives in a nearby highrise and visits his restaurant often. We could tell why when we dined there on 4th of July evening. I'm a big fan of the meatloaf at Ted's Montana Grill, so I had to try out the meatloaf at Ditka's. It was so astonishing looking that people at other tables gasped and then they ordered it too. It arrives as a large stack with a polenta-like cornbread on the bottom, two slice of meatloaf on top of that, with a Ditka BBQ sauce, then herbed mashed potatoes on top of that, and thin sliced onions at the penultimate ... with drizzled red sauce and green onion sprinkles. It taste fabulous. Move over Ted's. So, huge that I could only eat a little over half. I had to save room for the Creme Brulee'. If a restaurant serves Creme Brulee', I always evaluate it. This one was quite good. But maybe not as good as the Meatloaf stack. The wait staff was extremely good. When my daughter could not decide between a Caramel Apple Martini and a Chocolate Martini, the waiter came back after a discussion with the bar staff and asked her if she would like to have a combination of the two. The resulting product was awesome. The night we dined there a group of mom, dad, and little baseball players were at a big table that seated maybe 8 people. Everyone in the group seemed very happy with the food and the sports themed memorabilia.
