Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse offered a wide variety of food on their menu. Scenery was excellent and the staff was polite. Food was great and the wait time was little. The bar offered a large variety of alcohol and the restaurant was very clean. Located in a convenient part of Chicago. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
