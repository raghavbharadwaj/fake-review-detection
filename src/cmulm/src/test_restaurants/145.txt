I called for reservations a few days before our Saturday visit, fully aware that we probably wouldn't be able to get reservations. The hostess was extremely nice and told me if we arrived when they opened at 4:30 we should be able to get a seat. That's what we did and we got in without a problem. Our experience was outstanding. Our server, Brennan, really made our night that much better. Besides having a personality that fit well with ours, he was knowledgeable about all facets of the restaurant and took his time explaining details we asked about. The kohirabi salad is a can't be missed starter. We also enjoyed the wood grilled broccoli and the pig face. We had an amazing dinner and can't wait to go back with friends!
