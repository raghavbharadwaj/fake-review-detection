Staying at a hotel close to Gibson's, we popped into the restaurant without a reservation one recent weekday afternoon and were glad we did! They were busy, but able to supply a table instantly. Seated at a spacious banquette in the thick of the lunchtime crowd, my husband, teenage son and I enjoyed a terrific lunch of steak sandwiches and their special Bookbinder's soup, all delicious. My sandwich, which was the French Dip, was outstanding and loaded with meat. My son's Rib Eye was a hit, accompanied by fantastic crispy fries, enough for us to share. The service was excellent. Nearby tables seemed to be enjoying themselves and the food in this old world Chicago atmopshere. Seems there were a lot of loyal regulars there too. This is a solid restaurant with professional staff. We loved it.
