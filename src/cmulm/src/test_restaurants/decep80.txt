I love Shaw's. I go there all the time with friends and family. It is so good! I am always pleased with the service I receive, and the food is terrific. There is so much to choose from (large menu). The food is always fresh and delicious. Their dessert menu is outstanding, too. The location is quite convenient. If you're looking for a classy seafood restaurant in a great location in Chicago, then Shaw's is the place. I would highly recommend. Go for lunch and try the Parmesan Crusted George's Bank Haddock - it's to die for!
