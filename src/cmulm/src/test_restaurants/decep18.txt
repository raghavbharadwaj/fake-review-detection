My overall impression of Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab was very positive. The restaurant's atmosphere was very active and lively which I seemed to enjoy. I have no problem whether if the restaurant is busy or not. The customers also seem to really enjoy the specials of the restaurant and the prime steak. The cook always does a good job so rarely customers bring up any problems. This restaurant does a fantastic job.
