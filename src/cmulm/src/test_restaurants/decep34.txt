All I can say is WOW! I went to this restaurant last week with some friends and I had such a wonderful time. The atmosphere was super comfortable and the wait staff was extremely friendly. The steak I ordered was cooked to perfection and all of the sides were wonderful! My friend's salmon plate smelled really tasty too. I just wish I could have tried everything on the menu ;) The priced were very reasonable too. I would definitely recommend Mike Ditka's to everyone. I cannot wait to return with more of my friends and family. - Clean - Friendly - Reasonably Priced - Fast Service - Perfect Food
