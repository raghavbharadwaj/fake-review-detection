I took my fiance to Girl & the Goat for his birthday recently, having heard rave reviews about the restaurant's craft beers and amazing entrees. We were not disappointed. The service was stellar, and the food was out of this world. The chef even made an appearance at our table to bring out dessert. By the way, the Miso Butterscotch Budino is divine. If you haven't tried it yet, get thee to Girl & the Goat at once.
