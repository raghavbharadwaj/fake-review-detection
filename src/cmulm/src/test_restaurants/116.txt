We just came back from another great weekend in Chicago. We go to the Weber Grill every time. In a city with ridiculously priced steakhouses, this place is a gem. This time, we had ribs, and they were awesome. If you do go, try to stop in on a Sunday afternoon during football season. They run burger specials, $5, if memory serves me correctly. And I can say it is one of the best burgers you will ever eat in your life. After all, if Weber's can't make a good burger, no one can! Also, they have a Bloody Mary special too. Enjoy, you can thank me later LOL.
