My husband and I stumbled upon Gibson's by accident in downtown Chicago. You know how it is when you try a new place, is it really going to be worth the money? Well, it was, the food was amazing. The prime rib and double baked potato were amazing and we shared chocolate mousse for dessert. We definitely didn't leave hungry! It was a tad on the pricey side for us, but the food was so worth it and the service was top notch! I would definitely go back again.
