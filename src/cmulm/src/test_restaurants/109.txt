Today I took my step-dad for a nice steak at the Weber Grill Restaurant. This eatery was very busy, but as I had made a reservation I did not worry. We both ordered the New York Strip done medium and it was cooked to perfection. It was nicely charred on the outside, but still pink and juicy in the middle. Our steaks were served with homemade roasted garlic mashed potatoes and they were just as good as the meat. Also every table gets a basket of rolls with butter and a carafe of water. We eat, so much we almost did not want any desert, but decided to take it to go. My step-dad ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake and I ordered the chocolate bunt cake. Both oversized and very tasty. Although this restaurant was a little pricey it is nice for a spurge.
