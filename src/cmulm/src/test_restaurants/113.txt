I visited Weber Grill back in July, but it was so good I had to write a review. This was a recommendation from friends as a 'Must-eat-here' for my first visit to Chicago. I have good friends! I couldn't decide which main course I wanted (everything looked so good!) so our waited suggested we order a Weber Starter Sample to get a taste of most all the dishes we had been eyeing. Every single bite was delicious! It didn't make the decision for the main course any easier but I finally settled on the Filet Mignon, and I am not exaggerating when I say I was in heaven! I was cheated out of paying (Again, I have very good friends) but the price was very good value for the service and quality of the food we got. It is a must-eat for all you meat-lovers out there!
