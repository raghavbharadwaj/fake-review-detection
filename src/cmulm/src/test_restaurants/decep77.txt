Shaws Crabhouse had an excellent atmosphere and was just a cozy place. The waiter was nice and prompt getting our orders. I ordered the spider roll and my girlfriend ordered the battered alaskan halibut tacos. The sushi was very good and flavorful and my girlfriend really liked the fish tacos, they were savory and just plain good. I would recommend a seafood lover here anytime.
