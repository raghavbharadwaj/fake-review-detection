After hearing from a few locals and the concierge of our hotel about how wonderful this restaurant is, we had to give it a try and WAO!! Is the only thing that can describe it! Most dishes are meant to be shared so please come very hungry because you don't want to stop. We had the Whipped Feta with Cucumbers to start along with the Roasted Bone Marrow with herbs... amazing! Who would have thought bone marrow could be so good. Then my husband ordered the Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes... It melts in your mouth! I ordered the Prosciutto Crusted Cobia with Clams & Sea Beans and I don't think I have ever had better fish than that. Of course, after all this deliciousness... there was no room for dessert! Bummer. Definitely, coming back and highly recommended! Do not leave Chicago without going to this place. Now, be ready because they do not accept reservations and the wait time is usually over an hour.... But you'll be glad you waited!
