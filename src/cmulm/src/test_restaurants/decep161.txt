The atmosphere was really wonderful and I really appreciate how nice the servers were. They knew all the different types of beer and what each one tasted like. They were very helpful in recommending what to order. I like how the menu changes and it is not the same thing every time. I would be more than happy to recommend this restaurant to another friend. Once again, thanks for the spectacular service and food. Needless to say the beer was fantastic.
