Great sound at an affordable price!   The clarity of these headphones, especially in the treble, is really good.  They also fit very comfortably (I tried them for about four hours and had no trouble) and do a good job of blocking ambient noise when you have the switch in the right place. I looked at several other brands/models, but the MDR-777 is the one I went for, and I'm really glad that I did.
