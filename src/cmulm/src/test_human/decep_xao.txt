Great value for the given price tag. Its compact. Has excellent noise cancellation features. The sound quality after noise cancellation is amazing. It so happened that I was watching a movie at my room and my mom called me for dinner and i coulden't even hear her yelling..!!! 
Excellent product in 200$ price range. I am quite adventurous I go off road cycling quite often and this bike has given outstanding performance Duel suspension system is amazing smooth-ens your ride without having any back pain. Transmission is very smooth the gear shifting mechanism is good. Brakes are also pretty amazing. Seat quality is pretty good its soft and comfortable for long ride.
