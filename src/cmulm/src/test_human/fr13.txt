I absolutely fell in love with this trilogy, It is an amazing love story and I am probably going to wear the books out from reading them over and over again. The story just came to life on the pages and made you feel like you were a part of it !!! I cried, I laughed, I could actually feel all the emotions that the story was filled with. My focus was not on the sexual part of the book as much as the amazing journey they took and all the difficulties they encountered along the way and yet were able to over come.
