So far this toaster has performed very well. In fact, it's been the best toaster I've come across. Very easy to use; toasts extremely well. The leverless feature is very good and beats other toasters with a lever since the lever will sometimes fall apart after using them awhile...like a recent KitchenAid toaster I purchased and had to return b/c of this problem. Very frustrating! I love this toaster and hope it's a keeper! Also, I like the standard 3 year warranty of Cuisinart products.
