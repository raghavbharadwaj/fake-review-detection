My husband and I just had a great dinner at Topolobampo. This is not a taco and fajitas place, but a nice restaurant to have real Mexican food. We had one of the tasting menus, and the size, quality, presentation and variety of it was really good. The service is very good as well, Whitney was very helpful and attentive. We will definitely come back to this place.
