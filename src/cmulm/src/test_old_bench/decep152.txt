I recently ate at the Girl & The Goat restaurant. I was hoping to find something unique, great tasting, and a great atmosphere and I found this place to have all three qualities. I had an awesome portion of sauteed green beans and an appetizer. I had an awesome goat loin dish for my mian course that was cooked to perfection and I can't wait to have that again. The strawberry parfait to top it off did not disappoint. I plan to try the oysters next time, it looked as though the couple at the next table was enjoying them. Their menu has plenty of variety to offer. I highly recommend this place for a date night but it also works for a casual dinner. I will be back!
