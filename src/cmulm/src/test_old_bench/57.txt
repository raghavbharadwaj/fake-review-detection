Loved this restaurant!! The wine and food were fantastic. We stopped by on a very busy Saturday afternoon and managed to snag a couple of seats at the bar - super friendly bar staff - generous pours of great wine and a couple of truly delicious dishes later - we left very happy! So happy in fact that we made a point to go the next day when it wasn't so busy, but we still sat at the bar - where you can see the chef preparing your food right in front of you. Very generous portions of delicious, imaginative food - I could eat there every week and not get bored in a year.
