As a big fan of seafood, I've been dying to find a great but affordable seafood place in Chicago. Upon recommendation from a friend, I tried Shaw's Crab House -- and was definitely glad I did! The items on the menu are well within my budget... which means they should be well within anyone's budget! The quality of the service is excellent; my server was friendly and I didn't have to wait long at all. Factor that in with the quality of the food, and it goes without saying that I've been won over! I implore anyone looking for some excellent seafood without wanting to break the bank to check out Shaw's -- hopefully you'll be as surprised as I was.
