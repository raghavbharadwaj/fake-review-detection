My family of 4 visited Ditka's restaurant in Chicago for lunch for the first time, and we weren't disappointed. Although the establishment was busy, our wait for a table was minimal. Service was very prompt, which is a must when dining with kids! My husband and I found the lunch menu to be extensive and we were happy with the selection of beer. The salads were fresh and our burgers were prepared to our liking. Even our picky kids liked their food. And most importantly, when the bill came, we found our total to be reasonable, given the amount of food and drinks that we ordered. This is a great stop for tourists, and the next time we are in Chicago, we will be sure to stop in again!
