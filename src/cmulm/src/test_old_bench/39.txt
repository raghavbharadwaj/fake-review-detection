Had Da Chop. Hands down the best pork chop I ever had. The cherry sauce and apple chutney really set it off. Filet mignon was also very good. Banana creme pie ended a great meal. The only down side was the noise level. We were put an an alcove area with some other loud groups and it held the sound in. It was hard for my wife and I to carry a conversation. To the benefit of the restaurant. One of the groups did apologize for being loud. The other areas in the restaurant may not have this 'acoustic issue'
