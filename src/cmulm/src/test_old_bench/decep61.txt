I decided to treat myself to something special. I'd heard my friends talk about and decided to grab the wife and finally check out The Purple Pig. We arrived at 6pm, trying to beat the dinner rush. Luckily there was plenty of room and we did not have to wait. Antonio was our server for the evening. His uniform was clean and well fitted. We shared the kale and romaine caesar salad to start. It was good and the anchovy did not overpower the rest of the dish. However my wife was not the biggest fan of the quail egg. For entree I had the olive-oil poached tuna and it was amazing. My wife had the ham and mushroom panini but only ate half. I of course finished it right up for her! Neither of us had wine(had to work in the morning) so I can't really comment there, though the wine list did look rather extensive. We paid for our dinner and as we were leaving Antonio said good night and invited us back in again. The place was clean, the staff friendly, and most importantly the food was good. We just might take Antonio up on that invitation.
