We are charcoal grillers on Weber grils at home, and were truly excited to see this restaurant. We have tried burgers and mix Barbecue (ribs and briskets). The plate came with wrong choices. They gladly and rapidly came with the missing ribs and left us the wrong ordered chicken. It was very nice of them and gave us the chance to taste even more. Everything was truly excellent and the price was all right for what we've had. We were sitting at the bar and it was nice to see the cooks working on the huge, custom Weber grils.
