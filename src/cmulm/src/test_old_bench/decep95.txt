My boyfriend and I stopped by Frontera Grill the other night for dinner and were really pleased - it was overall a delicious experience and very reasonably priced. I started off with the blood orange margarita - incredible! Definitely a unqiue item, and I loved the flavor. My boyfriend had a rum and ginger cocktail which he said was very good. They also had the typical Mexican beers and a small selection of craft beers, which I will definitely be sampling next time. Since we are both fish lovers, we started out with the tropical tuna cocktail, which was sashimi grade tuna with an amazing tomatillo-based sauce and tangy salsa. And for the meal, we both got taquitos, which also came with a tomatillo-based sauce and guacamole. They were excellent (though I have loved every taquito I have ever eaten!) and came in a satisfyingly large portion. Best of all, the price was reasonable. The taquito entree is less than $10, so even though we had a great meal it did not hurt our wallets much. We had a great time here and really enjoyed our food, so I definitely will be back, and recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes high-quality Mexican food!
