Are you looking for a fun and tasteful new restaurant to try out? Girl & the Goat is the place to explore with your taste buds. The food is unique (in a good way) because they offer food variations that you normally don't see in a restaurant. My favorite combination would have to be Grilled Baby Octopus with a nice cold brew. Along with the great food quality comes with great customer service. Girl & the Goat as some of the nicest waitstaff a restaurant could ask for. They are not just trying to sell you food, but trying to make your experience at the restaurant that much better. If I had to rate this place, I would give it a 10 out of 10. This is a most place stop!
