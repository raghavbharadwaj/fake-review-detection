This was a wonderful restuarant we stumbled across. We came without a reservation, but since they have a nice bar area, we didn't mind waiting. The wait wasn't long and we got the best outdoor table. We ordered pizzas, and from the first bite, I fell in love -- it was WONDERFUL! The service was attentive but not intrusive. And guests would feel equally comfortable dressed up or casual. There are few places that I will remember so fondly from our Chicago weekend as this great little restaurant. We will be back!
