We really enjoyed the dining experience at Gibsons. The food was very good and large servings. The staff was attentive. I was surprised when I got the bill that it was only around 30 per person. As usual there were several local celebs (sports,politicians, etc). The deserts were INSANE. I mean holy cow the size of their cakes were just incredible.
