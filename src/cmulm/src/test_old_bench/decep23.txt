For Fathers day I received a gift card to Ditka's, a restaurant owned by former Chicago Bears Head Coach Mike Ditka. I was excited to try it out and went last night. I made a reservation for the Chicago location through the website (this was very easy to do). When we got there I immediately took notice of the decor, which was very visually appealing to me. Service was quick to take our orders. I got the Alaskan Halibut, my wife the Lake Perch. Both arrived to our table quickly. The portions were large and I had to get a too go bag! We were so full we decided to skip dessert. The prices were fair. Overall I would rate the place an 8/10 and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
