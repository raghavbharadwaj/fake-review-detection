I used to go to Shaw's Crab House/Blue Crab Lounge every Friday after work. Then my twin sister became the pastry chef at Shaw's and I would drop her off every morning after swim practice and have the breakfast of champions...a slice of Shaw's Key Lime pie (mouth watering) and a cup of coffee! Unfortunately, I no longer live in Chicago, but when I visit the city, Shaw's is a must!
