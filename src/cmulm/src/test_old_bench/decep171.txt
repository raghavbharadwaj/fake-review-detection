When I first walked into Quartino I was greatly surprised (in a good way!). I have been to many restaurants in the area and in Chicago in general but the atmosphere and presentation here jumped out at me. Something about it was so simplistic and comforting, I felt like a regular the first time I walked in. It made me want to return without having even tried the food! I was greeted by a host when I came in and was sat down at my table. The service was good. He was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable, however the place was very busy so he was running around to serve his many tables (not his fault). I ended up deciding on the Margherita pizza. The ingredients tasted very very fresh. I'm not much of a pizza person myself, but I tried it at the recommendation of the next table over and was very glad I did. I boxed up the 2nd half of the pizza for dinner, I wanted to have room in my stomach to try at least one more thing. I went with the "Chilled Zucchini - Grilled with sun dried tomatos." accompanied by the wine of the month, a 2011 Rosado from Spain. I probably should have asked for help pairing the wine plates with an appropriate wine, the server gave me some great recommendations that I didn't take him up on. It was still very very tasty, and worked decently, but next time I'll be sure to take the servers advice. They are there for a reason! Overall my experience at Quartino was excellent! The food, service, and atmosphere all came together nicely for a very holistic experience. I would recommend this place to others, however I would say it is best with 2-4 people. I can't wait to take my out of town friends here. Four and a half out of five.
