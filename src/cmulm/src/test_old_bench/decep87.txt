I went to Fonter with my wife for lunch. The atmosphere and service were both amazing. We weren't quite sure what to expect beforehand, but, we were very happy once we went there. It's a nice cozy place, where you can sit back and enjoy a meal without being distracted by too many people. We started out with the fresh corn tamales, and let me tell you, they were amazing. We then went on to have the Tacos Al Carbon with steak. It was cooked perfectly and was honestly, probably the best steak taco I've ever had. If you do go, make sure you check out the homemade ice cream. Ben and jerry's has nothing on these guys. It goes perfectly with the chocolate pecan pie as well! If you are in the neighborhood, definitely check them out, we'll be back for sure!
