When we entered the restaurant we were a little overwhelmed by the noise: There are lots of big tables for 6 or more people and the sound volume was incredible! We both chose to go for a Pizza each. The waiter advised us to share one because of the size (about 12in). In the end one Pizza wasn't enough so in addition we ordered meatballs and tomato-soup. The pizza was european-style, the soup was okay, the meatballs were delicious.
