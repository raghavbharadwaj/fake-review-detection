My husband and I treated ourselves to an intimate dinner date at the Signature Room to celebrate our wedding anniversary. What a treat it was. I had the Lamb, and my husband the Veal. We also added a side of vegetables. The food was delicious; fresh wonderfully flavored, cooked to perfection and served with a creative flair. The portions left us satiated, so much so we had to force ourselves to share a dessert. The staff helped us pair our meal with complimenting wines. We felt like royalty sitting atop the John Hancock Center looking over the lights of the city. I don't hesitate to recommend The Signature Room for any special occasion and look forward to our next excuse to dine there. We noted on the menu that the restaurant supports a different charity each month!
