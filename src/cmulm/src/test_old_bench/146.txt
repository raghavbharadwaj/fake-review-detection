Great spot. Energetic space, interesting cocktails, good selection & quality of wines by the glass, and small plates, which allow diners to sample many dishes. Lastly, despite the restaurant's name, extensive vegetarian & vegan options. Hard to get reservations, but they do accept walk ins when they open. Highly recommended!
