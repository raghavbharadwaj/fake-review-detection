I was advised, like many others, that going to the Signature Lounge instead of paying to go the Observatory is better value for money. It is. You get to relax in a bar that has outstanding views of the city and whilst the drinks are not the cheapest, they certainly are not too extortionate and you can enjoy the view with one or two shandies. Always nice after a hard days sightseeing
