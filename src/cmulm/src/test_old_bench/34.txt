We travel to Chicago a couple of times a year and one of our favorite places is Ditka's. We enjoy the service and every meal is great. An excellent wine list as well. Dining can be quiet in the dining room or eclectic in the bar area. Went in for St. Paddy's Day and though we went just before closing, we got the last two servings of corned beef and cabbage. A perfect ending to an Irish Day.
