recently I ate at a restaurant called Quartino an Italian restaurant. Upon arrival I noticed the outside was very well taken care of, the ground were well maintained and there was no litter on the ground. As I walked in the first thing I noticed was the smell of cleanliness and good food. the hostess greeted me promptly even though it was busy and told me the wait time would be about 20-30 minutes but told me could have a seat at the bar where I was offered o complimentary glass of wine. The wait time was accurate as I was seated 25 minutes later. The server greeted me right away and took my drink order. He returned with in 10 minutes with my drink, and a basket of fresh bread and butter. Upon his return he started telling me about the specials they were offering that night. I placed my order and was served with in 15 minutes. All in all I had a very wonderful experience at Quartino. The service was outstanding, the staff was efficient and courteous, the restrooms were well stocked and clean. I will be returning there in the future and will be telling my friends and family that I highly recommend this fine dining experience.
