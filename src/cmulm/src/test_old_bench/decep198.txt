As a new customer visiting "The Signature Room at the 95th" I must say that I am not only thrilled with the experience, but also extremely happy with the high level of service I received. The floor to ceiling windows that allowed us to view the Chicago skyline was absolutely gorgeous, I feel lucky to have had this experience! The amount of variety on the menu is exquisite, and the pricing was not as high as I expected! I was shocked! A semi-reasonably priced, delicious, clean, well-mannered restaurant! I have been raving to all of my friends and family about this restaurant, and we are planning a family trip to visit not only Chicago, but this restaurant as well! I highly recommend this restaurant, although if you're afraid of heights I would ask for a table further away from the windows! It could be intimidating to those with issues with height!
