My wife and I came upon this place while wandering through Chicago on foot. What a great find!! We absolutely loved the barbequed brisket and chicken. I clumsily spilled my wine just after it was served and the staff immediately cleaned it up and brought me a new one at no charge. Nice people and great barbeque at very reasonable prices.
