Don't let the name fool you, the Weber Grill Restaurant is more than just hamburgers and hot dogs and as I found out this last weekend, one of the best steak houses around. My dining experience began this last Saturday around 6:00 pm and upon arriving at the Weber Grill I immediately assumed that I would be waiting for a while before being seated due to the fact that there almost wasn't an empty parking spot in the whole lot. To my pleasant surprise however I only had to wait about five minutes before being seated. I reviewed the menu and decided to splurge and ordered the Prime NY strip, medium well. The steak, which arrived in less than 15 minutes, was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The Parmesan Truffle Mashed Potatoes and grilled asparagus were a perfect pairing with the steak as well as the house made steak sauce. Equally as pleasurable as the meal was the service as well as the atmosphere. Overall my dining experience was extremely pleasurable and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this fine dining experience giving it a 5 out of 5 stars. Thank you Weber grill,
