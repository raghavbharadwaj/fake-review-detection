Had a wonderful 7oz filet with perfectly cooked broccoli and i was trying to stay a bit with the diet, but ended up having to have the bernaise sauce which was delicious. Also, it came with a good sized salad. Also, gave into the delicious fresh bread and butter. Gave up the idea of dieting..but well worth it. Couple of blocks from several downtown hotels.
