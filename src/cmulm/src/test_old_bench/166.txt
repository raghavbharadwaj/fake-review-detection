We showed up at 8:30 on a Friday night in December and there was a 2 hour wait for a table, so we sat at a table in the bar (lucky to have grabbed one!). We had a very good waitress who recommended wine, entrees, and dessert. She was right on the money each time, too! Both of our pastas were delicious. The house salad was crisp and had the right amount of ingredients, along with the fresh, light balsamic dressing. The chocolate fondue was fun and different! Give this place a try, as long as you can put up with the noise level. I'm in my 50's and was one of the oldest people there. Really, it's fun!
