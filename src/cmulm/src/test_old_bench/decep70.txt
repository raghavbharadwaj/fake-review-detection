Shaw's Crab House is a new restaurant in Chicago that I would highly recommend to satisfy your next craving for a great seafood dinner. Last Friday night, I spotted the website at www.shawscrabhouse.com online, and was impressed with their tempting menu, the virtual tour, and the ease of making an online reservation. We arrived at Shaw's at 7:00 for dinner. The restaurant was crowded, but our reservation got us seated by a window within 5 minutes. The atmosphere is casual, and decorated in a pleasant decor with lots of beautiful wood and interesting marine art. The waiter arrived quickly and was friendly and knowledgeable. We all ordered the Alaskan Red Crab dinner, and our mouths watered as we enjoyed the succulent flavors. The entire meal was fresh, eye appealing and delicious. The cost was fair and well deserved. We all agreed that we would return to Shaw's Crab House again very soon.
