I recently went to Mike Ditka's - Chicago for dinner with friends, it was my first trip to the restaurant. Overall I enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the food was delicious and the waitstaff was courteous and friendly. I would recommend Mike Ditka's - Chicago to a friend. The atmosphere immediately caught my attention as I arrived. I am an avid sports fan, I found the restaurant's ambiance to be very exciting. There was a lot of very interesting pictures, posters and sports memorabilia decorating the restaurant. It's really any Chicago sports lover's dream! I was really impressed with the food. I had a Prime Filet Mignon with a loaded twice baked potato. The chef did a great job of cooking my steak exactly how I ordered it, medium rare. My meal was a little bit costly but the food itself was outstanding. Our waitress did a great job of getting my food out to me quickly so it did not end up sitting under a heat lamp for a long time drying out. If you are a sports fan and you enjoy steak, Mike Ditka's - Chicago is definitely a restaurant you will want to visit. I will be back to try some of the other delicious sounding items on the menu like the burgers, ribs and seafood. Despite the price, I was completely satisfied with my meal, it was worth every penny. I am looking forward to my next visit to Mike Ditka's - Chicago.
