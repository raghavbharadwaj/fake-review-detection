I've been to Quartino's several times for several different occasions for both business and leisure. Quartino's staff always knows how to tend to my needs perfectly--they are always very helpful and very knowledgeable about the daily specials and menu items. I loved the vintage decor throughout the restaurant and their great selection of wines. The thing I love most about this place is the option of choosing the shared menu where two people can eat a three meal course for a very reasonable price. They have valet parking which is always a plus and serve both individuals and large groups. You can book reservations directly on their website which is great because you can book on the go. I would definitely recommend the roasted calamari or salmon and my favorite pasta is the gnocchi. Chef Cotello is one amazing chef and his restaurant is by far one of the best in Chicago.
