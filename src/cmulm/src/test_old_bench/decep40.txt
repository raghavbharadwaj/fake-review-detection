I visited Mike Ditka's Chicago location the other night and was highly impressed with the restaurant. This location, in the Tremont hotel, has a great atmosphere and a very courteous staff. I went with a small group for dinner and we decided to try out several items on the menu to share. The Seafood Tower and Coach's Pot Roast Nachos were a big hit with our group. For my meal I got the Kobe Burger which was cooked as requested and very juicy. The side of fries I got was also good, though I was pretty full from all the rest of the food and didn't finish them. I would definitely visit Mike Ditka's again for the ambiance and the delicious food.
