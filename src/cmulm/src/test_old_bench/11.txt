We had a great meal here! The stone crab and Alaskan King crab appetizers were awesome! Then the steaks came and they were just as awesome! Cooked perfectly. The sides were big enough to share as were the salads. The waiter was efficient and had a great knowledge of the menu. Overall it was a great meal and we will definitely return when back in Chicago.
