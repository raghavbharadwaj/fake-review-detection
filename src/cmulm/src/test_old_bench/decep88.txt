I was pleasantly surprised to find such a fantastic restaurant in Chicago (okay, wasn't suprised, but was suprised on the quality due to the low cost!) ! My friend and I were working here for three weeks and stopped by on a rare night that we got off early. I had the lobster bisque, which was really incredible, and the arugula salad, which was good but not too heavy on the arugula (diluted with spinach, which was acceptable to me) and also a little too sweet. Overall it was tasty and filling however, for only $12. The wine was good and the service was excellent. I wish the beer list was more extensive. My friend got the Seafood Newburg and really loved it- I think I would probably get an entree instead of a salad next time despite the steep price increase. A little expensive but expected in the city.
