My husband and I celebrated our anniversary with dinner at Gibson's in Oak Brook. Our expectations were high and were exceeded. The services was impeccable. Our server was thorough and even gave honest opinions when asked. She did not try to sell the most expensive item on the menu. The food came out quick and hot. My husband's steak was done perfectly while my tilapia was flaky and delicious. I would recommend the seared steak appetizer, unbelievably delicious! Only minor concern was how crowded and loud it was. But after awhile, it added to the charm of Gibson's. Would recommend to anyone!
