For a moment I thought I was in Rome, it was Monday and I was visiting Chicago for Business. At lunchtime my Business partner recommended the Quartino. I could not think of a better choice. The wine was half price on Mondays, so we considered that we were in the right place at the right time. The Quartino presented the best of Italian traditional mouth-watering fare. It was difficult to choose from the many option because everything smelled so good. I had that sense of nostalgia as I glanced at the menu. The Artisanal Alumi, Neopolitan thin-crust pizza, house made Pizza brought back special memories of my 3-day trip to Rome. The first time I had eaten Artisanal Alumi was in Rome. Chef Colletta did an excellent job! Fine dining, excellent wine and authentic Italian atmosphere is the feeling you get when you walk in. As you walk in you are greeted by the effervescent personality, Chef John Colletta. He is famous for transporting the culture of Rome to the bustling city of Chicago. We needed to talk business so we were able to enjoy the private dining that they offered. The Waitress said 'Bon Apetiti' and we sat down to an enjoyable Business 3 course lunch special for $25. Yum! What a treat
