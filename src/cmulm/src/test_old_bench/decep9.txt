My boyfriend and I were on vacation in Chicago and, as always, were looking for a great restaurant to try out. After reading several reviews we decided to try out Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. This worked very well for us because my boyfriend loves seafood and he doesn't get it often enough because I'm much more interested in steak. It's difficult to find a place that does both equally well but Joe's does it! Everything about our experience was amazing, starting when we walked into the restaurant. I loved the dark wood of the ceilings and the beautiful mahogany tables. The lighting was perfect to create a romantic dining experience for the two of us. After being seated we were greeted by a charming, friendly waiter dressed impeccably in black tie. He was extremely helpful in offering suggestions and very observant and prompt in making sure we had everything we needed. I ordered the bone in filet and my boyfriend ordered stone crab. The food was excellent; very flavorful and cooked perfectly. We both agreed that we would definitely eat at Joe's again the next time we visit Chicago.
