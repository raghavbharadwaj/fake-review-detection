A great fulfilling meal from Joe's! My friend and I visited Joe's after hearing much praise about the restaurant. Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted upon and it did not take long for us to be seated and waited on. We started with calamari (a must-have!) and oysters. The seasoning on the calamari was just right and the sauce was a great complement. Then we ordered the crabs, which far exceeded my expectations. They were a good portion and were fresh and broiled to perfection. And of course, I can't forget dessert! I have such a sweet tooth, so I know a good dessert when I come across one, and I must say, their blueberry pie was absolutely delicious. It was the perfect way to end the perfect meal. Compliments to Joe's for their excellent food and service! Definitely will be recommending to others and returning!
