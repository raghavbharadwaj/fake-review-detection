Shaw's is definitely a neat place to grab a bite. I went right when they opened at 11:30 for lunch, and it was already wicked packed. Being from Boston I'm a huge fan of lobster rolls, and I really wanted to see if their rolls were good enough to stand up to MA's delights. Good news! The rolls were stuffed full of lobster (no skimping here) and had just the right amount of mayo to satisfy my craving. Fries were pretty good, and the service was lightning fast even though it was packed. I was only in the area for a conference, but if I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely stop by! Oh, and don't forget to try the pecan pie--totally worth it!
