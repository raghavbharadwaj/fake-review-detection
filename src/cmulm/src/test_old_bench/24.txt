The food is consistently good. My friend had a burger with the chopped salad for lunch and I had the lake perch with a chopped salad. The salad is, I think, the best in town. The burgers are always done to perfection and the lake perch was very lightly breaded and fried, absolutely delicious. We ate in the bar, it is kind of noisy, but a fun atmosphere. For those who want white table cloths, the dining room would be a better choice.
