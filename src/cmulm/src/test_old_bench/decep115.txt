So we went to Weber Grill Restaurant for lunch. I was entertaining some clients and thought I would try this place since I heard they had great lunch specials. It was a gamble, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had made a reservation for 4 and upon arrival, we only had to wait a few seconds before being escorted to our table. The hosts were very friendly and let us know our waiter would be right with us. Usually, at a busy lunch restaurant, one can only hope to be helped immediately, but they seemed to have plenty of staff to go around and we were helped right away. Joe was our waiter and you can tell he really cares about his customers having a great lunchtime experience in a timely fashion. I ordered the grilled vegetable panini off their $10 lunch special. It arrived nice and hot and the portion was quite sizable. My clients were also happy with their orders and we were greeted by the waiter at various times during our meal to make sure our drinks were refilled. We made it out in a reasonable amount of time given the volume of people in the restaurant, so I would definitely come back for a lunch meeting if Weber's keeps up this level of service. A+!!
