From the location (practically epicenter to the viagra triangle) to the menu to the staff you will not be disappointed. The oysters were excellent and fresh. I have had the Filet Mignon, NY Strip, brazilian lobster tail and quite a few other selections off the menu. All are excellent, especially the 3lb tail! Excellent wine list to mtach. Must save room for the desert! The desert tray is always the same, but what is on it is quite unique and specialized. Worth every penny.
