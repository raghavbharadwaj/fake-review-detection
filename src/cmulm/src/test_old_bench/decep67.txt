My family and I heard some amazing things about Shaw's, so we decided to book a reservation and go out for a nice dinner together. We decided to go on a Saturday for dinner, and when we arrived the restaurant was bustling, but not chaotic. The hostess greeted us right away, and when we told her we had reservations we were immediately taken to our table that was already set up for us. The server greeted us right away and we placed an order for their Tuna Anaheim Tempura (highly recommended!) and wine. After a bit, we placed our orders for the main course, and it arrived promptly and hot and was absolutely delicious. Throughout the experience the wait staff were attentive, but not pushy, and the restaurant is beautiful and clean inside. I had a great experience, and highly recommend it!
