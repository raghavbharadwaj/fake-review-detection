We were in Chicag visiting our son at Uof Chicago. We asked him what he wanted for dinner and he said "Steak!" We were staying in the Tremont and thought we might try Ditka's. It was very good. The place was packed. We made a 7:00 reservation and got there about 6:30 and they couldn't seat us until a bit after 7:00. There was a convention in town and the bars (Ditka's has 2) were packed. But, when we got seated, our waiter was fantastic. The food was very well prepared. Steaks were perfect. Portions were huge. It is pricey, but what good steak place isn't?
