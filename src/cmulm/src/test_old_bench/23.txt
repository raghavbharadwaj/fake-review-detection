This place is great, the only restaurant I have been to that has coat check and to-go orders. It's atmosphere is classy meets athletics. Cigars, sports memrabelia and excellent food. The servers are very attentive although the place has been packed every time we have been. Try the pot roast nachos as an appetizer. They are a perfect combination of savory meat and spice. The pork chop is the star of the menu, big and bold. Ditka's cannot be missed if you are in Chicago.
