A relaxed atmosphere just blocks from Magnificent Mile. Great signage outside (huge red grills hanging off the building). Great decor inside (sort of arts & crafts, nice wood and natural stone). But on to the food: Got the BBQ Sampler... the grilled chicken literally fell off the bone it was so tender... grilled sausage... pork... AND ribs! Seriously, what more could you want. The berry dessert was delicious. Staff was attentive. Sure, it's kind of kitchy with the grills all abound... but great food!
