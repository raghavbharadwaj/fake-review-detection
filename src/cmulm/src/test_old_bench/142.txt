With all of the hype associated w/a tough-to-get reservation, sometimes you're wary by the time you get to go. It was my birthday so I hoped for the best. First, I appreciated the lack of pretension. At 5:30 on a Friday night, the restaurant was packed and everyone seemed happy to be there. Our server was quirky & charming. Also enjoyed chatting w/charming GM Tony. We shared 6 small plates - all really good. Favorites: goat empanadas, shoshito peppers, grilled octopus w/roasted pistachios. Very good wine too. 100% worth the hype.
