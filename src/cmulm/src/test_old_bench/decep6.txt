My Wife and I just got home from the most romantic and great tasting dinner I have had in many years. We went to Joe's Seafood. The atmosphere there was out of this world and the service was top notch. We were greeted and seated really quickly. When I made the reservation, It was quick and easy. They took our drink order immediately and we received our Sweat tea's with 5 mins. We then Ordered our food and got it within 15 minutes. We both ordered the Fathers Day special. The taste was out of this world and we had leftovers to take home. The server always seemed concerned with how we were doing and our drinks were always full. This place has great service, Great food and I love the atmosphere.
