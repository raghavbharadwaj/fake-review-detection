Excellent dining, we enjoyed a small family gathering at Quartino on a busy Saturday afternoon during Chicago holiday shopping. Our server was wonderful and brought just what we needed for our 4 yr old grandchild...a half order of linguine marinara with one of Quartino's favorite, a veal meatball...if you have never had a veal meatball you are definitely in for a treat. All the grandparents shared two pizzas, margarita and mushroom. Quartino uses fresh portabello mushrooms...delicious...we also ordered a veal dish and a risotto both were great choices. I would recommend Quartino for great food and staff...valet parking is also a plus.
