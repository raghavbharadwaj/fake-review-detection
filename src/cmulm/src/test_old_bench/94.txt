Okay, so going into this dining experience the bar was already ridiculously high. James Beard Awards, tv shows, cookbooks, etc... Well let me tell you, there is a reason for the hype. This dinner blew me away. The homemade guacamole was the best we'd ever had. The Jicama/Cucumber/Pineapple salad was incredible. My wife ordered a roasted chicken dish with beet sauce while I had grilled shrimp with crispy kale, green herbed rice, and a pepper medley. For dessert we ordered the raspberry-apple turnover with sour cream ice cream, topped with pink peppercorns. The entire meal was simply outstanding.
