Small Plates of yummy food. We ordered 4 "small plates" not really small , of Green beans, Roasted Beets, Scallops and of course Goat, all beautifully cooked in interesting sauces. Excellent wait staff, who do not push you to order too much. Extremely busy on Saturday night but they had casual seating round the bar that we sat down in and were served in very quickly
