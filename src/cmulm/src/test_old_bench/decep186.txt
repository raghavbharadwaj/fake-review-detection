I visited the Signature Room this evening to enjoy a 10th anniversary dinner with my husband. I couldn't ask for a better view- the restaurant overlooks the city streets of Chicago. We were seated especially close to the gigantic, encompassing windows. I dined on the Grilled Tofu. I was especially pleased to see so many readily-made-vegan options. Many restaurants require you to call in advance if you have such strict dietary restrictions, but luckily (since I did not mention when calling), Signature Room's menu featured many vegetarian options, and a few vegan ones. The food was magnificent- beautiful, delicious, flavorful. I was a little reluctant to eat it, but only because I wanted to have my cake and eat it too! I would recommend this place for any special occasion.
