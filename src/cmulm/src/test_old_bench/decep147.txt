What can I say about Girl and the Goat? Every Chicagoian wants to get in here and eat at some point. I finally got my chance during my anniversary dinner, where my husband make reservations without me catching on! The restaurant was so warm and inviting and I even caught a glimpse of the chefs working as we were seated. The decor was amazing, and the selection of food was phemonimal. I order the crispy pork belly, and the hubby had some confited goat belly. The presentation was out of this world and so was the taste. I was in heaven. We left full, but not feeling fat. The food was rich without feeling like there was real weight to it. Such a great experience, I can't wait to go back!
