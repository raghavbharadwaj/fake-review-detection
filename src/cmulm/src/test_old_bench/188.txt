While you can bet on close to a $100 per person...this is a great place worth the price for a special occasion. While I would only give the food a 7-8 on a 10 scale considering the price. The view is a 12 on that scale and makes up for it. I would suggest going right at sundown to enjoy the city lighting up - plus the east side of the restaurant provides the best views. I haven't seen it...but for the ladies, the view from the bathroom is supposed to be the best in Chicago from anywhere.
