I finally decided to try Quartino, a restaurant in downtown Chicago I had heard many good things about. I showed up at about 6pm on a Friday evening with a close friend, and after a short wait (it was busy!) was given a table on the outdoor patio. I was greeted by a waiter very quickly and we each ordered a glass of red wine off a pretty impressive wine list - I had a pinot and she had a cab. The menu is tapas style with MANY dishes to choose from and share with the table. We decided to order a couple small plates to share, and an entree each. We started with Duck Prosciutto and the Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare, which is a mixture of octopus, shrimp and clams cooked in a tomato sauce - it was a bit more expensive but so worth it! We wanted to try something new and this was an incredible dish. Cooked well and seasoned perfectly. For our main course I got the Veal Osso Buco and she ordered the ravioli. My osso bucco was perfectly cooked - it tasted like it had been cooking all day! It was served with an herb based condiment that pair perfectly with the rich veal. I was told the ravioli (which was hand made in house) was tender and full pork goodness. It also contained speck, which I have never had but tried, and was very bright and floral. In a strange way, it worked perfectly with the pork and tomato sauce. After dinner, we were too full to order dessert, but I will definitely be returning - possibly for a digestif and an Italian dessert I've never had before? Despite being very busy, the service was attentive and the food was served hot. I have already recommended this place to my friends and will be returning several times in the future!
