We celebrated 20th anniv. with another couple on the 18th of this month. It was just an excellent experience. The service was outstanding. We had at least 5 people who serviced our table. all were very cordial and fun. Even though the place was packed, they made us feel we were the only ones. The food is much above average. it was not cheap to eat there and might be bit pricey. (drinks especially) But it is worth it for the experience and the view.
