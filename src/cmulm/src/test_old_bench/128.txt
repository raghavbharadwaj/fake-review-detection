My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at Gibsons with our daughter last week. The atmosphere and service were outstanding. For a high end steakhouse I was a little disappointed with the food. It was high quality, tasty and cooked to order, but I didn't get that WOW factor that I was expecting from a place with the reputation that Gibsons has earned. Maybe my expectations were too high. Overall it was a great evening and I would celebrate another special event at Gibsons.
