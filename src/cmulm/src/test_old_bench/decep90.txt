Honestly speaking this is the best and most delicious food I have ever had in the longest time. After moving into this new neighborhood I didn't really know any good places to eat. During a friendly conversation, my neighbor suggested me this place and I am so glad I spoke to him. Honestly, the food is amazing; they make it fresh, itao>>s clean and service is just wonderful. Unlike most restaurants the silver wear is actually spotless clean! I was highly impressed by the service, cleanliness and the quality of the food. One of the best foods I have ever had. I would highly-highly recommend this to everyone. You actually get what you pay for. It's affordable, it's healthy and it's amazing. You will love it, I know I did.
