Went on a Thursday and enjoyed signature margarita along with the lamb mole - wow! It was pretty special in terms of flavor and I really enjoyed it. Don't know that I would call it Mexican. Rather Mexican inspired fine dining. It is loud and crowded and the service is crisp. The waiter suggested my order and I was not dissappointed!
