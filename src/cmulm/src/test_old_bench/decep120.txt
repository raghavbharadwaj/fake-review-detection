Weber Grill is one of the best places I have ever eaten! I'm a repeat customer they have kept on-board with their business for almost two months now! I actually came upon this restaurant through a co-worker outing after work to Smokey Joe's Bar, which was a very fun experience. But I had noticed that it was also a restaurant so one day I figured I would try it out and have loved it ever since. Yes the food is a little pricey. But the service, environment and the food is worth what you're paying! Favorite food would definitely be their steak. I love the NY strip so very flavorful and delicious! Definitely would recommend as a good bar or restaurant!
