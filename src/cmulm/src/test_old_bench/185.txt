Had NY Strip (huge) and roasted chicken (which was better than the much hyped chicken at Thomas Keller's Bouchon). Starter salads were very fresh and not over dressed. Excellent food - steak cooked perfectly, excellent service. However our food took forever to come out. Avoid KALE side dish - spicy and not cut into small pieces (i.e. giant pieces you have to chew through). Mashed potatoes and mushroom side dishes are good. Special simple candle dessert for anniversaries / birthdays etc - let host know if it's a special occasion when making reservation.
