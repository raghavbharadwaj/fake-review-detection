We arrived at lunchtime with no reservation. I initially suggested to my friend that we eat in the bar area so we would get a quicker service but I'm gald we waited 15mins to get into the restaurant. The restaurant had a lovely decor. Our waiter was efficient, friendly and very knowledgable about the food. The crab cake was the best I have ever tasted, I would go there again for that alone! The rest of our food (Mahi Mahi and the Seafood Platter) was fresh and nice. It was a bit pricey but if you want nice meal in a relaxed atmosphere it's well worth it.
