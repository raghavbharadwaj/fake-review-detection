Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse is a small restaurant in midtown Chicago with excellent food and a very comfortable and casual atmosphere. This being the first time I had eaten there, I decided to go all out. I ordered the New York Sirloin with a Double Baked Potato and House Salad. The food took a bit, but the wait was well worth it. My steak was cooked to perfection just as I had ordered it and everything tasted scrumptious. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I could not have asked for a better dining experience. I can't wait to visit again and try some more of their mouth-watering menu selections. I'll definitely be recommending Gibsons to all of my family and friends.
