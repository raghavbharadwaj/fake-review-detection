We sat outside since it was a lovely day. The food comes in smaller amounts and is meant to be shared. We tried some different meats, cheese, and salads. The nice thing about this type of restaurant is you control the amount of food you want because you don't order all the food at once. You start with a few items and if you are still hungry you can order a few more items. The service was quick.
