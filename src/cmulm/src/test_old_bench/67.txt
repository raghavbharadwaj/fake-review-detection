I went with a friend on a Sunday night and we had a ball! Lovely helpful staff, great menu (you can choose to sit in bar area or across the other side in the tonier restaurant). Fantastic band playing some wonderful jazz, and the seafood - scallops and mahi mahi - was wonderfully cooked and presented. This is just a great venue. Pity we have nothing similar in the UK!
