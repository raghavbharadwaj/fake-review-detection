I had been to Joe's out in Vegas once before I came to Chicago, and was very fond of it. The Joe's in Chicago is one of the best restaurants I have been to in years. They featured a full wine list which included some great Merlot. My fiance and I started off with the '2nd Mortgage' featuring Alaskan King Crab, Shrimp and Scallops which was incredible. The Rib-eye steak I got for dinner was cooked to perfection and was rubbed with the perfect about of spices and pepper. I'm not one to 'lick my plate clean', but it was hard to put down my fork. Joe's is highly recommended and, if you can, save room for dessert, the Key-Lime pie was fantastic.
