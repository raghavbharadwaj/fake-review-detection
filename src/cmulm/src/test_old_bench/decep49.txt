I had heard about The Purple Pig for a while and the chefs associated with it and wanted to try it out. Granted having the motto of "Cheese, Swine and Wine" didn't hurt! So I grabbed a friend and made plans. We decided to head over on Sunday afternoon to give it a test run. I had to start with the Pork Fried Almonds - how could anything fried with pork be bad. It wasn't. My friend loved the chorizo stuffed olives (the stuffing tasted great but I'm not an olive fan). I did swipe a taste of the deviled eggs and will definitely order them next time for myself. After some good conversation, I ordered the meatball sliders and my companion ordered the porchetta. It comes with salsa verde and she was really surprised at how much she liked the salsa. My meatball sliders were awesome on a taste scale. We both agreed that for some casual tastings, all the food impressed and we would definitely come back another time to try the fancier dishes.
