I ate at Frontera Grill & Topolobampo for the first time the other night. It was by far some of the best Mexican food I have eaten in a while. To start, the chips and salsa was excellent. The salsa was spicy, but not to spicy and the chips were warm. Then they brought out my tacos. The meat and beans were cooked to perfection. The veggies were juicy and flavorful. I was so full from my main coarse that I couldn't even fathom having dessert, but it looked delicious and I'll be sure to save room for next time. This was a great dining experience. The servers were very friendly and the food was brought out in a timely manner. The atmosphere was very authentic and appealing. This was a very family friendly restaurant. I highly recommend Frontera Grill & Topolobampo. 5/5 Stars!
