Weber Grill Restaurant has undoubtedly win me over! My wife and I needed a place to celebrate our anniversary, and after checking the menu online decided to try Weber Grill Restaurant. We were promptly welcomed and sited very quickly. Our waitress was very polite and efficient throughout our meal. In fact, the whole staff seems very well trained and eager to give us the best experience possible. Weber being popular for their grilling, I ordered the Prime NY Strip and my wife ordered the Grill Twin Lobster Tails. The food met my expectations and then some! The steak was cooked perfectly and had that amazing back-yard grill taste to it. The Lobster tails were delicious and you could taste the freshness; my picky wife found nothing to complain about! So needless to say I will be coming back! Weber Grill Restaurant, keep doing what you do so well, and thank you for an excellent experience!!
