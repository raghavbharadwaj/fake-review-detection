Mike Ditka's restaurant in Chicago is amazing! My husband and I do not go out together all that often due to conflicting schedules but we decided on this place because of the atmosphere it portrayed and we were incredibly impressed. It is a beautiful place that makes you feel comfortable as soon as you walk in. It is clean and the smells were mouth watering. The staff was personable and greeted us with smiles which is something many service industries are lacking these days. We were seated without too much of a wait. Our waiter came to take our drink orders after only a minute or two and the drinks were ready right away. We ordered the fresh calamari to start. I am a HUGE calamari fan and this was some of the best I have had. It was hot, fresh, crispy and to die for. I would go back for that alone! I also had the spinach salad which had bacon and eggs and a delicious dressing. It was excellent and fresh. We shared the seafood platter which was plenty of food for the both of us after our appetizers and it was all so fresh I was shocked. Normally when you get seafood out it is hit or miss. Either it is fresh and wonderful or it isn't and it can break the whole experience. But Mike's is a place that a highly recommend for their exceptional service as well as their superb cuisine. We will certainly be going back! Our waiter got a great tip!
