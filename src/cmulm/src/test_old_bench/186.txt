For $17.95 each we had a great steak & frites plus got a window view on the 95th floor! For $17 each we could have gone to the 96th floor observation deck and had the same view but without the food... Not a hard choice! Very friendly staff and the food was fantastic! The view.. perfect! We ate there for lunch and a beautiful sunny day. I would recommended reservations.
