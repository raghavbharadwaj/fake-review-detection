After the airlines stranded us at the airport for 10 hours we decided to rent a car for a quick trip into the city. Once we got to the miracle mile we spotted the Purple Pig. We decided to be adventurous and we were well rewarded. I have never seen most of the items on a menu and we took a leap of faith. After tasting the selections we were rewarded with some of the best food ever. The staff was helpful in recommendations and it made the delay in Chicago not that bad.
