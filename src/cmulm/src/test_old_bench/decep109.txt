When I go to a restaurant there are 3 things I, and generally every rational person, looks for: quality, cleanliness, and excellent customer service. And Weber Grill Restaurant really knocks it out of the park categories. On the occasion that I attended this establishment, accompanied by my wife, we were first greeted by a warm, friendly hostess. I believe her name was Stella, we were promptly seated. The restaurant was about 3/4 of the way full, and shortly after being seated we met our waiter Joseph, who was prompt and thorough the whole time and. While waiting for our food I could not help but notice how clean and well decorated the restaurant was. It definitely looked like it could be a 5 star restaurant. For lunch I ordered "The Smokey Joe" and my wife had the "Southwest Turkey Wrap". Being from the south I had low expectations for a restaurant serving Barbecue above the Bible Belt. But the food really exceeded my expectations, not necessarily the quality of a 9-hour slow smoked brisket back home, but it was definitely one of the best damn Barbecue sandwiches I have had. I will definitely be back to this gem in the future. 4.5/5.0 Stars.
