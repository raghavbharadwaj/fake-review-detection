During our recent 10 day get-away, we tried several places ie: Shula's, Bin 35, Frontera,Harry Carey's. The food & ambiance at Ditkas was very nice. Although high priced, we found the portions to be Ditka size. We throughly enjoyed the pork chops & spitzel?, the steaks & sorbet. Service was excellent.
