Went here not expecting too much from a BBQ place but WOW, it was awesome! Everything was tasty and delicious! Try the skirt steak or the salmon... I know, you wouldn't think of salmon at a BBQ plac, but it was the best salmon I've ever had! The dessert list looked less than enticing so we passed, but all the entress - oh, and the artichoke appetizer - were phenomenal!
