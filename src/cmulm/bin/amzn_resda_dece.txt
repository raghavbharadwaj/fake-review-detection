Even though digital cameras are all the rage these days -- and I myself have three of them! -- sometimes you do want to use a film camera, especially when you can't carry an AC adapter with you, or don't want to shell out lots of money for extra batteries, to power your digital camera. Also, ISO/ASA 100 film or slower still gives you the best clarity outside of the negative and professional realms.This Olympus camera is a great basic film camera -- and it's a terrific value at less than sixty bux. It has the following features that I consider essential on every camera:-- auto focus. Some very low-end cameras (but this is not a low-end camera!) only have focus free", which means there's no focus in the lens. Olympus' auto-focus and auto-exposure systems work very well.-- zoom. Of course, this being a film camera means the zoom is optical. It's only 2x, but if you want more zoom you'll have to pay for it. (The Pentax IQ 145M does provide 4x zoom for under 100 bux, but that camera is also bigger in size.)-- date imprint. I'm one of those anal types who must document every picture I take. Being able to print the date, while irksome to some people, is a must for me. With a digital camera the photo file has a digital stamp which Windows XP can read (date, time, camera used, size, resolution, image quality, etc.). With a film camera, "quartz date" comes closest to having some extra info on the picture.-- lens cover. Some cameras don't even come with this!This camera is also pretty compact and feels right in my hands. The buttons are laid out just right. I find the lens a bit slow in moving in and out but not detrimental to picture-taking in most situations. (I don't shoot sports.) Red-eye reduction works ok but I rarely use it. Flash range is good, but you have to remember that a built-in flash can never do a good job at doing soft lighting.Picture quality is good with this camera. Assuming you use brandname film like Kodak and Fuji, you'll get pleasing pictures. (If you use a generic brand you got for free at the street corner from a guy in a funny hat, you may be disappointed in the prints... with any camera.) This is really a basic consumer camera, so don't expect lots of fine controls as you can with SLR's.Some reviewers complain about reliability problems, but from my experience Olympus cameras are some of the most reliable on the market. I haven't had mine long enough to know for sure, but the body seems sturdy and should last a long time."
This ink is great, it can print out high yields. It is a best ink cartridge for me to replace the original canon cartridge. I highly recommend this product.
These speakers by Polk produce wonderful sound that I can't complain about in the slightest! I have had these for about four months now; and although I could have spent more on speakers the sound that comes out of these really couldn't be that much better. The setup was not particularly hard, either.Just as quite a few others have stated, the sound is impeccable. The bass comes through just as it should and the overall clarity of the sound is perfect.The only caveat I can think of is that these are somewhat tall floorstanding speakers. Actually, they stand at just under three feet! At first they looked a bit too tall compared to my relatively small receiver and turntable; but that became completely meaningless after I heard the sound coming out of them!I highly recommend these speakers by Polk. You can't go wrong!
IOMEGA ZIP 250 DiskThe IOMEGA ZIP 250 disk is a high-capacity removable storage disk that is about the size of a standard 3.5 floppy disk. It can be read and written by an internal IDE drive (only one per system) or an external drive connected to a USB port or a parallel port (slowest in access). The IomegaWare Software provides utility functions designed for the ZIP disk, such as formatting or copying a disk. You should never use the Operating System disk copy function. Use the EJECT utility to remove a disk from a drive; this is required in Windows NT or Windows 2000. Remove the disk before turning a computer off You should never insert a ZIP disk in the drive when the computer is on as this can cause damage. Normally, shutting down the computer causes the disk to eject. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole.The IomegaWare software tests for the presence of the ZIP drive. It should be used in Windows 2000 to format a ZIP disk in the FAT format. Removable disks can contain a lot of data when it can be partitioned into 250 MB segments. The data on a ZIP drive can be read and written by different versions of an Operating System (using the FAT format). Rewriting reuses space, it does not increase the used space. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat (sunshine). The 250 MB ZIP disks can be read and written by a 750 MB drive.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
This drive is pretty good. I've burned a heck a lot of CDs that I love to listen to. It doesn't just burn CDs, it also plays them too. I like this drive, and it's nice to have two CD drive as well. But don't get confused, it doesn't read software or games, just music.I've had it for 2 years and the burning process is failing more often. Sometimes I hear this click-click-click noises sometimes while burning CDs, but it's only been happening on two brands of CD-Rs (Sony and Imatation), but I personally use Memorex and Maxell and they burn and play just fine in the Buslink drive (usually). Anyway, I surely recommend this Buslink drive because it's lasted already more than two years (got it Decmember of 2002), and the burn is very fast with 52x speed and 24x speed for re-writes.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The EP Memory Mobile Storage 64MB Compact Flash CF Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
This 1GB player's list price is only 59.95. I can't believe Ace Digital charges almost twice as much. It's a good flash MP3 player that looks stylish and plays forever on one AA battery.
This makes a nice, clean print and is reasonably priced. I've been able to print in high yields, so I'm happy.

I bought the Simpletech 64 MB compact flash card and was instantly impressed with the added storage capabilities. It's inexpensive and definately worth the added functionality to use with digital cameras, PDA's and MP3 players!
I bought this CD player because I needed one. This was the cheapest high-quality brand I could find. It's a pretty good player. It has all of the functions most players have (play, plause, rew, ff, back track, forward track, repeat, 50-track programming, scan, and random play). Sound is okay but the bass boost is awful, it doesn't make much of a difference. The side buttons are easy to use which are ESP off/on, mode (to switch your play mode), digital volume, a headphone jack, and the open button. I find it somewhat odd that Philips placed the open button on the right. The hold button is on the back side. The AC adapter plug is on the top. The headphones had good sound but they were not durable; they broke in only a week. There is a battery indicator as well on the screen which seems pretty accurate to me. I don't like that whenever you turn the player off then back on the volume and bass boost settings are changed. The player shuts off when you open the lid, kinda useless but it may be helpful for some. The CD player feels very durable but it weighs a whole lot more than the similar priced Sony player (though I avoided it because the Amazon rating doesn't look too good). All in all, you should be fairly happy with your purchase.
I bought these batteries because the Sony Cybershot digital camera I have had a hard time accepting alkaline batteries. Come to find out, the digital camera is only compatable with NiMH batteries. I bought these rechargeable batteries and couldn't be happier. It takes a few hours for them to fully charge, but otherwise they're great. They don't run out all the time like alkaline batteries, and even if they do run out, you don't need to waste money buying another pack of AA batteries for $2. Now that doesn't sound like much, but after awhile, it adds up, and rechargeable batteries are cheaper. Also, they seem to last about 10x longer (in my perspective) than AA alkaline batteries do (though some rechargeable batteries aren't that powerful). And now, I can take pictures with my camera, and load them into my computer, or do whatever (some alkaline batteries were so weak that my camera wouldn't even take a picture)! Highly recommended; go get a pair!NOTE: The picture of the product is incorrect. It's actually 2500 mAh, which is a big bargain.
I bought this charger set for my friend as a bithday gift. She says this charger set is excellent for her to charger her battery anywhere, such as at home, traveling or on the road. It allows her catch up all greatful sight.

This is a very high quality cable. It has all the right materials, specifically high-performance polypropylene foam dielectric on the signal lines. The connectors are large and solidly molded.
When I first saw the DSC-U20 at the Sony Style showroom in midtown Manhattan, I was totally awed. This is definitely the smallest digital camera on the market today, and the styling is superb, making it one of the things you want to own the moment you see it on display.Under the beautiful skin is a capable digital camera, with 1632x1224 resolution (good for prints up to 6x4") and very good image quality. The small flash does limit its use in dark settings, and the lack of optical zoom sticks out as a disappointment, but considering the typical use for a camera like this -- quick snapshots, party memories, candid exposures -- the overall package is still excellent and the feature compromises understandable.(For the ultra-cool and compact digital camera with optical zoom -- 3X at that! -- I heartily recommend the Minolta Dimage X and Xi, also available on Amazon.com.)The camera's lens, rated at the 35mm equivalent of 33mm (which makes it a wide-angle), is well made, as is the case with all of Sony's cameras. The camera has center-weighted auto focus with macro capability, and also center-weighted auto exposure. Shutter speed is rated in the 1/30 - 1/2000 range, typical for consumer-class digital cameras. The LCD viewfinder measures 1", which is quite small but still usable to most people except those who need thick reading glasses. You get a few digital effects (black&white;, negative, solarize, soft snap, etc.) when you do feel the creative juice flowing. You can also take 160x112 MPEG-format video clips, but I find this feature pretty much uselessFor power the U20 uses two AAA NiMH rechargable batteries. You can buy these batteries for cheap at Radio Shack, for example, and the camera kit comes with a recharger, although you can buy fancier ones that charge in less time and condition the batteries as well (actual benefit: unknown). I've taken about 30 pictures, all with flash, so far, and the batteries are still good. I definitely prefer these batteries to LiIon since 1) NiMH AAA is cheap and sold everywhere, and 2) they hold more power than LiIon and also have more rechargable cycles (i.e., they can be recharged more times). I'll update the real-world battery life rating once I get a better picture of it.Weighing in at 4.5 ounces with batteries and sporting the "I'm just cool" styling of Sony, the U20 is a little digital camera you'll love and carry with you all the while."
HP Deskjet 3820 PrinterThe HP3820 inkjet printer is designed for the average user at home or office. It comes in a two_tone beige and grayish_blue case like other HP printers. It connects to a computer with either an IEEE 1284 parallel cable (Windows 95) or a USB cable (Windows 98, Me, 2000, XP). The inkjet cartridges are: #15 for black, #78 for tricolor. The U_shaped paper path is the same as in other HP printers. This minimizes desk space and provides a more compact printer than those that use an oblique paper path. You should connect the cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the computer or printer. The power supply is built into the printer and not separate like earlier products. It is not good practice to keep the printer powered on when not in use; heat is the enemy of electronics. HP has long been the leader in inkjet printing. It can also be used with Apple Macintosh computers, see the User's Guide for the Mac.Its advertising leaflet claims brilliant photo quality and proven performance" due to HP's specially developed ink and papers. HP has "proven performance and product technology " for its family of products. The software provides an on_screen low_ink indicator. You can cancel any print by pressing the top button, a handy feature to correct a mistake. Its size and fold_up paper tray make it a compact fit for your home or small office. HP advises against refilling its cartridges, as you will learn from experience. It can print up to 12 pages a minute in black and up to 10 pages a minute in color; your results may differ. The original CD_ROM software provides the printer drivers . If you bought this used you can download the drivers from HP for Windows 2000, XP, and Vista. You may find the software for Windows 95, 98, and Me on the Internet.The User's Guide tells about getting started. The Print Cartridge Status light will blink when a print cartridge is low on ink, improperly installed, or malfunctioning (or wrong cartridge) top cover is open, or other problems. Open the top cover for details. From the front the five indicators run left to right for: color cartridge problem, black cartridge problem, color ink low, black ink low, print cartridges OK. Both print cartridges must be present to operate the printer. Leave an empty cartridge in place until it is replaced with a new one. Read the warnings about the proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. The Reference Guide has the complete details on this printer. The DeskJet Toolbox provides functions like cleaning print cartridges. Print cartridges and the print cartridge cradle can be cleaned manually using distilled water and a clean cotton swab. There is an accessory to allow Two_Sided Printing on some DeskJet printers. The guide explains inserting it into the printer and choosing this option on the Toolbox screen. Both manuals can be downloaded from the HP Internet site.It is easier to feed a single sheet if there are other sheets beneath it."
I haven't owned a Sony digital camera in years. Not that Sony cameras are not good; it's just that I always ended up getting a Canon, a Casio, a Fujifilm, a Minolta, a Kodak, or a Pentax. At the moment I use my Nikon D70 for photos that I want to keep or submit for contests, and my Fujifilm F10 for everyday snapshots. But recently I had a chance to play with a Sony DSC-N1 and I was really impressed. I think I'll buy a Sony next time, now that I've accumulated quite a number of Memory Stick PRO Duo cards (for my Sony PSP and Sony camcorders).OK, everyboby knows the N1 has 8.1MP resolution, and the price point is sweet for an ultra-slim, stylish digital camera. The 3x optical zoom is a bit disappointing; I really wish Sony had done something outside the box and gone beyond 3x zoom. (Panasonic has a compact camera that sports a whopping 10x optical zoom coupled with optical image stabilization!) 3x is adequate for most situations, though, so maybe it's no big deal for most casual shooters.But more than the 8.1MP resolution, which makes great enlarged prints, the N1 has excellent image quality. I always say that image quality is much more than resolution; it's more about color reproduction (is red really red and is blue really blue?) and white balance (is white really white?) as well as technical factors like saturation and contrast. Older Sony digital cameras tended to give crisp but dreadful looking pictures. Not the N1. Both indoor and outdoor pictures look terrific, and as long as you have adequate lighting (or use the flash), you'll get pictures that you'll be proud to share with friends. Digital noise does kick in quite a bit at ISO 400, meaning that in dim light situations you'll notice digital specks when you enlarge the picture. But for 4x6, or even 5x7", prints as well as viewing on a PC monitor or HDTV monitor, the N1's image quality comes across as quite satisfactory. What really impressed me was the flash quality, which seemed better than most other compact digital cameras (except Canon ones).So if you want a digital camera with excellent image quality, the N1 should be on your shopping list. Overall I still slightly prefer Canon's image quality, but not by much, just by a little bit. It's probably because my idea of "perfect" image quality matches the calibration parameters chosen by Canon's engineers. However, I know many other people who prefer Sony's crispier looks or Fuji's "scenic, natural" looks, so you may want to compare the N1 with a Canon or something else to see which camera produces the results you personally like the most. Bottomline: the N1's image quality ranks very high among compact digital cameras.Of course, the N1 has many other things going for it, too, like the enormous 3" LCD in the back. The LCD just looks huge because 1) it is, and 2) it takes up most of the real estate of the camera's back. Its resolution is a little over 230k, twice that of most other digital camera's LCDs. This gives a sharp-looking image on the LCD. Ourdoor visibility is good as the LCD is bright. Like Sony's camcorders, this LCD is touch-sensitive, which means you can control camera functions on the LCD itself. I myself am neutral on this. Some people don't like Sony's menu-driven interface and would have preferred a few more buttons. For most casual photographers, this is probably not going to be a big deal.The N1 is beautiful looking, and it has good shooting performance. I'm talking shutter lag here. It's quite fast. Not as fast as a digital SLR like my Nikon D70 or a Canon Digital Rebel XT, but the N1 felt slightly faster than my Fuji F10. This is a camera that performs, period.Battery life is decent; I think the official rating is 300 according to the Japanese CIPA standard. My Fuji F10 is rated at 450 and I swear I've taken close to 1,000 photos (about 40% with flash) and I still have 50% left. I don't know if the N1's battery has the same stamina as my F10. But even at 300 shots per charge, that's pretty good.I want to make two recommendations to any perspective N1 owner:1) Be sure to get a spare battery. Even though the N1's battery life is good, the battery might fail (e.g., in extreme temperatures) or you might forget to recharge it before a new day starts. Always carry a spare if you can afford it.2) The N1 uses Memory Stick Duo, and you'll most likely buy the "PRO" version. (The "PRO" designation simply means the Memory Stick Duo card is over 256MB. Sony's marketing people are nothing short of absolutely stupid and perverted.) You don't have to buy the "high-speed" (red) version of Memory Stick Duo PRO; but as a fellow Amazonian recently told me, the high-speed and regular versions cost the same, so you might as well get the high-speed one. Now comes my tip: buy two or more memory cards instead of a single gigantic-capacity one. Say you want 2GB in total. Get two 1GB Memory Stick PRO Duo cards instead of a single 2GB one. Why? It's the old adage that "don't put all your eggs in one basket." As with the battery, always carry a spare. Trust me, if you don't have a spare battery or memory card, Murphy's Law will get you, sooner than you think, too.In summary, the N1 is a terrific ultra-slim camera. It takes great pictures, is stylish, has a huge touch-sensitive LCD, has good battery life, is reasonably easy to use, and did I mention it takes great pictures? It's good enough for this camera aficionado that my next compact camera will probably be a Sony."
Good quality for its price. It lasts, but the only thing is that when the battery is low it immediately shuts off the Palm.

I bought these earbuds for my CD player (at the time) because the ones I had before died on the right side. They were a pair of RCA behind the neck headphones I bought at Family Dollar for very cheap. I would buy another pair but now I have an iPod and want to buy mostly earbuds and clip headphones that are more portable. I was planning on buying a pair of Philips earbuds at Target because (I thought) these were dead on the right side and I dislike the iPod earbuds, but when I plugged these into my iPod they worked fine. After a break-in session they sound even better.Well, they are only ten bucks, so what can you expect? Not a ton, not a surround soundstage and great, powerful sound, but maybe something that has at least average sound, are comfortable, and will last a decent amount of time. And thatt's mostly what I got with these earbuds.They don't have stellar sound (that for some reason a ton of reviews rave about), but they have decent sound that's good enough for the money. Not a lot of bass, but some pairs at this price have barely any bass. The mids on this pair are emphazised (but not by a lot, props to Sony). And they do have a good, clean sound to them, so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper end.For other aspects of the earbuds, they are very comfortable and fit much better than the Apple earbuds, but feel better with the pads. I have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time. Also, these are some durable headphones so far, and after a half-year of use they still put up nicely.Overall, not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables. Already got a better pair? Keep these for some useful back-ups. They don't have amazing sound, but are comfortable and last long enough to make them worth the price. 4 stars.NOTE: This is a waterproof version of the MDRE828LP earbuds. These would be a better deal if you are using them mostly outdoors.

This cartridge is very light, easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality, durable black ink on the page. It is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (It even comes with an expiration date!) HP also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit.One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the ink can go quickly. If you print a lot, you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. My needs are about 20 pages per week and I have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks. That's not good; although to be fair to this HP ink cartridge I am printing graphics.Four stars (well, maybe three and one half stars) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge. It loses points for not lasting longer.
Iomega Zip 250MB SCSI DriveThis device has a rectangular dark blue case powered by a separate power supply. It connects to the parallel port on your computer, attached when power is off. You should select the icon to Unplug or Eject Hardware" to remove this device. The IOMEGA software should be installed on Windows 2000. If the unit does not have an eject button on the drive you must select the EJECT command from the Properties menu. It is good to do this all the time because of the disk caching system. The 250 MB drives can read and write to 100 MB ZIP disks, but slower than with a 250 MB disk. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an IOMEGA disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords (not usable on a 100MB disk). "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details.Computers have a limited number of IDE devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical. Replaceable 250 MB ZIP disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology. The 250 MB ZIP disk is less widely used than the 100 MB disk. ZIP disks reuse deleted space unlike a CD whose space is consumed when you replace files. Falling prices for CD discs solve that problem. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different Windows systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by different software on another system. [You may find support on the Internet for USB Mass Storage Devices for Win98.]To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: "SCSI controllers", "Iomega", "Iomega Parallel Port Interface", then "Finish".You should set the Printer Port as EPP or ECP.Then modify the 'Settings' for the Iomega Parallel Port Interface as follows.The port settings assumes the usual I/O address.'My Computer'; 'Properties'; 'System Devices'; 'Device Manager';'SCSI Controllers'; 'Iomega Parallel Port Interface'; 'Properties'; 'Settings'/mode:eppecr /port:378 /speed:6"
Belkin makes a great USB 2.0 cable to connect computer hardware together for the ultimate computer experience! The cord is cheap, backward compatible and it does the job very reliably.I recently purchased a new printer and used this product after having used it to hook up for old printer to my current computer. The cable made hardware recognition and setup remarkably easy as data was transmitted incredibly fast between the printer and the computer.Hey, I'm no computer technician expert who can speak in fancy computerese" terms; but when people say this USB 2.0 cable does the job and more they truly must mean it. I have no complaints about this cable.I highly recommend this product by Belkin for people who need a USB cable. It sure is inexpensive; and you get great quality and value for your buck.Get one today if you need it--you won't be disappointed."
IOMEGA ZIP 100 DiskThe IOMEGA ZIP 100 disk is a high-capacity removable storage disk that is about the size of a standard 3.5 floppy disk. It can be read and written by an internal IDE drive (only one per system) or an external drive connected to a USB port or a parallel port (slowest in access). The IomegaWare Software provides utility functions designed for the ZIP disk, such as formatting or copying a disk. You should never use the Operating System disk copy function. Use the EJECT utility to remove a disk from a drive; this is required in Windows NT or Windows 2000. Remove the disk before turning a computer off You should never insert a ZIP disk in the drive when the computer is on as this can cause damage. Normally, shutting down the computer causes the disk to eject. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole.The IomegaWare software tests for the presence of the ZIP drive. It should be used in Windows 2000 to format a ZIP disk in the FAT format. Removable disks can contain a lot of data when it can be partitioned into 100 MB segments. The data on a ZIP drive can be read and written by different versions of an Operating System (using the FAT format). Rewriting reuses space, it does not increase the used space. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat (sunshine). The 100 MB ZIP disks can be read and written by a 250 MB disk drive.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
This adapter works ok. Make sure it works with your TV's color space first! Other than that, a decent product.
It is a replacement inkjet cartridge. It works as well as one would expect. I have never used a different type cartridge to see if the colors are different with this printer. I have used a couple of these replacement cartridges, and they are excellent.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Viking 128MB Secure Digital Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Ok - you're all set to record an interview. Your interviewer has one radio lapel mic and their subject has been mic'ed with your backup radio mic on a different frequency, but they have the mic way too close to their mouth and dwarf the interviewer. You have a stereo shotgun mic on your hotshoe mount for B-roll footage and you're ready to go.....Except for the fact you have 3 microphone sources and your camcorder has one stereo mic input - plus your two radio mics have different output levels causing one channel to clip occasionally as your two radio mics have unequal levels and you must unplug everything to use your shotgun stereo mic, which isn't easy to do with today's tiny cameras.That's where this comes in. There are 4 jacks and 3 sliders on this compact product just slightly bigger than a DV tape in its case.You have inputs 1 and 2 which are left and right mono inputs great for radio mics, each with their own amplitude slider to get your levels equalized and bring two separate mono sources to a stereo output. Input 3 is a stereo input for a stereo microphone that you might use in shooting b-roll footage. If you want to kill it from the interview mix, just slide the volume for mic 3 all the way down and its gone. You can also mix in some of the ambient sound with a touch of the 3rd slider.Sure it would be nice to have a mixing board on the back of your hand strap to manage audio, right? This is the only product I could find that even comes close. The next step is a 4 channel audio production set which dwarfs the size of most camcorders today. On the back of this case is a clip which can be rotated 90 degrees into 4 positions to clip onto anything and hold on tight.Since everything is passive and well shielded noise is not an issue, but be sure your mics are powered (most video cameras want separately powered mics anyways, even if it is a button cell in the mic case). The very low output from unpowered dynamic capsules won't do as well as a condenser mic with a button cell inside giving you 7mv RMS or so of output.The mixer comes with 2 cables, a mono-stereo and a stereo-stereo to connect it's 4th jack (stereo mic mix out) to your camera's stereo external mic in. All jacks are 3.5 mm, 1&2 are mono, 3&4 are stereo (with 4 being the mix output and 3 being the stereo mic in)This is a great accessory for anyone with more than one mic in use on a portable camera and at the price it's a very affordable solution for the convenience in setup it offers. If you have ever cursed that your camera doesn't have 3 mic-inputs with knobs for each, then this is the next best thing, and easier to use while shooting than the camera's controls.There is one really minor negative that won't affect most users - being a passive device not requiring a battery, this mixer will not output a signal higher than the input signals from your sources. If used with powered mics this is not a problem, but really low level outputs will be low level going into your camera. If you know you want to record a weak signal (say an electric guitar) you'll want a pre-amp to go on that signal. You can attenuate strong signals down with this to get equality.My unit stays with my 2 radio mics and receivers in their case and gets used every time I hook up external mics to my camera. It is a clean and lightweight solution to a messy cable problem in the field. I give it 5 stars because it handles most everything in an elegant simple manner with a minimum number of parts and is designed for today's smaller HD camcorders. Form definitely follows function in the product design.
The iPod first appeared four years ago, and the features continue to grow, with each update.The iPod with video playback was introduced on October 13, 2005. However, one should not necessarily consider this player a video player, but a great iPod music player, with video capabilities as a fantastic bonus. Nevertheless, the iPod with video playback is the most capable and feature-rich iPod ever produced by Apple.Video Playback - The iPod plays back H264 and MPEG4 encoded video. The iPod's new display is larger than ever at 2.5 inches, giving it a resolution of 320x240. What video content can you play on your iPod? This area is limited, at least currently. You can buy music videos on iTunes at $1.99 per song, which will play beautifully on the iPod. Furthermore, Apple has made available select television shows, for download on iTunes. They cost $1.99 per episode, for titles including ABC's hits Lost and Desperate Housewives. You can also watch the episodes you purchase on your computer. If you want to put some of your own video, onto your iPod, you will need to use an application such as QuickTime Pro to convert the video to the specific requirements to play on the iPod. You can also find video podcasts, which will play on the new iPod. Even if you do not plan to view video on the new iPod, its primary purpose is to be used as the world's best music player. You can still benefit from the beautiful new display, for it will help you find your favorite music faster, and you can view the album art that accompanies your music.Size of new iPod - Does the picture of the new iPod make it appear larger to you? Well, it did to me. The iPod looked wider, in the photos I saw. However, it is not. The height and width of the iPod are identical to the previous generation iPod with click wheel. The only change in dimensions is the depth. The new iPod is actually thinner than what came before it! Yes, this 30 gig iPod is thinner than the previous 20 gig photo model by 30 percent. What does all this mean? The iPod continues get smaller, making it even easier to carry.Capacity - This 30 gig iPod has room, for a lot of entertainment. With storage, for up to 7,500 songs, 12,000 photos, or 75 hours of video. The great thing I love about my iPod is that my music, photos, and video only take up about 15 gigabytes. However, I use the additional space to backup data, from my computer. This is incredibly helpful, and could be a real saver, if something happened to your computer. See, the iPod functions as an external hard drive, so you can backup all sorts of data. The 60 gig version is available, for $100 more, so if you want to use it for lots of video, or you have an enormous music collection, you may want to consider that larger version, which also sports longer battery life.New Software Features - Apple has added features, to the new iPod besides video support. First, they have a clock feature, which quickly allows you to view the time, in up to four different time zones simultaneously. Furthermore, there is a stop watch, and a screen lock, which you can enable to keep people from snooping on your calendar and/or contacts.Battery - The battery life is one of the most important specifications that you, as an iPod user, are going to care about. This 30 gigabyte iPod sports a battery that will last up to 14 hours, when playing only music. Also note that repeatedly changing songs manually, and turning on the backlight will use up your battery considerably faster. Furthermore, the iPod's battery lasts a maximum of two hours, when playing back video. This version of the iPod no longer includes an adapter to charge the iPod, at an electrical outlet. You will have to buy that adapter separately, or always charge the iPod via USB 2.0. The charging works fine, from your computer's USB 2.0, but if you're traveling you might want the ability to charge, with the adapter. Also note that the iPod no longer supports syncing via firewire cable. You will have to use USB 2.0.Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. The iPod syncs your contacts, video, and music via the iTunes software.Podcasting - The iPod continues to support podcasting. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, for this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box. There are also video podcasts, so with the new iPod, you will be able to watch video podcasts, on the iPod's display.Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. The new iPod is available in a black or white finish. The black color is quickly becoming the most popular, but the white iPod is still the signature color. Do note that the black may show fingerprints and scratches more than the white iPod, much as a black car shows these blemishes more than a lighter colored car.Audiobooks - I'm always using my iPod, to listen to audiobooks. You can store literally hundreds of audiobooks on here that you buy from iTunes, or Audible. The iPod even has a feature that can slow down or speed up the reading of the audiobook, so that you hear it at just the right pace.Output - The iPod connects to your PC or Mac via the dock connector at the bottom of the unit. You will connect the included cable, to the computer via a USB 2.0 port. Furthermore, accessories are being made that will also connect to the bottom dock port, and you may purchase Apple's Universal iPod dock, for easy syncing to your computer. The dock (available separately) also includes s-video output, so you can show off slideshows and video, on a television. There are also iPod A/V cables available that allow composite video and audio output, for connecting your iPod to your television. This might interest you, not only to display slideshows on a television, but also to display TV shows or music videos on a television, which you purchased from iTunes.Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Enjoy your iPod experience.
These CD-Rs are golden--both literally and figuratively! The quality of the sound I record onto them is a perfect copy of the sound from the source CD-R. Moreover, how can you beat a 300 year life expectancy? They'll survive longer than I will!On the very bright side, these are manufactured with what Amazon notes is phthalocyanine, the best organic dye currently available." Awesome! It is scratch and fingerprint resistant, too--I tested it!On the down side, once in a while these CD-Rs can be fussy about which recording equipment they'll work with. However, they will work with the average PC and CD player. The packaging could be better, too: they arrive merely in the clear plastic wrap surrounded by bubble wrap so they don't get bumped around in transit. For the price you pay they ought to come in a protective cylinder shaped plastic shell!All in all, however, these CD-Rs are excellent for data and audio storage. I highly recommend them as very attractive alternatives to standard, run of the mill store brand CD-R blank media. They are especially resilient against fingerprints and scratches; and their life expectancy just can't be beat! Awesome! SMILES"
Have used mine for over 3 years now, and never needed to clean anything! Mouse movement is precise and smooth, and it's pure plug-n-play. It can't get easier than this. Solid quality, will probably last a lifetime... hopefully I'll live a long life. :)
UPDATE (march 10, 2005)Well, I take back the 4-star rating I gave a few weeks ago. I now have serious doubts about Netgear's quality control. I say this because 1) my Netgear router (from this kit) stopped working after just two weeks, and 2) my web search revealed that this is a *common* problem.I wish Amazon could let me revise the rating. I'd now give this kit a 2-star rating. The PC Card, which I have been using heavily, still works fine, although the end plastic (where you hold the card) is coming off loose. At least it still works and does a good job at pulling in and maintaining wi-fi signal.But the router's poor quality pissed me off. It stopped working exactly two weeks after I set it up. All of a sudden I just couldn't get on the Internet. I hadn't done a thing to provoke this. I tried connecting to the net using my old Linksys and D-Link routers; both worked fine. Once I switched back to the Netgear WGR614 router, once again I would lose Internet altogether. I repeated this a dozen times on two different days, resetting the router seven or eight times total in the process, all to no avail, so my conclusion was my router broke.I dialed Netgear's tech support, which is a toll-free number, but I was on hold for too long that I gave up. I'll try again tomorrow, but right now (3/10/05) I'm not hopeful.Given how commonplace this not-working-out-of-nowhere" problem seems, I caution anyone against buying Netgear products, until they improve their quality. BTW, the box of my Netgear kit says "made in Taiwan," but the router and PC Card are both labeled "made in China.""
When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer. The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world. In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini. Why? They had something better: the iPod Nano.Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, impossibly small," and "magic." While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges is very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.Storage - This 2-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 500 songs. For $50 more, you can buy the 4-gigabyte, which olds approximately 1000 songs. If you think the higher capacity could be useful to you, the $50, for an extra 2-gigabytes is a good value. However, if you're on a budget, or are not so concerned with capacity, this 2-gigabyte model will get the job done. 500 songs is a lot of music, so you will rarely find yourself in a situation, where you need more than that.Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.Color - White is the traditional iPod color. This white iPod Nano will match your iMac, iBook, or other Apple products. Furthermore, the white is less likely to show scratches and fingerprints. It is a good idea to protect your iPod Nano, if you're concerned about its appearance. The chrome finish, on the back, is particularly prone to scratches.Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason."
I bought this cable to connect my Playstation 3 to an HDTV set that has only DVI (I think it's DVI-I) but no HDMI. This cable works beautifully. Image quality is really good. The price just can't be beat.You should be aware that while HDMI carries both audio and video, DVI is video only, so you still need to route the audio to your TV somehow. For example, I use an optical digital audio cable to do that (together with an expensive converter box as my old HDTV set doesn't have an optical input).
[update 1-15-2011] we are upgrading our backbone to managed switches - the latest batch of trendnet TEG160WS units didn't have a fan inside -- infact to make sure I put a wattmeter on it and they only draw 11watts with 8/16 ports in use at 1gbps. My assumtion is they redesigned the product to be more green since it runs 24/7 and were able to yank the noisy fan. You can still replace the fans on the older units with 40mm fans with ball bearings)[end of update]With gigabit ethernet sometimes insufficient to link backbones a common technique has emerged to aggregate to channels to get a 2Gbps link instead. My NAS Raid5 synology arraySynology DiskStation 5-Bay (Diskless) Scalable Network Attached Storage DS1010+ (Black)supports this with 2 gig-e jacks on the back, as do several lan cards on servers these days.The advantage is you can build a backbone between switches that has 2gbps capacity and connect to your server or NAS box with this aggregated 2x speed link, then plug in multiple 1x gig-e devices to the switches along the way. This makes for efficient low cost backbone design and serves the need using off the shelf parts and smart switches like this.The trendnet switch is also a value compared to the cisco 8 port which runs about $100 - 2 of those would cost more than this and you would use 4 ports just linking the two switches together if you use an aggregate backbone design.As for the fan noise - it can be quieted down - the fans that come from the factory are cheap 1u size fans, but computer stores for home pc builders sell high quality ball bearing fans that are the same size but do not make the buzz of the trendnet fans. They have the same hole pattern, voltage, and plug so swapout is easy and quiets down your box without sacrificing airflow. I'll post links when I can find some for sale on amazon so other users can kill off the acoustic noise.one last note - the amazon dimentions are wrong - this is a standard rackmount product measuring 440 x 210 x 44mm (17.3 x 8.3 x 1.73in.)
I just got this and my first impressions are totally positive. I bought it because I was really sick and tired of the dangling headphone wire, which sometimes gets caught on my jacket or other things. I'm surprised that there aren't many products like this.With support for MP3 and AAC (advanced audio coding, a better-than-MP3 audio format developed by Dolby), the SD05 can hold up to 2 hours of hi-fi music. It's surprisingly easy to operate, and because it's foldable, easy to transport, too. The manual is a bit skimpy, but I think most people can figure it out pretty quick. The headset itself is comfortable, although I wish there were more bass.
I was pretty much looking for any inexpensive wireless mouse and keyboard. I saw this to be one of the most inexpensive (I won't say cheap) ones avaliable.As far as communciation, so far it has been excellent. The mouse took a restart to connect but everything connected and went smoothly.The keyboard is pretty much your standard keyboard but with additional features. The media feature does not seem to work, my guess is that it works for MusicMatch since it is on the CD. The play/pause button will pause and play your music, this worked in all of my music programs (Windows Media and RealPlayer). The mute and voulme controls worked perfectly. There is a favorites button to open your browser's favorites, the e-mail button open Outlook Express, and the www button goes to your home page.The mouse is your basic mouse with a scroll. So far it has been very accurate with the reciever, though don't be too suprised if your photo editing gets rough a few times. It is optical and it does not need a trackball and uses a laser.One of the negatives is the battery life. It is around the area were AA batteries last, which is 15-20 hours. This is ok for some users, but for people using the computer daily for a few hours, that would mean you would have to replace the mouse around 2 times a week, which could get costy. The keyboard doesn't run the entire time you use the computer so it shouldn't be too bad.It is compatible with Windows 95 and above as well as the latest Mac operating systems. The keyboard can be run on USB or the PS/2 Port but the mouse must use the PS/2. The USB is the slim long port and the PS/2 port (usually colored) is the circle port.As far as the CD, it contains software but chances are your computer has them already from the Control Panel. There is some adware along with the CD as well. I wold just leave the install CD alone and just plug-and-play.Overall, this set does have a few quirks, but it is definitely worth the low-cost. 4 stars.
This inexpensive portable CD player from Panasonic combines an excellent basic CD discman with MP3 capabilities. You can play regular CD's and CD-R or CD-RW discs burned with audio CD content (i.e., CD-DA" Compact Disc Digital Audio format), just like any CD player. When playing CD's it has two anti-skip modes, one 10-second and the other 45-second. The single sheet of user's guide says the 10-second memory mode gives better sound quality. There are two EQ settings in addition to the plain "none" level: XBS and "Live". As you would expect, as a CD discman the SL-MP70 delights with its light weight and good looks.But you can also play MP3 files burned onto CD-R or CD-RW discs. You can burn MP3 files to CD-R/RW discs in two ways: use a program like Windows Media Player or iTunes to convert MP3 back to CD-DA, and burn the disc as an audio CD. Then what you get is exactly a regular audio CD. Or, to save time and effort -- and remember that since MP3 is a lossy format, converting an MP3 file back to CD-DA does not improve the audio quality, i.e., "garbage in, garbage out" -- you can simply drag and drop the MP3 files to a CD-R or CD-RW disc and burn them. When viewed in Windows, the CD-R/RW looks like a regular folder with the MP3 files. Then you can play these files on the SL-MP70. The player recognizes the files gracefully. (The slightly more expensive SL-MP80 model can also play WMA files -- that's Windows Media Audio format, developed by Microsoft.)Unlike another, cheaper Panasonic discman, this one can display MP3 tags, basically information embedded in each MP3 file that has the track name, album name, artist name, etc. The SL-MP70 displays the track name and album name if they are available. If you download music in the MP3 format, chances are the guy who ripped it already put in the tags, also known as "ID3." If not, you can use a program like Music Match to edit the tags yourself.Note that, if you buy music Apple iTunes-style from sites like Walmart and Music Match, they only sell the music in the WMA format, not MP3, so you'd need the SL-MP80 player to play them.Some other observations:Good - the player remembers the last track or MP3 file you played, so when you turn it back on, it resumes from the point it left off. I don't think you can turn this off with this model.Puzzling - you cannot fast search within an MP3 track, although you can do so within an audio CD track. This is not a problem unless you are like me and carry audio books encoded in MP3. These books tend to have chapters that last more than 15 minutes. Luckily for me, my commute is 1 hour each way, so I have no problem with this. Also, most music MP3 tracks are no more than 4 minutes, so this shouldn't be a major problem.Good - Long battery life. I run this off 2 AA NiMH batteries (1800 mAh each) and I've run on the same set for over 20 hours of play and I still see three full bars on the battery indicator. And yes, the battery indicator has three bars and goes to none when the batteries are near exhaustion. This is really energy efficient, and is one thing that sets this apart from the cheaper/lesser-brand products from Classic, Samsung, Memorex, iriver, etc.Could be better - more volume for those nearly hearing-impaired thanks to their 24x7 listening on earphones habit, easier to get to the last of 1000 MP3 files (as if you'd do that often), backlighting (but that'd surely raise the price), remote control (ditto). Really, for this price, I think we are already getting a lot of bang for the buck, and the build quality of Panasonic players is just top-notch. And no, I don't work for Panasonic or any of its agents or distributors, and nobody in my family or circle of friends does, either!Tip - to get around the "press forward 99 times to get to the 100th song or 999 times to get to the 1000th song" problem, put a dozen songs in each folder. The Panasonic automatically designates each folder an album, and you can skip to the next album by holding down the fast-forward button.In summary, the SL-MP70 is a stylish and very dependable CD/MP3 player. Highly recommended for those who don't need a separate MP3 player like iPod or RCA Lyra."
Here's a simple, inexpensive digital camera that you can carry all day and take low-res pictures and capture brief low-res videos. You don't have to worry about breaking anything. This Chinese-manufactured cute little thing is all plastic but quite solid. It also works very well as a webcam -- no surprise since Logitech has been building these for a long time.Would have been better if the battery life were a bit better and the resolution a bit higher. But then again, at this price, this is a no-brainer toy to own.

A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.Storage - This is the new 1 GB version of the iPod Nano. Apple released the 1 GB version, to have an entry-level nano priced at only $150. You get all the features of the 2 & 4 GB models, but simply less storage for songs. If having less songs to carry around is ok with you, save some money with this player.Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.Color - The white nano is my favorite, for its the traditional iPod color. The black nano looks beautiful too, but scratches show more easily.Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.
Ok, this isn't one of my usual hands-on reviews. I ain't got the kind of money to buy all these cameras and test them. But I wanted to give potential buyers some help...Should you consider an SLR-type EVF (electronic viewfinder) digital camera or an interchangeable-lens digital SLR for serious photography? I faced this question and agonized over it for months. I wish I had come across this brief and very helpful article by Popular Photography Magazine (I'm not affiliated with them in any way):[...]The article compares five current-model EVF cameras: Canon PowerShot Pro 1, Konica-Minolta Dimage A2, Nikon Coolpix 8700, Olympus Camedia C-8080, and Sony Cybershot DSC-F828. It's a very easy read, and at the end the writers give you a helpful checklist for the EVF vs. d-SLR decision.As for myself, I'm going with a d-SLR since I want 1) high-quality lens, 2) lens choices, 3) little to no shutter lag, and 4) accessory choices. Good luck!
As with all Lowepro camera gear the quality is exceptional. I was first given the smaller version of this (the -1) on the amazon vine program - I used it for my dad's olympus E300 camera but it did not fit my olympus E3 with the battery extender underneath. I bought the -2 larger version for twenty bucks and was very impressed by the value. Underneath the pouch there is a velcro compartment with a rain poncho in case you get into wet weather. There is also a belt loop, handle on top, and a shoulder strap to carry the camera. It's fast to get into by loading from the top and can accommodate longer lenses than the -1 version of the bag.As an example of the bag's quality design, there is a zipper inside that seals the inside pouch for media. Even the zipper is covered by a leather flap to protect the camera from scratches caused by the zipper. Ordinary cases would just use velcro or omit the leather flap to protect the camera resulting in scratched camera equipment.Basically I was so pleased with the construction of the -1 that I tried that I bought the -2 for myself. The quality of the -2 size is the same as the size 1 version, and the -2 version has a larger pocket on the outside and inside to store accessories. Plus I can put my E3 with the dual battery attachment into the -2 size bag as well as a longer lens.I've already found the bag handy to have on hand with my camera to catch an event quickly. Without it I would not have brought my camera with me. It's a very well built with padding all over and economical at this price, prefect for my olympus e3.
Small, compact, very easy to useCharges batter quickly and easy to travel with
This official Panasonic camcorder battery also works for the new VDR-D300 and VDR-D250 3CCD DVD camcorders. I had checked Panasonic's website to confirm before I bought it for my VDR-D300. It works very well.As a gadget expert (if there were such a thing), I highly recommend getting an official battery. Sure, the generics can cost 1/3 as much, but you run serious and real risks of getting an explosion or other undesirable results. I don't say this because I work for Panasonic; I don't work for any electronics company or any electronics store. I say it because I believe 1) a real battery is a worthy long-term investment for your expensive camcorder, and 2) your life and well-being are worth more than the price difference. You also save yourself lots of hassles down the road.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media 128MB Translucent Memory Stick, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I bought this high-speed MSD (Memory Stick Duo) card to use with Windows Vista's ReadyBoost feature. (ReadyBoost uses a high-speed flash memory card to cache certain system files in lieu of using the hard disk, thus boosting system performance.) It works really well. I also tested its general read/write speed by copying large files as well as many small files. On my Sony VAIO laptop (with a built-in MSD reader) the speed is phenomenal.This card is also compatible with the PSP, although it does not provide any speed advantage as the PSP is happy with regular-speed MSD cards (which cost only half as much). The high speed feature can be taken advantage of in certain Sony digital cameras when it comes to continuous shooting.I have several Memory Stick and Memory Stick Duo cards and they have all been reliable and faithful.BTW, the PRO" designation in this product's name simply means it's more than 512MB. (The pre-512MB Memory Sticks carried no PRO designation.) This card is also MagicGate compatible meaning it can be used in certain Sony products that require copy protection schemes. Neither of these designations matters to most users. You can use this card safely in all Sony and other MSD-compatible devices."
The iP2000 from Canon is a capable photo printer for occasional use. It boasts high speed and excellent photo quality. In the end I paid $20 more and got the iP3000 instead because (according to my Staples sales guy) the iP3000 allows individual color tanks, so when you run out of one ink you don't need to replace all the colors.Of course, in reality the colors tend to run out more or less at the same time.
The RM-CB1 is used on multiple Olympus cameras. I'll break the review into a tecnical review first and a fun stuff section you can omit. DSLR cameras have some unique advantages in the scientific and research fields which the RM-CB1 opens up to you such as bulb exposures without vibration, long term sequenced shooting, multiple camera syncing, and event syncronized timing. Lab geeks will have a blast.Technical summary:The RM-CB1 is relatively simple - a copy of the shutter release on your camera, plus a mechanical lock that holds it down for bulb exposures (on a tripod), a one meter high quality cable, and a 3 pin screw-down plug for the camera. The jack/plug are nonstandard so you won't find them at the local electronics store, however, the back of the handle can be removed with one screw, and you can solder wires there where the cable comes in to attach your own trigger systems (I have one that captures lightning strike photos - the camera is preset, the shutter button is halfway pressed with a toggle switch, and when the moment arrives, my preset manual exposure and infinity focus settings are used to capture the event)How it works:There are two stranded wires in the cable plus a shield for a total of 3 conductors. The brown conductor is the half press" equivalent when connected to the ground / shield. After this has happened, the camera will focus, so I put a toggle switch on it to hold the camera ready for the shot (have dual batteries or an AC adapter if you plan to wait a long time). Connecting the red lead to ground takes the exposure.Depending on the model, you can take multiple exposures by multiple closures between red and ground without opening the brown to ground circuit - you need to test the "half press" logic in your camera.CAUTIONS / MISC applicationsAfter the E300 the remote cable release became a usb device and has a different part number. I don't own one of these backs because I didn't know how the USB version worked, but my friends do and have engineered similar interfaces, so you're not left out in the cold if that's what you have.As of the olympus E3 they switched back to the RM-CB1 plug again, which was one of the reasons I bought an E3.Making your own exposure control means you need to know the various delays - I use an Agilent frequency counter that can be set to count 1/10,000,000ths of a second from start to stop (one ten millionth of a second - way more than you need). Don't pay attention to more than the first 1000's of a second thogh - there are delays in relays between two poles when you run a clock that fast and the camera will vary depending on its temperature. The E300 has different delays depending on what you want it to do - if you PRESET exposure, focus, and just trigger it you can expose it in under 0.09 seconds (9/100's or 90/1000's of a second) on an E300 which is fast enough for lightning. I use a fast shutter speed and photograph the agilent timer to see when the exposure was taken.E300's go for $187 now on ebay so you can buy several and use sequential timers between them for mini-high-speed photography. If you know when an event will happen - you start the first camera at -0.090 seconds on the first timer (omron makes these and can be found at grainger's industrial section) - timer output two is triggered by the first then fires the second camera at +0.020 seconds while timer three and camera three fire at +.040 seconds giving you 3 exposures only 2 hundredths of a second apart which can capture rapid motion inexpensively. Most of the hardware can be found on ebay to wire this up except the RM-CB1! The omron timers can be accurate down to 1/1000 second.The Bullet and the Apple - can you shoot that? In theory, yes. If your camera takes .094 seconds from the red circuit closing until it opens the shutter, then you need to know how far behind the apple to put a detector for the bullet about .1 second before it hits the apple and use it to trigger the camera (don't forget the time needed to detect the bullet). I haven't done this but I'd recommend very slow bullets or else long ranges to shoot! You could even condense this somewhat because it takes time for a gun to fire from the time the hammer falls which is to your advantage and another way to accomplish this. Moving the apple gives you some help too. Other options are a nightime bulb exposure and just syncing a flash on the apple based on how fast it fires which can be measured again with an Agilent frequency counter.The RM-CM1 is your entry into electronic, time lapse, high speed, automatic exposure, astronomic shots and a whole lot of fun beyond "normal" picture taking. Because I use my E300's in a lab I've done alot with this part. I like the fact that olympus cameras can be acquired inexpensively and take 8MP+ scientific photos under $1000 and still be used for "normal" portraits or bulb photos stabilized on a tripod with the remote release.Fortunately the digital format gives you the result immediately and you can adjust if you just miss a shot to get it the next time. Be sure to bring a bushel of apples!"
The product works fine and I had no trouble getting it from the vendor
No, the SD10 is not perfect. For one thing, it could use some optical zoom. There is *always* a situation that arises when you do need to zoom in just a little bit. Digital zoom never does it for me. So Canon, please add optical zoom (even if a paltry 2x) and this will be a 10-out-of-five camera!That said, the SD10 is perfect for the snap-happy. Count yours truly as one. It's a take-anywhere-snap-anywhere-view-anywhere-hide-anywhere kind of camera. The four megapixels are nice, and the picture quality is nothing short of astonishing, at this super compact size or at any size. BTW, the number of pixels usually does not translate directly into picture quality, just as a CPU's megahertz rating doesn't correlate directly with a system's overall speed. But Canon engineers are a bunch of smart monkeys, indeed, and every Canon digital camera out in the last three years has just been totally fabulous in the picture quality department.What makes a digital picture top-quality? The colors have to be natural-looking and balanced, preferably both indoors and outdoors. There shouldn't be any digitized artifacts (like glowing edges of your new kitchen knife or pixelated pimples on your kid's face). The white should be white and the black black. Above all, one look at the picture and you go, wow, this is one nice shot!" (assuming it's meant to be one nice shot). The SD10, happily, delivers in all these aspects. One could wish for a longer flash range, but, alas, that's why serious photographers like me have to keep an old-style SLR film baby around with a hotshoe on it. If you want serious flash, man, you have to use an external flash. The SD10 does well what it was designed to do.I really don't want to talk to you about the tech specs. They are meaningless in the real world anyway. To sum it up, the SD10 is a camera you'll be happy with and you'll probably fall in love with -- a gadget freak like yourself likes all nice gadgets but we don't fall in love easily, but the SD10 deserves to be loved. If you are anything more than a casual photographer, I recommend you *also* buy a "more serious" model like the Canon S410 or Minolta Xg which has more controls and does come with optical zoom, and use the SD10 as a candid shooter. But, seriously, this is a great camera for all kinds of photographers -- and gadget freaks."
I really don't understand why people blame Amazon or Palm for this cable while the description clearly says it's for certain models, and says it's for models with the universal connector. I wish people would take responsibility for themselves more.Anyway, I got this cable because my office PC runs NT, and it doesn't support USB. The serial cable works perfectly. It doesn't charge your Palm (I have the T2), unlike the USB charge/hotsync cable, and speed is low compared to USB, but it gets the work done.There is, however, one caveat: you cannot transfer MP3 files with the serial cable, because Real Player cannot recognize it. Palm should really move away from Real and opt for something better; Real is all about bloatware and spyware -- I don't know a single soul who likes its intrusive &quot;message center&quot; annoyance.The workaround is you'll need to copy the MP3 files to the SD card directly, into the &quot;\music&quot; folder on the card. If you have a laptop with an SD slot, you'll be fine. But chances are if you are still running NT, your laptop won't have the slot. Also all SD card readers are USB. So in the end, it's probably best to upgrade, or borrow your friend's win2k or XP machine.In short, this cable is cheap and light and seems durable (if you take care in disconnecting the Palm).
The RF-11 assembly is designed to take advantage of the bayonet mount found on all 67 mm filter assemblies and the FR-1 adapter tube for the 50mm macro lens (the FR-1 forms an extention tube in front of the lens to protect the full focus extension and has the 67 mm filter thread needed for the TF-22 and also the 67mm bayonet system needed for the RF-11)I have no idea why amazon says it needs the SR-1. The SR-1 is ONLY for the TF-22, in fact they say the TF-22 needs the SR-1 - the TF-22 SHIPS with the SR-1. Amazon needs to correct this error because the SR-1 is hard to find anywhere!. It also doesn't need the FR-1 unless you have the 50mm macro lens.The RF11 will lock onto the 14-54 and the 50-200 mm lenses with just a 30 degree twist to engage the bayonets that normally hold the lens hood. As for a flash, it's as powerful as any GN36, but exceptionally parallel to the lens, with no shadow cast by the lens as with flashes mounted above the lens.For greater light control, the GN22 TF-22 twin flash should be used in extreme cases (and it DOES come with the SR-1 to hold the two flashes - see my reviews on theOlympus TF-22 Twin Flash Head (Needs FC-01 Flash Controller, FR-1 & SR-1)for more info there)Most people will want the ring flash first, and then get to the twin flash when their needs dictate. The extra light from the ring flash makes for some great portrait shots. As with the twin flash, the ring flash has 4 modeling lights in the corners to aid in locating the flash reflection in your composition before shooting. They also come on automatically for focus if you have the AF set to use the modeling lights.This is a specialized flash that can be used out to about 6 meters or so - beyond that I would switch to the FL-50. It can be used down to 6 inches and below that I would switch to the TF-22.One last thing - exposure adjustment is no longer done with the +/- key on the camera when using the lens mounted flashes. TheOlympus FC-01 Macro Flash Controller (for use with TF-22 & RF-11 Flash Heads)has on it a dial for +/- 3 EV stops that controls the flashes directly. The camera exposure control is not active when using these flashes.All together the flash system is very well designed as the high voltage power supplies work with any flash (the FL-50 and FC-01 are in the same body and accept the FP-1 and SHV-01 power supplies). For close up works they can't be beat.
It works great, The seller Eforcity shipped out the same day, Lightning fast shipping. Thanks arrived exactly as described. Repeat customer never dissapointed.
IMPORTANT UPDATE (Dec. 2005): Do NOT buy the official Nikon EN-EL3 battery! It has been recalled by Nikon due to short circuit hazard. Details can be found at nikonusa dot com (click the EN-EL3 battery recall" link). Repeat: this model has been recalled by Nikon, so do not buy. The EN-EL3a or EN-EL3b are compatible replacement models for the EN-EL3. Neither is subject to recall.My original review from Jan. 2005 follows:This "genuine" Nikon EN-EL3 battery works in the D70 and D100 digital SLR cameras. The origin can be either Japan or China; apparently Nikon outsources the manufacturing to other companies. (I was able to verify this countries of origin information on Nikon's website.) For $15 cheaper you can get a compatible battery made by a company that licenses Energizer's brand; just search for "EN-EL3" here on Amazon and pick the one that says "by Energizer." That one is also good and although it's a generic, it does have the Energizer name (even if not actually made by Energizer). You might want to check that out. Of course, if you are super-concerned about safety -- personal and equipment -- you should stick with the official Nikon-licensed battery, which is this one."
Skullcandy makes these headphones; and they are far and away the best set of headphones I've ever had! Just one listen to my portable CD player through these and I was hooked for life. They are remarkably comfortable and they do an excellent job of blocking out all the noise from the room or wherever you may be.The headphones have ear cups" that at first may seem less than completely flexible. Don't worry--within one or two more listens and the ear cups conform perfectly to your ears. They fit relatively snugly without ever being uncomfortable. The headband is adjustable, too, so you can expand or contract the size of the headset.Although these don't come with a warranty (at least where I bought them), you might not need one. They're very reliable and sturdy. Obviously, don't play football with these things; they can break and that somewhat short cord between the earphones and the plug into your equipment is perhaps a bit too short. As one reviewer suggests, you may want some sort of extension cord to rectify this minor inconvenience but that's probably all you're going to need.In addition, these headphones have a small but easy to use feature: a small knob you can move back and forth with your fingertip to adjust the level of the sound independent of the portable CD player or whatever you're listening to. This impresses me as it makes the volume louder than the CD player might be able to go. Great!Overall, I highly recommend these headphones. You can't go wrong."
These TDK 8 cm (3 in.) DVD-R blanks are to be used mostly in DVD camcorders from Panasonic, Sony and Hitachi. I use them in my beloved Panasonic VDR-D300 3CCD DVD camcorder (see my review of the camcorder on Amazon). These DVD-R blanks are pre-formatted so all I need to do is pop one into my Panasonic and start shooting. I shoot at the highest quality setting (called XP" on the Panasonic) which gives me about 18 minutes of recording time. After I'm done with one disk, I finalize it on the Panasonic which makes it playable in all DVD players as well as most computer DVD-ROM drives. (The only DVD drives not compatible with 8 cm discs are those that suck the disc in. These small discs must be used in tray-loading or cartridge-loading drives. Very few people, other than some Apple computer owners, have those sucking drives.)The TDK discs, manufactured by a Taiwanese company for TDK, are quite reliable. I've gone through two dozen and have not encoutnered any problems. The only unknown is shelf life of these discs. I make backup copies of my videos both on hard drives and on a regular DVD-R. Because your own home video recordings are not encrypted, you can simply copy the files on the TDK disc to a blank regular-sized DVD-R via Windows Explorer. It's really simple.Of course, since these are R discs, they can be used only once. If you want a rewritable RW blank, check out the TDK Camcorder DVD-RW 3-pack."
When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.Storage - This is the new 1 GB version of the iPod Nano. Apple released the 1 GB version, to have an entry-level nano priced at only $150. You get all the features of the 2 & 4 GB models, but simply less storage for songs. If having less songs to carry around is ok with you, save some money with this player.Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.
I bought the RD2840 40GB Lyra jukebox when it first went out sale as exclusive at Circuit City. I've been quite happy with it.Pros: huge capacity (Windows reports 37.2GB total); low price; USB 2.0 High-Speed (=fast transfers!); drag-and-drop file transfers for both music and non-music; recognized by Windows as an external hard disk; graphic EQ plus a few presets; iPod-like interface; includes carrying case and car adapter; backlit LCD screen with adjustable backlight and contrast; good sound quality (after you replace the stock headphones); easy system software set-up (no reboot needed in XP); key lock via Menu button; line-out for hi-fi systems; ability to tag a song &quot;Like&quot; or &quot;Dislike&quot;; ability to import MusicMatch play lists; cute packaging box with handle.Cons: bulky (but surprisingly lighter than I'd expected); too thick; buttons can be unresponsive at times; cannot remember last song played after power down (really stupid! Who designed this thing?); quality seems ok but not as solid-feel as electronics from Sony or other Japanese brands; not much of a printed manual; web support almost non-existent (although you can download the latest firmware update).Overall I like the RD2840, a lot. I had iPod-envy but not any more. Sure it's bulkier and heavier than the iPod, but it's not really too heavy at under 10 oz., and comes with a decent carrying case, plus the value factor is just enormous. I'm not rich by any measure so I couldn't justify shelling out the iPod kind of money. Also, I wanted to use whatever jukebox I'd buy as an external hard drive, and the RCA products are the only ones that can function this way. (Nope, even the new Creative Labs Nomad NX can't double as an external drive. Besides, that product has a really brain-dead desktop program, and its internal drive breaks when you just walk. Avoid the Nomad NX!)Software installation was fast and required no restart, a rarity these days. I skipped installing MusicMatch, since I encode mostly in WMA using Windows Media Player. With native drag-and-drop support via USB 2.0 High-Speed, it's so easy and fast to transfer all sorts of files between your PC and the RD2840. You can use the RD2840 as a back-up hard disk. What happens is after you transfer the files, you *must* do a profiling via the system tray. This is VERY IMPORTANT to keep the RD2840 happy. The profiling process is actually quite fast if you do it after you transfer the files, before you unplug it from the PC. (You can also do it from the RD2840 itself, but it takes longer and consumes battery power.) The profiling basically recognizes all the MP3, MP3Pro and WMA files on the RD2840's hard disk and builds a database. If you don't profile each time after you transfer files, you get unpredictable behavior, which eventually will require a soft reset. (Yep, it has a reset whole, on the left side.)The player supports all MP3 tags, and the blue blacklit LCD screen shows you all the information about each music file. WMA support is flawless. (I don't have any MP3Pro files so I don't know how that works.) I encode all my music in bitrates from 64 kbps (for WMA) up to 192 kbps (for MP3), and the first time I set up the player, I transfered about 2GB of songs. The transfer process took about 5 minutes (I have USB 2.0 High-Speed ports on my laptop), and the profiling took less than a minute. I also copied some documents just to confirm that I could use the RD2840 as an external drive; again the transfer was fast over USB 2.0 High-Speed.So that was tip #1: always profile the RD2840 after downloading files to it. Tip #2 is, be sure to download the latest firmware from RCA's website. There's some confusion as to whether the current update actually does anything for this particular model. You should still download and install it anyway.Tip #3, to maximize battery life, you should always top off the charge by an hour or so. That's just the way LiIon batteries work. If you don't charge it fully, over time its performance will degrade. RCA says you can get 10 hours of play time out of this; I guess the actual battery life depends on how often you press the buttons, the encoding format and rate of your music, and other factors. I found that I get anywhere between 6 and 8 hours, more on the low end, though. Luckily, the AC adpater is pretty compact, and you get a car adapter in the package.The biggest annoyance is that the player can't remember where you were before you shut it off. That's really stupid. On the other hand, the scroll button would scroll slowly first, but if you keep holding it down for 2 seconds, it starts scrolling by page, pausing a bit between pages, which is really nice. The overall interface reminds me of the iPod's, although slightly less refined, but still usable even if you don't read the electronic manual.In summary, the RD2840 is a very capable MP3/WMA jukebox player as well as an external hard drive for Windows PCs. Mac support is rather limited, but Windows users will be happy especially if they heed my aforementioned suggestions.
Measuring at an incredibly small 0.8 x 1.0 x 0.07 inches, xD picture cards are a new flash storage format jointly developed by Fuji and Olympus, the two largest manufacturers of digital cameras in the world, as a futuristic successor to the SmartMedia card. The xD cards are actually manufactured by Toshiba, known for its promotion of the competing Secure Digital (SD) flash storage format, and are about 1/3 the size of a SmartMedia card and slightly smaller than SD and MMC cards. (Confused by the alphabet soup yet?)Sidebar: xD stands for extreme digital"But smallness does not mean lameness. Fuji and Olympus promise very high read/write speeds (3MB/sec for writes and 5MB/sec for reads) as well as lower power consumption for the xD cards. They also claim that eventually xD's capacity will reach 8GB (!!!), although no timetable has been set. Right now xD cards come in 32MB, 64MB, 128MB and 256MB flavors, and generally cost 50% more than same-capacity SD cards, but their prices are likely to drop quickly as more digital cameras accept the format.Which brings us to the critical question, how many digital cameras accept xD cards? Not many at this point, and digital cameras that accept SmartMedia cannot use xD. But given the market clout of Olympus and Fuji, we'll surely see more xD-friendly models soon. The question is whether other camera producers (Canon, Nikon, Kodak, Toshiba...) will also adopt the technology. My prediction is since Canon has made a commitment to continued use of CompactFlash, they are unlikely to go with the xD. Toshiba manufactures xD cards for Fuji and Olympus, so they may adopt it if they see serious commitment by the latter two.Since so far few cameras use the xD format, there is little real-world comparison between xD and competing formats such as SD and Sony's MemoryStick/MemoryStick PRO. Whether you'll need xD is entirely dependent on whether the digital camera you choose will accept it. My advice is pick a digital camera without regard to the storage format it takes, because all the formats out there -- SD, MMC, SM, CF, MS, and now xD -- get the job done."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Fuji 64MB SmartMedia Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

This budget LCD monitor is a good choice for home and SOHO users. It's stylish in black, and the LCD panel gives good image clarity and color reproduction. Minor gripes I have are first the contrast ratio could be higher (but that can be said of every LCD I've seen) and second the menu system is harder than it should be. But this ranks top in departments that matter the most in a monitor: image quality. Also, I've had various NEC's in the past and their durability is nothing short of top-notch.
This marvelous mini drive is my new best friend. Simpletech's 128 MB Bonzai drive is powerpacked. It's fast(1.5 MB/s) and easy to transfer large files like Powerpoint presentations between notebook and desktop, even between Windows and Mac without any drivers! It fits in your pocket and connects to any USB port without any cables or adapters. It's extremely easy to use and even upgradable. I wish I would of had one years ago.
Sony's new T-series VAIO ultraportable laptops replace the camera-included TR series, which has been discontinued. There are currently four models in the T-series: T140, T150, T160, and T170. All sport the same casing (no surprise), same weight (3.1 lb. incl. piggy-back battery but excl. AC adapter), same processor (the new Intel ultra-low-voltage Pentium M 733 (based on the Centrino, not Pentium IV, running at 1.1Ghz but with an amazing 2MB level-2 cache!), same screen, and same hard drive (slow-ish 4800rpm 40GB shock resistant drive).The differences among the models are as follows:- The 140 and 160 come with a DVD-ROM/CD-RW drive, so you can't burn DVDs.- The 150 and 170 come with dual-format DVD burner/CD-RW drive, so you can burn both the plus and minus formats of DVDs.- The 140 and 150 come with 512MB of RAM.- The 160 and 170 come with 1GB of RAM (max the T-series can take).- If there's a P" after the model number (e.g., VGN-T150P/L), it means the computer comes with WinXP Professional installed. The absence of "P" means you get WinXP Home.- The "L" after the model number signifies the color scheme. Most of the T's come in what Sony calls "midnight blue," a stylish color that gives an understated emphasis to the exterior. On Sony's website (sonystyle.com) you can special-order a T150P/T that has a burgundy exterior, which looks really "hot."All the T-series VAIOs are designed with two primary goals in mind: ultra portability, reflected mainly in the travel weight; and multimedia capabilities. In fact, VAIO buffs will recall that VAIO stands for Video Audio Integrated Operation, which (I presume) in Japanese means a multimedia-centric computer.All the T models are equipped with an optical drive. Only a year ago, the only ultraportable with a built-in optical drive was the 2.8lb. Panasonic ToughBook W2 (which, as you'll see, is still my favorite ultraportable, for lighter weight and bigger screen). I personally recommend a 150 or 170 with the dual-format (not dual-layer) DVD burner. These days, whether you burn personal videos or backup files, a DVD burner really comes in handy. Of course, if you plan to use the VAIO T as a secondary computer for Starbucks or Barnes & Noble or flying, you can save yourself $150 by skipping the DVD burner. (You still get a CD burner with the 140 and 160.)The VAIO T's are very stylish. Except for the protruding battery which seems like an afterthought, the notebook is well designed and well built. You get both 802.11b+g wi-fi and Bluetooth built-in, as well as an i.Link port and a MemoryStick slot. (Too bad Sony still refuses to support the much more popular Secure Digital format in their laptops.)The T's screen is amazing. Well, it's both amazingly small (only 10.6" vs. the Panasonic W2's 12.1") and amazingly bright, easily viewable outdoors. The widescreen resolution is 1280x768, great for watching DVDs but a pain in the eye for doing your everyday work. (You may want to turn on Windows' built-in font-magnification function, via the Accessibility control panel. Also turn off font smoothing.) I get eye strains from reading e-mails and surfing the Internet. Panasonic W2's 12.1" screen seems so much bigger. Like most ultraportables, the T uses shared memory for video, so don't expect to play Doom 3 on this.The keyboard on the T is shrunk to accommodate the small footprint of the ultraportable. I had the 2.7lb. VAIO N505VE before so I got used to the small keyboard quickly. If you are a touch typist who's never used a 90%-sized keyboard, you might be unhappy with the size, at least in the beginning.Performance is snappy on this laptop despite the many plug-ins it comes with; the new processor with its enormous L2 cache and the generous amount of RAM surely help. When you get the 1GB versions, the performance is simply great for a laptop this size.Sony should be lauded for getting some amazing battery life on this machine, but spanked for making the battery stick out in the T's rear. I watched a 3-hour DVD movie (with wi-fi intentionally left on) as I sat in a B&N; cafe. After the boring movie ended, the T still had plenty of juice left. Just amazing.So, in short, for about two thousand big ones, you get a multimedia road warrior that will turn heads in cafes and on the Amtrak (and might even invite a mugging or two if you are in the wrong neighborhood). The small screen is amazingly bright, and the stick of a battery powers this laptop for good hours. If you want an ultraportable, I still recommend you look at the Panasonic W-2, which is even more stylish (I just love its circular, under-the-keyboard DVD loading), has a bigger screen and weighs less. But if you want an ultraportable with a built-in DVD burner, the T is probably the best you can get right now.(I also like Fujitsu laptops, so you might want to consider the Fujitsu Lifebook P7010 ultraportable as well: cheaper, 80GB hard drive, fingerprint sensor, SD/CF/MemoryStick slot, up to 10.5 hours of battery life!)I hope my quick review helps you. Feel free to e-mail me at hotmail with your questions."
Maxell manufactures excellent 120 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and just about anything else. These tapes have 120 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 60 blank minutes for recording on each side. This is useful when recording one hour radio talk shows, for example.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.There is one disappointment; however. These tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Moreover, cassette tapes--especially the 120 minute kind with its thinner than usual tape--can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you decide to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a superior choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for years and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell 120 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.
My rating is based on the fact that I have been using a Jetprinter Z55 printer for 2 years long. During this time I have used a variety of after market ink cartridges as well as self fill cartridges for printing photos or documents. None of these provided the print quality as this cartridge form Eforcity. As such, I would like to only buy ink cartridge form Eforcity.

I saved a ton of money with these cartridges, and the quality was still there.
I just recently chose to take a position at OneCall_com but previously I was working at Targus so I know a few things about backpack construction, and I can tell you this is one heck of a nice backpack. It is rugged in construction, has useful pockets and multiple zippered compartments. I honestly store not only my Digital Rebel XT in the backpack but my Sony HD Camcorder as well. I put the blank MiniDV tapes in one zippered compartment, the unused MiniDV tapes in another compartment, the Digital Rebel XT spare batteries in one of the elastic netting compartments inside of a zippered pouched, extra lense in the main compartment with the camcorder down the middle and the camera laying across the top (I take the external flash off).I begged Targus to come up with a really good professional level digital camera carry case solution but as of the time I left, they still weren't offering one. ;-(Good work Canon!!
When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer. The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world. In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini. Why? They had something better: the iPod Nano.Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, impossibly small," and "magic." While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.Reliability - Are you worried that such a small and light music player is unreliable? Don't be! The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit.Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs. The 2-gigabyte model is available for $50 less, but a 2x increase in storage capacity makes this 4-gigabyte model, the best value.Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around.Color - White is the traditional iPod color, but this black iPod nano is proving to be incredibly popular. Just note that the black is more likely to show scratches and fingerprints.Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason."

When entering the world of macro photography you need to select a closeup flash because the units mounted on the hot shoe or the built in flash are shadowed by the lens. The SRF-11 is the more powerful of the two units but the STF-22 gives you more precise control as to where the light goes. Either way, you only need to buy the S" version once because that includes the FC-01 flash controller which doubles as a ring light and twin flash controller. After that, you can add the other flashes if needed.For example, a TF-22 package includes everything necessary except the FC-01 controller (and contrary to the amazon writeup it DOES include the SR-1 ring) If you own the 11-22 mm lens, the TF-22 is the only macro flash able to run with your lens because it threads into the filter (72mm) on the 11-22 mm lens. The RF-11 uses the bayonet lugs to mount the glare shields and does not thread into the filter system.The TF-22 can be mounted to the end of the lens, or each flash can be mounted to a small tripod. The TF-22 has a setting to adjust the amount of light balance between the two flashes.If you never buy the TF-22, you will have all the parts needed to operate the RF-11 because you purchased the SRF-11 package. If you want twin flash to start, order the STF-22 package.You can also buy the FC-01 controller separately, however it is the most expensive way to get the unit. Buying a package deal to start and then adding other flahses is a much better bargain."
I do alot of work with XLR and have my xlr&lt;>RCA male cables for dealing with single ended sources. None of the cables however are made with a female RCA on the rca side, so I ordered a set of these to go with the cables - they were half price on the amazon gold box sale so a good overall value.Now combined with my XLR &lt;> RCA(M) cables I also get XLR &lt;> RCA (F) as well, which I've found helpful with pre-cabled devices that have a RCA (M) output only and the cable is attached.It's a good gadget to have in your cable and adapter bag, but the higher price now makes it a lesser value, though the quality is still exceptional and I still recommend you get a good set of rca professional connectors to avoid scratchy audio. These fit the bill just fine.

TDK manufactures excellent six hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have six hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording television shows, for example.In addition, you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time, four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording. (You use your VCR to set this.) The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they're satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of viewing enjoyment because you record onto them over and over again countless times although after some use the picture quality will eventually begin to gradually deteriorate.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a DVD-R onto another DVD-R instead of a TDK blank VHS tape, the quality of the audio-visual media on the DVD-R copy would be sharper and clearer than a TDK tape or any other brand of video tape could give you. Moreover, VHS tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow front edge of each VHS tape which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The VHS tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable blank VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record. I have used this brand for many years and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK premium quality six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape.
You can not evaluate the lens by just the numbers - yes, it is nearly identical to the factory lens, but it is a much faster lens and made in Japan, not China. Additionally it has a unique focus system that requires very little lens movement to go from 3 feet to infinity - this translates into RAPID focus - faster than the factory lens as well. It also features the mounting lugs and 62mm (as opposed to 58) filter threads to accept the ring flash as well as the twin flash accessories, so if you have expanded beyond the FL-50 - you DON'T want the factory lens any more. Taken together, this is the lens 70-80% of my shooting was done with. I am sold on the E300 and bought 3 backs cheap after they were obsoleted - I also bought 3 lenses, the 14-54, the 50mm macro, and the 50-200mm - each lens is on its own back eliminating the risk of contamination completely while giving me redundancy when I am away.After knowing you are going to take a picture, you narrow down to 2 questions as to which one.1 - you don't know much except you have a picture to take - use the 14-542 - you know it's going to be about 50mm and you want maximum detail or have poor lighting, or have a macro shot - then pick the 50 mm prime lens3 - it's a long distance shot - take the 50-200, add the teleconverter if needed.Simple!And for flash - long distances get the FL-50 - shorter get the ring or twin flash to even the lighting out. Forgot your flash? pop up the built in one!
The HP 21 inkjet cartridge is very light, easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality, durable black ink on the page. It stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (It even comes with an expiration date!) HP also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit.One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the ink can go quickly. If you print a lot, you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. My needs are about 10 pages per week and I have to change the cartridge roughly every six to seven weeks. That's not good; although to be fair to this HP ink cartridge I am printing graphics.As of the time that I am writing this, why don't we get a better discount for buying two cartridges? I notice the price to buy two is just slightly less than twice the cost of one of these HP 21 ink cartridges--but buying two should be cheaper still since you're buying two and not just one at a time; instead HP wants their customers to pay twice without giving them any discount or price improvement." You might save a little over a dollar by buying this twinpack; but that's not much. There's just no discount nor is there any financial incentive to buy more than one at a time--and, as one reviewer notes, this is a disappointment.Three and one-half stars for being great ink in easy to manage and install cartridges. It loses one and one-half stars for not lasting longer AND not giving customers a discount for buying more than one cartridge at a time."
Amazing. 1GB of DDR2 PC2-4200 costs $180 at Best Buy, Staples, etc. Even on sale they cost almost $80 or $90, and those stores carry no-name brands. Crucial is made by Micron so the memory quality is great. I bought this for my Dell Dimension 8400 after the Samsung RAM it came with burned out after just 13 months (right after the one-year warranty went out!). Given my past experience with Crucial RAM, I have no doubt that this will last a long time.Note: PCs that use DDR2 RAM almost always require the RAM be intalled in pairs, so be sure to get 2 or 4 each time. This kit has 2 512MB modules.
The Komodo series has a few variations, but all employ high-quality LCD panels. The X9g-Komodo II (X9=19 diagonal, II=variation II of the Komodo serise) has a very nice panel (possibly made by Fujitsu) that's capable of 1280x1024 resolution and 16.7 million colors. The backlighting is very even, and at the max setting (25), too bright for most settings. I set it at 13, with contrast around 15 (out of 25), and it still looks bright in my office. No dead pixels on my unit.Not all the Komodo models have the digital DVI connector. If you need DVI, be sure to get the right variation.In summary, like other Sceptre offerings, the X9g-Komodo offers excellent image quality for a low price that's hard to beat. Very highly recommended."
Apple's iMac line of desktop computers are always some of the most colorful, beautiful, and respected machines in the industry. In October 2005, Apple updated the iMac G5 making them better than ever.You'll be impressed with the iMac G5, from the very moment you begin opening the box. It is beautifully and carefully packaged, and you're greeted by a message inside saying Designed by Apple in California." Then it is time to experience the performance of Apple's fastest consumer-level machine ever...Faster - The new iMac sports faster processors. This 20-inch model now has a 2.1 GHZ Power PC G5 processor, which is up, from 2.0 GHZ, on the previous 20-inch model. Furthermore, the system's architecture is now faster, with the iMac G5 using DDR 2 memory. The iMac includes 512 MB of DDR 2 memory, and it can be upgraded, to a maximum of 2.5 GB of memory.In terms of speed, I was immediately impressed. Applications pop open almost immediately, things snap to the screen, its responsive, and even intensive encoding tasks are handled efficiently.Front Row Experience - Apple has included a new software title that at this time is only available on the iMac G5. Front Row. Front Row comes with your iMac, and a remote control is also included. Front row allows you to watch and listen to media items, on your computer, from across the room. Click one button on the remote, and bring up Front Row, for quick access to your music, movies, podcasts, DVD, and more.Front row is without question the best way to access media files, on a personal computer. It blew me away, with its graphics, sound, and the overall experience it creates. Turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and bring up Front Row. Your friends' jaws will drop!Built in iSight - The new iMac includes a built in iSight camera, so you can video conference with friends right out of the box. Furthermore, with the built in isight you can take advantage of another new application, available only on this imac right now, called Photobooth. Photobooth allows you to snap photos of yourself or friends, from the built-in camera and add wild effects.Appearance - The new iMac G5 is thinner than the previous model making it more beautiful than ever. This machine will stand out on your desk.Display - The iMac 20-inch features a widescreen display, which is great for watching movies and fitting items such as wide spreadsheets, or media projects, onto the screen. You can also squeeze several applications into view, making yourself more productive. The resolution is 1650x1050, and the specifications on the display in this iMac now exceed the specifications on Apple's professional 20-inch cinema display.Hard Drive - The iMac G5 20-inch includes a big 250 gigabyte hard drive, which will allow you to store thousands of songs, pictures, and hundreds of hours of video.Mac OS X - If you're considering Macintosh for the first time, you're going to love the Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger. It is incredibly user friendly, and you'll quickly find the interface and design is saving you time. Furthermore, Mac OS X is much more secure than Windows, so you can put your mind at rest.iLife - Apple still includes iLife with every Mac. iLife is a great way to manage your personal digital life. Store and manage your digital images in iPhoto, jam to music in iTunes, create music in Garageband, and create simple movies in iMovie.Furthermore, there are convenient applications built right into the operating system such as Dashboard, iCal (a great calendar that syncs up with your external devices including iPod), Dictionary, Expose, Stickies, DVD Player, and more.Wireless - Your iMac will come standard, with an Airport Extreme card, for wireless networking. Furthermore, a bluetooth module is included, allowing you to use wireless devices, such as keyboards and mice, plus sync devices such as a mobile phone.Value - You will not find many computers available today that delivers what this iMac has at such an affordable price. A fast processor, beautiful 20-inch widescreen display, wonderfully designed computer case, big hard drive, double layer DVD burner, fantastic software, and a lot more. Amazon makes it even more affordable, with great rebates.Overall, I am truly impressed by the new iMac G5. In fact, it may be one of Apple's most impressive releases, in the past couple years. The iMac delivers high end consumer performance, with features that should meet your toughest expectations. There is simply not much that cannot be done with this very capable computer. Enjoy the new iMac G5. It's a great machine."
In NW-HD3, Sony finally added native MP3 support to its tiny hard disk-based digital music player, so no conversion to its proprietary ATRAC3 format is necessary. This makes the player much more attractive to users already with a large collection of MP3 files. Styling-wise, this new player comes in five color choices: red, pink (looks purplish to me), blue, black, and silver. Backlighting color is also different depending on the exterior color. Plenty of eye candy, for sure. (FYI, mine is red.)Internally, other than the added support for MP3, the HD3 is exactly the same as the HD1. In fact, even the dimensions and weight (4.5 oz.) are the same. It's also the same 1.8 20GB hard drive inside. It has the same SUPERB sound quality as the HD1. (Seriously, before listening to ATRAC3 on the HD1, I hadn't known compressed music could sound so good.) Both models claim up to 30 hours of battery life when playing back ATRAC3Plus files. (On my HD1, I routinely got over 25 hours of playback on a single charge.) For MP3, Sony claims "up to 20 hours." As I write this, I've been playing a mixture of 128kbps and 192kbps MP3 files for about eight hours on my last recharge and the battery is at the half mark. Of course, ifyou turn on the equalizer, choose shuffle (random) play, or press the buttons a lot, the battery will run down faster. (Hard drive spinning and backlighting consume the most power.)BTW, the LiIon battery in the HD3 *can* be user-replaced in theory; see p.39 of the manual. The only question is where can you and I get a spare battery. I wouldn't buy a generic battery on ebay because 1) there are reports that these "fake" batteries don't work, and 2) if improperly charged, they can explode, just like with the exploding cell phones. Like the HD1, the HD3 has just a few buttons. The menu and mode buttons on the top seem easier to press than the HD1, which is a welcome improvement. The play/stop button is still a bit too small for my big thumbs. The four-way arrow buttons are responsive and I personally prefer a simple linear control scheme like this over other "weird" interfaces such as scroll wheel or touch-sensitive strip. I also like the hold button on this thing; it's very easy to slide. Backlighting on the HD3 works well and the monochrome LCD is small but sharp.Some nice touches of the HD3 include the ability to choose "line out" instead of "headphones" when you want to run the output through an amplifier. ("Headphones" output is pre-amped and will sound distorted and harsh if it goes into an external amplifier.) There're also a six-band equalizer and virtual surround sound settings.Overall, the HD3 feels very solid physically and the player itself is pretty easy to figure out. Most audiophiles will like the superb sound quality they'll get if they rip into the ATRAC3Plus format. I've used this player in the gym, and it never skips a beat.Now, the not-so-pleasant side of this little wonder...Even though HD3 is a HUGE improvement over its predecessor HD1 due to the native MP3 playback capability alone (well, a lower introductory price is also a big plus), its user interface and music transfer interface haven't been improved at all. The updated SonicStage software (now at version 2.3) is fine some of the time, but a nightmare other times. There are a number of nagging issues:1) You cannot simply copy your MP3 files to the HD3 and expect to play them later. The HD3 does appear on Windows desktop as an external drive, and you can copy any files (including MP3 files) to its hard drive. Basically this allows you to use the HD3 as an external disk drive. But, in order for the MP3 files to play back as audio, they must be transferred using the included SonicStage music management software. (Internally, SonicStage places all transferred music tracks, MP3 or ATRAC, in a proprietary database on the HD3. You cannot access these tracks directly from Windows Explorer.)2) While you can charge the HD3 using the USB cable via the small USB adapter (it doesn't have a docking cradle a la the HD1), which is a cool thing, you cannot transfer music without plugging in the AC adapter. This is just plain stupid and it means if you want to transfer music on other PCs, you must carry the AC adapter with you. The AC adapter is small and one-piece, but it's still a pain to have to remember carrying it with you.3) You still must "authorize" the HD3 with the Sony Connect music service. This is pretty straightforward -- when it works. The whole music rights control system Sony forces upon us is so freaking convoluted and stupid and irksome. To the dumbheads at Sony marketing: we users want a simpler way to manage and transfer music! Even Windows Media Player 10 is way better at these than SonicStage 2.3.4) You cannot rate music like you can in Windows Media Player. Creating playlists (called "groups" by Sony in the HD3 manual but known as "albums" in SonicStage -- go figure!) in SonicStage is a bit of a pain. You cannot create playlists on the HD3 itself. It only has a feature called Bookmark which basically combines ratings and a rudimentary playlist into one function. You can bookmark up to 100 songs.5) Shuffle (random) and repeat plays are ridiculously complicated and require lots of button presses; and you cannot activate them when a song is playing! Take a look at pp.25-28 of the manual and be prepared for an anxiety attack. Once again, Sony introduces some totally stupefying concept to make their American users' playback experience miserable: this time it's something calld "play unit" which involves where you start playback. Anyway, it just makes no sense whatsoever. In a nutshell, it's almost impossible to get consistent shuffle plays on the HD3. Sometimes it shuffles the entire collection of your music, other times it does just a folder or artist. Totally bewildering.6) Native WMA playback is still not supported. You can convert non-copy-protected WMA files into ATRAC using SonicStage, a time-consuming process. If you have WMA tracks bought from an online store (MSN Music, Walmart, Musicmatch, etc.), you cannot convert them.7) Sony just has to come up with a better name than "Network Walkman NW-HD3." And you call that POS a case???In short, like the earlier HD1, the HD3 is an amazing piece of hardware with terrific sound quality, amazing battery life and a solid feel (but not heavy in weight) not found on any other MP3 player. If only Sony would improve the player's interface as well as the scary SonicStage software (esp. in the copy protection department), this would simply be the best MP3 player, period."But," you ask, "is the NW-HD3 right for me?"The answer depends on what you want. If you want great sound quality *and* the best hardware form factor, the HD3 is your top choice. If you can, rip to ATRAC3Plus for top-notch sound quality and prolonged battery life. If you want a tiny yet solid MP3 jukebox and don't mind studying the electronic manual (in PDF), the HD3 is also a good choice, and you get long battery life as a bonus. If you prefer linear scrolling (like I do) to alternative methods, you'll like the HD3's simply four-way controls. If, however, your cup of tea is simplicity (esp. on the desktop software side) over sound quality, you'll be better off with an iPod; if you want something with lots of bells and whistles (FM, recording, calendar, etc.), you'll be happier with something from Creative Labs.Here are a few tips that I hope will help smooth your HD3 experience:1) You must use the version of SonicStage on the HD3's CD-ROM (v2.3, but somehow more "special" than the updater you can download on Sony's website). If you have any older version installed, be sure to uninstall it first. Reboot, then install the new version.2) If you run into any problems with transferring music -- and many users do sooner or later -- call the Sony Connect/SonicStage's toll-free support number. They are much, much better and more competent than the hardware support people, who are clueless and useless on anything other than which button you should press to play music. E-mail me if you want that phone number. (It's on Connect's website but a bit hard to find.)3) Don't bother with getting a remote control. The two that are Japan-only but can be special-ordered are just way over-priced for the simple functions they have. There's been consistent talk in user forums that Sony will probably introduce one of the remotes here, in which case it'll certainly be much cheaper than what you'll pay right now. But if you really *need* a remote, e-mail me and I can tell you which one you should get (and which one to avoid) and which legit source to get it from."
I posted a photo above you can look at to see the objective glass element on this lens - it has some severe curvature to obtain the near 90 degreee field of view without distortion. I also plan to mount it in my linearity tester when finished using it for a customer and will post a photo of its overall resolution.This lens would be IDEAL for a realator who takes curb apeal" shots of homes, and interior shots where it is difficult to see floor to ceiling and wall to wall. At 11 MM there is no fisheye effect and all lines are straight. Unfortunately, even though this can focus down to about 11 inches, it can not mount the flash ring because it has a 72mm filter size instead of the 67 mm on the other lenses which can use the ring flash. This is really a shame too, because at close distances, the wide field of view of this lens will cast a shadow from the built in flash on the camera that may take up 1/8 of the picture. Using a flash off the camera for closeup work is one option, a bounce flash and a card is another option, but direct lighting will alsmost certainly show up in the picture due to the wide viewing angle.Outside during daylight the lens really shines. I used it to take a photo of my house from the curb and got the entire lot (75' wide) from 50 feet away on the sidewalk, with the grass in front in focus, as well as the sky above, and parts of my neighbor's homes. This would give a realator alot of flexibility to either zoom in or crop the picture in photoshop for a front on view for flyers."
Mad Dog External 52X CD-RWThis external CD-RW drive connects to any computer that has a USB port. The program supports Windows versions 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, and XP. [There is no support for USB ports in native Windows 95.] This 52X CD-RW is treated like any USB Mass Storage Device.The first steps in the guide explain how to connect the power cord and the USB cable. Turning the power switch on allows the Operating System to recognize the drive. [As with a printer.] If the OS asks for USB Mass Storage Devices" you must install the USB 2.0 driver CD in the internal CD reader. Double click on the "Setup" file, then follow the instructions to complete the driver installation. There is an Unofficial Win98 upgrade that will support USB Mass Storage Devices like a memory stick or an Iomega ZIP drive. If you have done this there is no need to to install the USB 2.0 driver CD.Then install the supplied "Nero Burning Software" CD and follow the on-screen prompts and instructions. You can then run the Nero program to create or update a CD. You should choose the multi-session option when making a copy of your data files to allow future additions or deletions of files; unless you want an archival copy that can't be modified. Nero uses a "drag and drop" method, or you can highlight the folder and file names and choose the "Add" function. When done, choose the "Burn" function to perform the operation. You might choose the options that test the speed and perform a simulation before burning the folders and files to the CD. Then exit the program.This unit is very practical when you have more than one computer and don't want or need a CD-RW drive for each computer, or for space considerations."
Wow. iPod. How did we listen to music before it? This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats. MP3, AAC, etc. The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection. It allows fast and easy navigation. The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read. The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind. Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.I use my iPod all the time. You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.The problem with my iPod. The first one I received skipped songs randomly. I had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me. I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved. However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now. Thank you Apple! You make fabulous products. The product I rate five stars, but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow. However, you should still buy an iPod! The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed. Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem. I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.iPod will change the way you enjoy music!
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Kingston 64MB CompactFlash CARD, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
The F30 is an evolutionary step-up in terms of low-light performance from the F10, which was the first ultra-compact camera to give high-quality high-ISO pictures. The F30 is about the same size as its predecessor but actually looks and feels smaller, thanks to its restyling. However, I found the F10 much easier to hold and operate.In terms of ISO performance, the F30 is about the same ISO-for-ISO as the F10, but adds a ISO 3200 setting. To be honest, pictures taken at ISO 3200 are barely usable beyond web or e-mail, i.e., an ISO 3200 won't make even a good 6x4" print. But it's there if you do need it, and I have used it on quite a number of low-light conditions. In the end, I think it's a good thing to have, because memories, even captured with a lot of digital noise, can be too precious to not record.The F30 simplifies the user interface of the F10 but I find it harder to use than the F10. If you are not an upgrader from the F10 like me, since shouldn't be a problem. The buttons are smaller than on the F10 but still usable even by someone like myself with big hands. One welcome improvement is the F30 now uses a standard mini-USB cable, as opposed to the special-connector dongle the F10 had. You still need that Fuji cable, though, unless you use a separate USB reader and take out the xD card each time you download to PC (which is what I do).In regular ISO pictures, quality is very good but not yet top-notch. In other words, you get good-quality, pleasing pictures but you should know that Canon cameras probably still give you slightly better pictures at the low ISOs. But, alas, this is a totally subjective opinion, so don't take my words for it. You should judge the picture quality yourself. Even I'd have preferred Canon's image quality at ISO 100 and 200, I still value Fuji's low-ISO performance, enough to upgrade to the F30 instead of buying a Canon.The F30 is fast. I think it's a hair faster (i.e., less shutter delay) than the F10. The built-in LCD, also at 2.5" diagonal, has twice as many pixels as the F10 but the post-shot preview can look coarse. The camera is now made in China (as opposed to Japan for the F10) but is quite well constructed.One amazing thing about the F10 was its amazing battery life. The F30 is even better! I've taken over 600 high-resolution pictures with hours and hours of VGA video on my F30 in the 3 months I've had it, and the battery status indicator still has two out of three bars remaining! This is just amazing! I used to have a Casio that had long battery life, but the F10 and now F30 are just way better when it comes to battery life.So there were two reasons I chose the F10 and then upgraded to the F30, instead of getting a Canon or a Panasonic (which has great zoom and optical stabilization features). One, the good low-ISO performance. Two, Fujifilm supports the panda preservation program at the National Zoo in D.C., and I'm a big sucker for those black-and-white bears, so I support Fujifilm. But when it comes to technical details, I'm totally unbiased, so you can trust my reviews.Feel free to contact me with questions."

This Walkman by Sony offers serious music lovers the opportunity to listen to MP3 files stored on a CD, a regular CD (of course); AM and FM radio and seven TV stations. It even sports a weather digital tuner! The remote comes in handy if you don't want to carry the actual player in your hands as you walk about town. Moreover, it only uses a single AA battery at a time and you get lots of play time out of that single battery. Even better still, this portable CD player weighs in at only one pound--this very lightweight machine poses no hindrance if you use it as you walk through the streets. Great!At first glance the controls on the Walkman itself appear intimidating but after about ten minutes tops you learn all the important and most commonly used functions. The controls also make it easy to adjust the levels of bass and change equalizer settings. Other functions, including listening to a TV station, require more concentration and time to learn. However, the instruction manual is fairly clear and if you have questions you can always contact Sony customer support by phone or Internet.The product description on this page indicates that software for making ATRAC" CDs comes packaged with this player. However, when I bought this just last week there was no such bundled software. Instead, the product manual indicates that I need to download the relevant software from the Sony website. However, there remains no extra charge to download the relevant software to make an "ATRAC" CD. The advantage of making an "ATRAC" CD is that you can fit much, much more music onto an "ATRAC" CD than you ever could otherwise when making your own CDs. Indeed, the owner's manual for this Walkman states that you can fit about 30 CDs' worth of sound onto one "ATRAC" CD. Excellent!However, I noticed some disappointments. First, Sony advertises this Walkman as being for the music enthusiast--and they are right. This means that the average layperson like me will have to spend a couple of hours learning how to use ALL the functions of this Walkman. The capabilities of this little machine impress me greatly; but there will be a learning curve for persons like myself. I did not anticipate that. In addition, the buttons are rather small so you need to be careful of how you touch them with your fingers. Finally, the earbuds hurt my ears almost from the very start of listening to a CD on this Walkman. I strongly suggest you purchase a better quality headset or earphones that will be more comfortable.Overall, music enthusiasts will be thrilled with this Walkman. The abundant features amaze me and I believe you will be impressed, too. The quality of the sound is excellent; you can even make the sound constant at a certain level at which the product manual indicates that you won't hurt your hearing as you listen to music or talk on this CD. The shockproof memory and "skip-free G protection" impress me, too. I highly recommend this portable CD player for music lovers everywhere. In addition, if you have the time to learn how to use this machine to its greatest potential, any layperson like me will also come to cherish this Walkman."
CD-Rs are a much needed thing for me. Even if I still have my music on an iPod, I still have a lot of documents in my computer. I definitely have a big enough hard drive to store all of my weird documents and online-schooling and such. But sometimes I have to go to the library or use a different computer or so on. I prefer using CD-Rs rather than a jumpdrive because they are easy to forget and don't store a very large amount--which I believe it should for the price you are paying for those things. CD-Rs are less costly and I don't need many, just a few that basically just work". And these Sony CD-Rs do just that!Whenever I'm shopping for CD-Rs I look to see what is most inexpensive from a reliable brand. I have had most luck from CD-Rs from Sony, Maxell, and Philips--all three which are decent manufacturers. TDK's never seem to burn at the speed they advertise. Imation's just seem to be coasters. And on Memorex CD-Rs the paint always seem to chip off just months after use. So I try searching for those three brands. And almost everytime Sony's are always on sale way below the list price. I don't really need jewel cases either since I have no desire to keep my old documents--at least those that date back months ago. And jewel cases seem to be much more inexpensive when I don't buy them with the CD-Rs. I suppose companies add them to your CD-Rs so you find them a "value".Using Sony CD-Rs are easy. I just do like I do with any CD-R, burn my files through Nero. I won't say these are completely burn free, but even the great Maxell has a couple mess-ups every once in awhile. But whether I'm burning music (for whatever reason since I now have an iPod) or burning important documents, these CD-Rs are very trusty with very little burn errors. Maxell is slightly more reliable than these, but for the price I can't see how you can go wrong.These CD-Rs also seem to last fairly long for me. I have a couple discs dating back to early 2004 that are seeing some minor scratch on the top of the disc, but it's certainly nothing unusable. Some discs dating back then are actually in pretty good condition compared to my TDK and Imaton discs. Some reviewers complain about data-loss after a year or so after burning, but I have yet to notice this. All of my CD-Rs from Sony seem to play fine in any CD player I use and my computer whatever the age of the disc. The bottom of the disc doesn't scratch as easily as other brands but collects fingerprints fairly well, which is again why I like using jewel cases. Also, the CD-Rs are very clean-cut, meaning they have lots of room to write on.Overall, these Sony CD-Rs work just fine for me. They don't show many burn errors and last a good long time, plus have the Sony name. They aren't quite as good as Maxell CD-Rs, but get the job done at a cheaper price. In general, a good "gets the job done without spending tons" CD-R. 4 stars."
To be completely honest, I think the whole HDTV thing is a bit over-hyped, mainly because there's so little HD stuff to watch right now. All DVDs are still NTSC definition, and the two HD camps in Japan are still dueling it out to see whose format will win (HD DVD vs. Blue-Ray). So-called HD channels on DirecTV and your (un)friendly local digital cable tend to show old craps nobody really wants to watch, and not everybody is into watching sports -- even there, nothing is as spectacular as your (suspciously) friendly local TV salesman makes it out to be.But if you are already on the HDTV bandwagon -- and our beautiful, freedom-loving, democracy-promoting government has conspired with the TV industry to make *all* analog TVs obsolete in the next year or two -- you may want to get an HDTV camcorder to record your life or shoot the next Blair Witch Project". In fact, if you are an aspiring filmmaker, (like some of my friends are), you'll want to get an HDTV camcorder.There aren't that many choices right now. In fact, the only HDTV camcorder for under $2000 is this Sony HDR-HC1, a slimmed down version of the $4000 HDR-FX1, which has caught the attention of many professional videomakers. BTW, you should definitely search the web (e.g., pricegrabber dot com) for a better price, as this can be had for as low as $1700 at some other legitimate websites (as of this morning).I was lucky enough to have a chance to look at, and play with, an HC1 at my local electronics store over the weekend. I was very impressed. First of all, it's a small camcorder and can be operated in one hand, and all the recording controls -- power, record, zoom -- care well placed for a normal adult hand. (As alays, this is a right-handed camcorder.) Second, amazingly, its lens has a manual focus-and-zoom ring, which allows for professional-looking shooting, esp. in low-light situations. Third, it uses REGULAR miniDV tapes, which are dirt cheap these days.What truly impresses me is the camcorder's ability to record in HDTV (1080i) or regular (NTSC) formats. I didn't get to check this out first-hand, but the salesman did a quick demo for me and it seems to have worked. (I was getting so dizzy from all the excitement and awe.) Video quality is very good for a single-chip camcorder -- and the resolution at HD setting is very high, provided you play back the HD recording on a, duh, HDTV. (Even a 720p HDTV will do, as such sets will automatically down-convert the 1080i signal.)If you want a camcorder that can truly impress your friends, yet don't want to shell out your entire savings, the HC1 will do very nicely -- and, by the way, it'll help preserve your moving memories in all its glory and some.Other Sony bells and whistles are included. The so-called intelligent battery which shows minutes remaining (but not always accurate -- and you definitely need a bigger battery), night vision mode (think "blair witch project"), bright and clear flip-out LCD screen, 10x optical zoom -- the sales guy told me it's about 42-430mm in 35mm-equivalent terms. And, as a bonus, you get a 3MP digital camera, which is good for casual shooting (and it's nice to be able to zoom in 10 times!).Other reviewers have pointed out a few flaws -- what they don't tell you is that nothing in this world is perfect, not even God, so it's just stupid to be nitpicky with such a revolutionary camcorder. Of course it has flaws, and given it's a Sony, it uses the superior-but-less-popular Memory Stick Duo flash memory card. But, if you search around, you'll see that Memory Stick media is not much more expensive than, say, Secure Digital.The biggest problem right now is you don't get a good yet inexpensive software program to edit your video on a computer. Of course, 99% of camcorder users don't do anything with their videos on the computer, so this may be a moot point for you.If you do want to do editing on a computer: on the PC side, you have many HD video editing programs to choose from, but they tend to be expensive. Good news is, the next version of Windows Movie Maker (free with Windows XP or Vista) is supposed to support the HD format. For now, you may be able to download trial versions of HD editing programs if you don't want to spend any money. On the Macintosh side, you can do some very basic stuff with the $100 iMovie program, but it doesn't do much, and the number of full-blown editing programs is limited for the Macintosh (which means Mac users will end up paying much more, like they do with everything else).And, according to my sales guy, you can't even copy the HD video to a DVD or VCR, since these latter devices don't support HD video yet. On the other hand, I've read on the web that you can convert HD video to regular video using free utilities available for Windows; but then, why would you do that, destroying the high def and high quality of your HD masterpiece?For now, whether you edit your video on a computer or not, the only way to play it back is from the HC1 directly. So you may want to wait until HD DVD is here before making a purchase -- by then, Sony and other companies will have released better, cheaper HD-compatible camcorders."
Tablet PC has been out almost a year now and is slowly gaining momentum in the corporate world. For the average consumer, though, I think it's still way over-priced and under-equipped in terms of software. In short, the Tablet PC platform is still largely a vertical market product.That said, having a Tablet PC does give the gadget freak a few cool things to enjoy. For example, scratch on a pad to your heart's full content. Not enough? How about watching a DVD movie at any angle you wish? Still want more? You can lie on your stomach and surf the web, you geek!The Protege 3505 is arguably the sleekest and strongest TPC on the market right now. It's a hybrid model with a keyboard which turns it into a notebook. Compared to the lower-rung 3500 model, the 3505 has more memory (512 vs. 256) and also comes with an external DVD drive. It has wi-fi built-in (along with Ethernet and IR), and depending on the specific configuration, you can opt for built-in Bluetooth as well.Performance is solid from the P3-M processor. You should know that the TPC version of Windows XP is optimized for the processors so you actually get a lot of performance at &quot;low&quot; clock speeds. (&quot;Low&quot; compared to desktop P4s; if you compare with Power PC G3 or G4's, these are still &quot;fast&quot;.) I certainly have no problem playing MP3s in the background while running a few Excel Solver analyses; the OS remains totally responsive.Battery life is average for TPCs, but weight is where Toshiba can improve. On the other hand, this is an affordable TPC, so you have to ask yourself which of the two (weight vs. price) is more important to you. Fujitsu's Tablet PCs are better built and only slightly less sleek, but their battery life is not as good as Toshiba while costing more. Sorry, still no perfect TPC yet.Should you get your Amazon Visa card out and order one right now? I'd say no. There isn't much software included, and the novelty factor wears off quickly, plus 4.1 pounds (not counting the external DVD) is a lot to carry. On the other hand, if your company pays for it, it's another story.
At first I liked this camera and was wowed by its ease of use and 1.8&quot; LCD viewfinder. But after about two weeks of heavy use, I've come to regret my purchase, because the picture quality is just not as good as I first thought.While the pictures have good color balance, they are overly sharpened. In everyday language this means you'll see jagged lines in your pictures, and main subjects (such as people) look as if they stand out from the background in a faux 3D effect. Pictures taken with the DX6440 also tend to be very noisy, even on a sunny day, resulting in lots of video-capture-like artifacts. This is especially true when you look at people's faces on screen. This is quite disappointing.Please note that I'm not saying the pictures taken with this camera are bad. If you get an offbrand product like Argus or Samsung you'll get truly bad pictures. Compared to those the Kodak gives good results. The pictures are acceptable and make nice prints here, but when compared to cameras in teh same price and megapixel class from Canon, Casio, Fuji, Konica Minolta, Nikon, and Sony, the DX6400 cannot hold a candle in terms of picture quality, period.Ultimately this is a point-and-shoot digital camera. You turn the dial to Auto mode and just snap away. There is a semi-manual mode called PAS (&quot;program, aperture priority, shutter priority&quot;) that offers limited manual controls. You cannot, for example, set both aperture and shutter, so pro photographers shouldn't buy this camera. Also, you'll have to turn the (flimsy) mode dial all the way around to get to the PAS mode, thus discouraging even a semi-serious photographer like myself who enjoys setting manual settings.The best feature on this camera is probably its 4x optical zoom, and zooming in and out is pretty fast. The lens is supposedly designed by a top German optical company, so it's too bad that the digital signal processing circuitry inside the camera does not retain images in top-notch quality.Some annoying cons/quirks are:- No case is included. This is the most disappointing aspect of the package. They give you a dock and two special batteries (one chargable included with the dock, the other non-chargeable included with the camera itself), but no case. Not even a cheap one. Kodak, why???- No independent playback mode. By this I mean you have to turn on the entire camera in order to play back pictures. It's plain silly to let the lens mechanism go to work if the user just wants to review a picture or two. This is part of what I meant earlier by the smart engineer/dumb interface designer thing. Kodak: take a look at Canon's products.- As mentioned before, the mode dial is just a stupid interface idea.- You operate the camera with your right hand, but the interface controller (a joystick) is operated with your left hand. Kinda awkward. Make that very awkward.- You cannot set compression level. You can only set the resolution (4, 3.5, 2 and 1). It would have been nice to be able to set compression level. (Of course, I'd have set it to the lowest compression anyway.)- Internal memory (16MB) and flash memory card are not treated as one integrated unit. Get this: when you are using the memory card, you cannot even review pictures in internal memory, unless you manually set storage mode to internal memory. But then, you won't be able to review pictures on the memory card. Again, very dumb.Ok, summary time. The quirks I listed above mean I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this camera. This comes as an ultimate disappointment to me because I always wanted to buy (and keep) an American-brand digicam. (HP digital cameras suck, period.) The Kodak's picture quality is disappointing with video-capture-like artifacts. The camera is very easy to use, but in the end, you'll be better served by excellent offerings from Canon, Casio, Fujifilm, Nikon, and Sony. Take a look at Canon S410 (4MP) or the Casio QV-R51 (5MP); both have top-notch picture quality.
My rating is based on the fact that I have been using a Jetprinter Z55 printer for 2 years long. During this time I have used a variety of after market ink cartridges as well as self fill cartridges for printing photos or documents. None of these provided the print quality as this cartridge form Eforcity. As such, I would like to only buy ink cartridge form Eforcity.
This lens hood designed specificaly for the Coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory. It does more than just protecting the lens, which it certainly does, esp. for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid. (Don't forget Murphy's Law.)But the lens hood can also improve your picture quality. As with SLR lenses, the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture. This is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused (scattered). Just use this all the time (see exception below) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best (all other factors being equal, of course).The only times you should *NOT* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700, esp. indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source. The hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject. Even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light, you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure.Get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera.
I wish people would refrain from lying; some people will do anything to defame Microsoft, a genuine, all-American company. The LifeCam VX-6000 installs easily, does not install secret non-essential software like Creative and Logitech installers do, and works beautifully with various IM clients. I tested it with different video chat programs and didn't enconter any problems on my two WinXP computers. I mainly use it with the new Windows Live Messenger (formerly known as MSN Messenger) and the video and audio quality are just superb. But I do think this might be a little too much if all you do is casual video chats. The cheaper VX-3000 is probably a better buy for most people. If you want a real digital camera, get a real one from Canon, Casio, Fuji, Nikon, Panasonic, Sony, etc. But if you do some video conferencing for business, the VX-6000 is a good investment.
Sony's D-NF610 slim CD &quot;walkman&quot; is an excellent personal audio companion. It's similar to its sibling D-NF510, except the NF610 has a digital tuner that pulls in AM/FM/TV and special weather channels, all in a compact, stylish form factor. Assembled in Malaysia (a country known for its anti-American politics -- hence one star deducted from my rating), the player seems pretty reliable. The weird shape is not as cool as Sony's perfectly round models, but it does allow for a larger, 2-line LCD display which, yeah!, can show MP3 tags. Another impressive feature is the 75-hour playback on two regular AA batteries.Sound quality is good if nothing to get overly excited about. As always, you may want to replace the included headphones with your own favorite. On a good pair of earphones, the &quot;digital mega bass&quot; boost adds a pleasant and clear boom to the music, so you know this is not a phony, irritating bass system typically found on the Coby's and Samsung's.The player also plays CD-R/RW discs burned with MP3 files or Sony's proprietary ATRAC3 files. Sony makes all kinds of claims regarding ATRAC3, but since 95% of the world uses MP3 and another 3% uses WMA and the rest probably AAC, I see little reason to burn ATRAC3 discs.Finally, the price is right for a high-quality portable CD player.
I had just recently moved to Chicago and saw this fabulous seafood restaurant around the corner from my apartment. Being from Vancouver and having access to fresh seafood all the time, I immediately requisitioned a few friends to try out Joe's Seafood last night. It was a hit! The host immediately seated us when we walked through the door, and the decor was great - simple and elegant. While we browsed the menu (did I say extensive?), we had ordered a bottle of white wine (from Napa Valley!) to accompany our meals. I couldn't choose, so I got the fisherman's platter following an appetizer of shrimp & scallop ceviche. My god! Even Maria, who's Peruvian, thought it was amazing. My friends got the stone crab and Chilean sea bass, and my boyfriend, Jeff, being the type of guy he is, went for the rib-eye. The prices were just right, and the food was excellent! We easily spent three hours here, finishing our meals and catching up. I was sorely tempted to get dessert, but by the end of our meals, I was so full that I made plans to come back on my own the next day. Oh, they do take-out AND have a gluten free menu - what's not to love? The service is great, and the menu has a lot of food that even the pickiest eater would have trouble finding fault with. My only complaint would be that there were no pictures on the menu (I'm a visual type of person), so it was hard to gauge the portions. All in all, this place comes highly recommended - you won't be disappointed. Make reservations in advance!
Frontera Grill has some of the most delicious food choices in a great atmosphere. It's a pretty casual restaurant with awesome staff who make you feel right at home. It's very colorful and they take great pride in keeping a clean restaurant. You can tell they only use the freshest ingredients in their authentic Mexican menu choices. I can't wait to try all of their menu options and would highly recommend this place to anyone. try it and you won't be disappointed!
My boyfriend took me to dinner last week at Frontera Grill. What a fun place! We started with Guacamole, and can I just say... it was amazing! I ordered Tacos Al Carbon, and they were so yummy. We had a great time, the service was outstanding and we will definitely be going back there again.
Wow. This restaurant is wonderful! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is a delight. Frontera Grill changes their menu every so often which I love because it keeps me coming back for more. The food is always delicious so I am excited to try what's coming up next. The people working at Frontera are always polite and friendly. I couldn't ask for better service! The place is so nicely decorated that it makes you feel right at home. I think you should come on in. I believe you'll love it just as I do!
I'm a big fan of bbq. Every Sunday as a family we enjoy grilling, but those days when we don't feel like cooking we make our way to the Weber Grill Restaurant. They have everything imagined my favorite are the ribs. It's a friendly environment for the whole family. They even have an awesome happy hour. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't know what they want to eat. I love coming to Webers Grill so much that it's makes me never want to cook on Sundays.
My wife and I were on vacation/visiting friends in Indy looking for a good local restaurant for dinner when we came upon the Weber Grill Restaurant. It looked good from the outside and we later found that the food served inside was even better. We wondered if the name was the same Weber of the grill fame and it turned our it is. I am always in the mood for a great steak or chops, so lucky for me the Weber Grill specializes in these items. I chose the Lamb chops because I cannot turn them down when I find them on a menu. My wife opted for the strip steak. Both were seasoned and cooked to perfection. The sides were great and the portion sizes were generous. Neither of us were super hungry after the main course, but the double chocolate bundt cake looked too good to turn down so we split one. Good decision on ordering and sharing it. It was awesome. But there is no way I could have finished the whole thing myself. If you are ever near any of the handful of Weber Grill locations, stop in and you will not regret it.
This restaurant was absolutely wonderful! I came here with my wife a few days ago and the atmosphere was so calm and warming. Weber Grill was a wonderful place for our anniversary dinner, and we will definitely be going back again soon. The service was great, the menu diverse and very professional looking, and the overall visit exceeded our expectations. Definitely one of my new favorites! Oh, and our food was delicious and cooked perfectly to our expectation!
I recently visited the Weber Grill Restaurant with my husband for a special 50th anniversary dinner. I was very pleasantly surprised with the service that we received, it was exceptional! We found ourselves surrounded by a lovely atmosphere and smiles everywhere we turned. The food was delicious as well, ( I had the Prime New York Strip ) which I highly recommend. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and you could really taste the difference that the charcoal grilling made in the flavor of the meat. We will certainly be back again!
Weber Grill Restaurant has undoubtedly win me over! My wife and I needed a place to celebrate our anniversary, and after checking the menu online decided to try Weber Grill Restaurant. We were promptly welcomed and sited very quickly. Our waitress was very polite and efficient throughout our meal. In fact, the whole staff seems very well trained and eager to give us the best experience possible. Weber being popular for their grilling, I ordered the Prime NY Strip and my wife ordered the Grill Twin Lobster Tails. The food met my expectations and then some! The steak was cooked perfectly and had that amazing back-yard grill taste to it. The Lobster tails were delicious and you could taste the freshness; my picky wife found nothing to complain about! So needless to say I will be coming back! Weber Grill Restaurant, keep doing what you do so well, and thank you for an excellent experience!!
There is not a restaurant in Chicago that I would more recommend than Weber Grill Restaurant. We were able to be seated right away when we came in. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They were able to suggest the perfect meal, seeing that it was my first time eating at the restaurant. My Prime NY Strip was cooked exactly the way I asked. My husband ordered lobster and he was satisfied as well. They were also very family friendly, and had some great options for my youngest child. Last but not least, the wine was some of the best that I have ever tasted. For such a great meal, this restaurant was surprisingly very affordable. I would definitely recommend it.
When I go to a restaurant there are 3 things I, and generally every rational person, looks for: quality, cleanliness, and excellent customer service. And Weber Grill Restaurant really knocks it out of the park categories. On the occasion that I attended this establishment, accompanied by my wife, we were first greeted by a warm, friendly hostess. I believe her name was Stella, we were promptly seated. The restaurant was about 3/4 of the way full, and shortly after being seated we met our waiter Joseph, who was prompt and thorough the whole time and. While waiting for our food I could not help but notice how clean and well decorated the restaurant was. It definitely looked like it could be a 5 star restaurant. For lunch I ordered "The Smokey Joe" and my wife had the "Southwest Turkey Wrap". Being from the south I had low expectations for a restaurant serving Barbecue above the Bible Belt. But the food really exceeded my expectations, not necessarily the quality of a 9-hour slow smoked brisket back home, but it was definitely one of the best damn Barbecue sandwiches I have had. I will definitely be back to this gem in the future. 4.5/5.0 Stars.
There are lots of places to get steaks in Chicago . . .but getting a great steak? That is a lot harder - unless you go to Joe's. We try and go every time we have out of town guests because there is no better way to showcase Chicago style steakhouses than Joe's. On the last visit, I had the seared Ahi tuna. It was a sushi grade cut of tuna, barely shown the grill before meeting my plate and arrived promptly. It was one of the best cuts of tuna I have ever had - almost as good as one on the beach overseas where I pointed to the tuna on a boat and it was cut and cooked on the beach. The tuna was that fresh. On prior visits, I've also had the salmon, chicken, and the ribeye. Service usually excellent, and the waiters are quite knowledgeable about wine pairings. Overall, I am always looking for an excuse to go back to Joe's!
My familyao>>s experience at Weber Grill Restaurant in Chicago was tremendous. The staff was warm, welcoming and able to answer all of our questions about the menu items. The lunch menu was more than reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food that was served. All of our entrees tasted wonderful, especially the Margherita pizza. The atmosphere provided was the best Iao>>ve ever experienced. We will definitely be visiting again, with friends next time!
Don't let the name fool you, the Weber Grill Restaurant is more than just hamburgers and hot dogs and as I found out this last weekend, one of the best steak houses around. My dining experience began this last Saturday around 6:00 pm and upon arriving at the Weber Grill I immediately assumed that I would be waiting for a while before being seated due to the fact that there almost wasn't an empty parking spot in the whole lot. To my pleasant surprise however I only had to wait about five minutes before being seated. I reviewed the menu and decided to splurge and ordered the Prime NY strip, medium well. The steak, which arrived in less than 15 minutes, was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The Parmesan Truffle Mashed Potatoes and grilled asparagus were a perfect pairing with the steak as well as the house made steak sauce. Equally as pleasurable as the meal was the service as well as the atmosphere. Overall my dining experience was extremely pleasurable and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this fine dining experience giving it a 5 out of 5 stars. Thank you Weber grill,
My wife and I went to the Weber Grill Restaurant a few weeks ago. The waitstaff was excellent, but expect a wait, even at the bar. I had the Grilled Colorado Lamb Chops and she had the Prime NY Strip. The food was absolutely amazing and I can easily say that these are the best lamb chops I've ever had.
The Weber Grill is a fantastic Restaurant. Anytime you want mouth watering steak, this is the place to go. The NY Strip Steaks are delectable. Although it's a little pricey, it's definitely worth it. The atmosphere is sub par to none and all the waiters are super hospitable. I felt like they were my personal waiters. This is definitely the place to take a date on a romantic night out.
I went to Weber Grill last night with my boyfriend and we had a great time! The live music made the whole atmosphere cool and the food was to die for! The Plank Grilled Chilean Sea Bass practically melted in my mouth and the vinaigrette dressing added a really nice touch. The asparagus was crisp but not crunchy and the recommended wine really kissed my palette! My boyfriend had the Prime NY Strip and said that was amazing too. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great, upscale night out! The food is affordable for the atmosphere and quality, and anyone can easily lose themselves in a great time.
So we went to Weber Grill Restaurant for lunch. I was entertaining some clients and thought I would try this place since I heard they had great lunch specials. It was a gamble, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had made a reservation for 4 and upon arrival, we only had to wait a few seconds before being escorted to our table. The hosts were very friendly and let us know our waiter would be right with us. Usually, at a busy lunch restaurant, one can only hope to be helped immediately, but they seemed to have plenty of staff to go around and we were helped right away. Joe was our waiter and you can tell he really cares about his customers having a great lunchtime experience in a timely fashion. I ordered the grilled vegetable panini off their $10 lunch special. It arrived nice and hot and the portion was quite sizable. My clients were also happy with their orders and we were greeted by the waiter at various times during our meal to make sure our drinks were refilled. We made it out in a reasonable amount of time given the volume of people in the restaurant, so I would definitely come back for a lunch meeting if Weber's keeps up this level of service. A+!!
Great atmosphere and service! Reasonably priced with an extensive menu for all ages and tastes. The Weber Starter Sampler was unbelievably good - hickory BBQ ribs just melt in your mouth. Grilled-fried pizza was out of this world and is a new favorite. Definitely will return for lunch and dinner in the future.
Weber Grill Restaurant is my family's favorite "home away from home" when it comes to dining out. With $10 lunches the whole family can enjoy and live music in the evenings on a few nights, Weber Grill is what American dining should be all about. American steakhouses can be tricky places to prune a following for. Either the house must be so fancy that casual diners can be intimidated, or it risks coming off like a standby truckers' buffet with overdone steaks. Weber Grill Restaurant is neither of those. Even though I feel like I can go there for a special occasion, I also feel like I can just pop in for a laidback evening with my spouse or closest friends. I love the downtown Chicago location for Weber because I can make a night of it in Chicago. There is so much more to do before or after dining there. But, I enjoy the suburban location as well: particularly in Schaumburg, Illinois, close to where I live. All restaurants have the same warm decor and impressive dining rooms. There is never a problem gaining a reservation at Weber, even on busy weekends. The staff at Weber are real pros when it comes to serving meals fast without making patrons feel like they must rush. And, patrons are able to have the best cocktails at the bar while they wait. My favorite meal, of course, consists of Weber's famous steaks. They are among the best I have had. The meat is prime and often locally-sourced. But, even people who do not eat red meat or meat at all can find something at Weber. They have a formidable a la carte menu, fresh market rate seafood and a variety of soups and salads to choose from. If you haven't checked out Weber Grill Restaurant during your residency in Illinois or vacation to Chicago, do yourself a great service and add it to your list. I plan to keep Weber a part of my life for a long time.
I was extremely happy with my first visit to Weber Grill. I had the Plank Grilled Chilean Sea Bass and it was perfect. Their menu for lunch looks a good bit different from their dinner menu so I can't wait to come back and try it. Our server helped to make this a great all around experience. She helped us choose what to order, knew the menu well, and didn't but us too often or too little. All around, a great dining experience for me.
My family and I very seldom have a chance to really get out and enjoy good restaurants as we mainly rely on home cooked meals 90% of the time. If we do, it's something quick and simple. There's nothing better than a great burger and I have to say that Mushroom Swiss burger was absolutely amazing to say the least. Being a cook myself, this was as if I'd made it myself and I am truly glad that we decided to stop and have lunch! We will definitely go back again.
A great fulfilling meal from Joe's! My friend and I visited Joe's after hearing much praise about the restaurant. Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted upon and it did not take long for us to be seated and waited on. We started with calamari (a must-have!) and oysters. The seasoning on the calamari was just right and the sauce was a great complement. Then we ordered the crabs, which far exceeded my expectations. They were a good portion and were fresh and broiled to perfection. And of course, I can't forget dessert! I have such a sweet tooth, so I know a good dessert when I come across one, and I must say, their blueberry pie was absolutely delicious. It was the perfect way to end the perfect meal. Compliments to Joe's for their excellent food and service! Definitely will be recommending to others and returning!
Weber Grill is one of the best places I have ever eaten! I'm a repeat customer they have kept on-board with their business for almost two months now! I actually came upon this restaurant through a co-worker outing after work to Smokey Joe's Bar, which was a very fun experience. But I had noticed that it was also a restaurant so one day I figured I would try it out and have loved it ever since. Yes the food is a little pricey. But the service, environment and the food is worth what you're paying! Favorite food would definitely be their steak. I love the NY strip so very flavorful and delicious! Definitely would recommend as a good bar or restaurant!
Weber Grill Restaurant has it all! From the delicious food to the daily drink specials and live music on Friday nights to the friendly staff, you will not be dissatisfied. The Grilled Oysters Rockefeller was the perfect entree and I'm still thinking about the steak I ate... I will definitely return!
The Weber Grill Restaurant is one of our families favorite weekend outings. They cook everything from delicious Sea Bass (my wife's favorite) to 18 oz. N.Y. Strip steaks (my favorite), all prepared on a traditional Weber grill. They also have a kids menu that my children love. The staff is amazing and have great insight on the menu. They also offer an impressive wine menu with variety like no other. And if you are on one of those no gluten diets they have an "out of this world" menu to cater to you with burgers, salads, ribs, seafood, and much more. They also have a fully stocked bar that has a warm and friendly atmosphere. All in all this restaurant impresses on many levels. Iv recommended them to family, friends, and clients. Keep up the good work Weber Grill Restaurant.
Satisfying All Around I had dinner at Gibsons last Thursday and can't say enough good things about this place. I eat here at least once a month and they never disappoint. When we arrived for dinner we did not have a reservation, but we were greeted right away by an effecient hostess who led us directly to the patio. I guess being a group of only two we lucked out and got to sit outside. Our waiter was fast and friendly, he chatted with us a bit, but was not too overwhelming. My steak, as always, was cooked to perfection and my guest enjoyed his as well. Great food, great staff and great patio- I will be back again during this summer!
I visited the Chicago branch of Gibsons Bar & Seakhouse, I was very pleased with nearly thanks aspect. The servers were friendly and quick, atmosphere was quite, which I enjoyed very much and best of all the New York Sirloin was to die for. I would give the Chicago branch a 4/5, its a must go if you live in the area.
My girlfriend and I came to Gibsons for our anniversary dinner and were delighted at the food, ambiance, and service. To start with - while pricey, the steak is well worth it. There are a variety of portions (all huge) and styles. The feel of the restaurant it classy/dressy - we wanted a nice place to celebrate and this fit the bill perfectly. The service was delightful - fast, courteous, and with good wine recommendations (a necessity for this beer drinker!). If you still have room, the desserts are to die for. An added bonus - convenient valet service out front. Five stars! The perfect fancy date place!
Ah, Gibsons. Where do I begin? I began the day weeping gently in my cheap hotel room, desperately eating a Klondike bar, trying to fill the hole in my soul. After waking up at noon from a drug and alcohol induced coma, I wandered over to Gibson's, where I found the greatest steak I have ever eaten. Perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, yet not too rare. The seasonings were excellent. As I sat down in this delicately lit, perfectly equipped with ambient music, I felt myself re-inflate mentally. I ordered quickly and quietly, avoiding the server's respectful downward gaze by using one of my own. When my Tanqueray and Tonic arrived, it was excellent: Genuine Tanqueray, about 50-50 tonic and Tanqueray, extra lime jsut how I like it. As I was half through my drink, the steak arrived with fresh, crisp veggies (steamed, not boiled) and moist mashed potatoes with a generous splash of gravy over them. As I picked up my knife and fork, I almost felt human again. At the end of my meal and my drink, I felt certainly human, and ready for another night with "Frank" and "The Director" as Phil Collins plays in the background. Until this shoot is done, I will be coming back here - nightly.
I recently went to Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse in the Chicago area, and had an absolutely wonderful dining experience. I was seated promptly and the host was very friendly. My waitress came to my table rather quickly and told me about the specials of the day. I ordered a shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and it came out in a reasonable amount of time and was really delicious. The shrimp was seasoned perfectly and the cocktail sauce served was incredible. After my appetizer, I tried the New York Sirloin which was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. I ordered it medium-rare and the kitchen hit the mark perfectly. After a great dining experience at Gibsons, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for high quality food in the Chicago area. The prices were a little high, but the food is definitely worth it!
Best steak in Chicago! We started with the Crabmeat and Avocado, it was fresh and absolutely mouth watering. For dinner, I ordered the 10oz Filet Mignon, they also offer a 14oz. The steak was cooked perfectly, it was tender , juicy, and the flavor did not disappoint. We barely saved room for dessert but couldn't pass it up. We had be told how delicious there pies are and to try atleast one. Our server warned us about the massive portions, so we decided to split the macadamia turtle pie. It was to die for! It was the perfect balance of rich, creamy, and sweet. I was tempted to order one to go! We will definitely be back.
It was my husbands birthday and we wanted to do something special. I let it be his choice and he selected Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse. While I have never been there, some of my friends have and they did nothing but rave about it. So off we went. They have a large selection of usda angus beef, which steak just happens to be my husbands favorite. While they are a bit pricy, they did live up to their name of generous portions. My husband had the Chicago Cut 22oz of pure beef. It was worth the pricey prize tag. I had the filet mignon 10oz, both steaks cooked to perfection. They also have plenty of apetizers. They had lobster, clams, and all the salads and soups to please all tastes. The service was devine. I felt like we were the only ones the waiter had to service. His name was Steve, and I would recommend sitting in his section, if given a choice. He made us feel real special. Like I said they have a full menu, chicken, king crab, tons of sides, very generous, I had lunch for the next day with all my left overs, even I have to admit, my husband for the first time ever actually had a doggie bag. I would recommend this restaurant and we will be visiting again, I assure you, I want to try it all.
I went here for dinner on Fathers Day and I was really pleased with the special they offered. It included appetizer, main dish and even desert. I also thought it was cool how they sent my dad home with a free gift of Joes steak spice. My dad had a good time as well and the pricing was pretty descent. I definelty recommend this restaurant and I am sure ill be back too.
My husband and I recently celebrated our 12th anniversary at the Rosemont location of Gibsons Bar and Steakhouse. This restaurant is much more elegant than anywhere we would normally go, so in spite of being excited, I was afraid we might feel out of place. This was a unnecessary worry however, and the exceptional staff made sure we were quite comfortable. We took advantage of the complimentary valet parking and were seated very quickly. We started our evening with a couple of their famous martinis...and yes they are quite large! For dinner I chose the Filet Mignon and my husband enjoyed a 13oz New York Sirloin. For desert we shared a divine chocolate hazelnut cake. The portions were very generous, the service impeccable and the food, heavenly. We will definitely be returning to Gibsons for our special occasions in the future.
I have been to Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse several times, each time being a pleasant visit. They have vallet parking. The service was very good, we were waited on promptly and the food arrived in a timely manner. There was so much to choose from menu. The food was fantastic and the prices were comparable. All in all, I felt very favorable to this restaurant. I would, and have, recommended this place to friends and family.
Looking for a nice date-night restaurant?...Gibson will fit the bill. It has a good, top drawer, classy-without-being-ostentatious atmosphere, lit in a quiet way that fosters intimate dining and an overall good vibe. (If you are there in the right time of year, add some oysters on the half shell as an appitizer, they are top quality, fresh, small and a real treat). My favorite steak order is their one pound "WR" sirloin...and you can depend on the fact that you will receive your steak rare/medium rare/-whatever/ EXACTLY the way you ask for it. The service is very good, the wait staff were attentive without being intrusive, and knowlegable about specific items I asked about, both bar and menu listings. A word of warning about the valet parking though...yes, it will be necessary, given the area...but with a charge of 14.00. (OK, I know this is supposed to be a fake review, but I really have had lovely evenings at the Gibson's in Rosemont)
I visited Gibsons for the first time today. I am from out of town and it is very rare to find restaurant quality like this. The food was amazing and extremely cost effective. I basically got 2 meals out of the one I paid for. My service was exceptional and the environment was clean and mostly quiet. Overall, this was a great experience.
Gibsons is the kind of place you go for a really nice evening. You can tell they keep standards -- clean environment, professional severs, and nice presentation of the menu. They even keep standards of their guests: no men in sleeveless shirts. You might find it a turn-off, but I like that guests are encouraged to promote the overall swanky feel of the restaurant. When you're there, you're not just at some neighborhood grill or dive restaurant, you're having an elevated experience. And that's all not even to mention the food, which is amazing. I am a steak lover and I had the porterhouse, which was generously portioned and cooked absolutely perfectly. The texture was almost buttery it was so tender; I can honestly say I've never had a better cooked steak. But the perfection of the menu doesn't stop at the beef, something you might expect at a steakhouse. Not at Gibsons. My boyfriend doesn't eat red meat (too bad for him at such a restaurant!) and he had the roasted chicken, which was seriously just as buttery and amazing as my steak was. I found myself picking off his plate any scraps I could find when he wasn't looking. In short, the restaurant is everything you want from a nice night out. The service is prompt and attentive as well; we left a generous tip. We will definitely be back in the near future, it may be my new favorite spot for date night.
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse offered a wide variety of food on their menu. Scenery was excellent and the staff was polite. Food was great and the wait time was little. The bar offered a large variety of alcohol and the restaurant was very clean. Located in a convenient part of Chicago. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Recently, I discovered an amazing Chicago restaurant, Gibson's Bar & Steakhouse. I had heard of this restaurant and its good reputation, but hadn't had the opportunity to check it out until now. Wow! I am now a huge fan. Not only were the portions generous, but all parts of the meal were done to perfection. My martini was much larger than usual. I also really appreciated the dress code...anything other than sleeveless shirts for men are permitted although many men were dressed in shirts and others in jeans. I found the valet parking especially important in downtown Chicago. I am now a huge fan of this unique and classy restaurant and can't wait for my next visit with that special someone.
My husband and I are the parents of a young child and we finally got the chance to have a night away, so after a bit of coin tossing we decided to give Gibsons' a try. I have to say, the coin was in our favor! We did arrive at a popular time, but the wait was no more than you'd expect before we were seated, and we got drinks right away. The lobster cocktail may be the greatest thing I've ever eaten. Seriously? Try it, it's amazing! My husband is an absolute Prime Rib junkie and he's still talking about it. The prices seem on par, if not a little higher than our other favorite, Morton's..but in the end, we've definitely decided we'll be going back! Great service! Great food! Great experience all around!
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse is a small restaurant in midtown Chicago with excellent food and a very comfortable and casual atmosphere. This being the first time I had eaten there, I decided to go all out. I ordered the New York Sirloin with a Double Baked Potato and House Salad. The food took a bit, but the wait was well worth it. My steak was cooked to perfection just as I had ordered it and everything tasted scrumptious. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I could not have asked for a better dining experience. I can't wait to visit again and try some more of their mouth-watering menu selections. I'll definitely be recommending Gibsons to all of my family and friends.
My wife and I visited Gibsons for our anniversary dinner. It was our first time eating at the restaurant. We were able to make reservations through their website without having to call in. When we arrived at the restaurant we found that the only parking available was valet. I wouldn't have minded if the charge was fair, but the $14 fee before tip was a bit too much for my liking. Once we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly by a friendly hostess. Our waiter was quick to take out drink order and bring over glasses of water. We both had the house wine, which was decent. A bit too dry for my taste, but drinkable. We ordered Filet Mignon as our appetizer. My wife had the 10oz, I had the 14oz. The steaks came out in a timely fashion and were cooked exactly as ordered. The meat itself was tender, flavorful without being overbearing. I enjoyed the garlic mashed potato sides and asparagus. The portions were large enough that would could not have even considered desert. Overall, the experience was positive. The food was good and worth the price. The valet parking was a bit too expensive, but the food and service more than made up for it.We would definitely return.
If you're ever in the Chicago area, you MUST make a reservation (or several) to experience Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. Imagine that your taste buds are starving and Joe's is the Oasis to quench their thirst. Our party of 6 was swiftly seated once we all arrived. My friends had to drag me along with them since I wanted to stop and look at all the plaques and interesting decor along the way. It is always promising to be intrigued by the decor and feel at home by the staff. Our handsome waiter gave me the impression that he had been highly trained and was serious about making our time there the most memorable. The menu was quite extensive and the waiter was very patient with us going over the daily specials and helping us make our selections. While I was appalled that one of our party actually ordered a classic hamburger for $15.00, it arrived perfectly cooked to order and looked like it was prepared to be photographed on the cover of Bon Appetit Magazine. All of his menu selections seemed to be as close to his daily lifestyle and simple tastes, but the recipes for these culinary masterpieces seemed to surprise me at every turn, including the macaroni and cheese, as a side dish. He devoured it with enthusiasm and teased the rest of us that we were missing out on the best burger he's ever had. Each and everyone of us specifically chose a different portion of the menu to order from. We wanted the full experience and while most things were expensive for our budget, it was well worth the extra cost. We will be returning each and every opportunity that we are able. It was an eating experience we want to indulge in more.
Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse. What can I say about them? Well, I guess I can start out by saying this is my new favorite restaurant. The food? Amazing. The staff? Very friendly and super helpful. The prices? Very reasonable. What more can you ask for from a restaurant? I asked for a New York Strip Steak, cooked medium rare, and guess what I got. Exactly that. Cooked perfectly, wonderfully sized portion, and tasted so good. I can't wait to go back, but I am not sure what I want to try next. Maybe a burger? Probably not. The steak was too good to ever pass up. I walked in and was immediately friendly and helpful. I got a table almost immediately. My waitress, Alice, started out by asking if I wanted to order some appetizers or drinks. She was very friendly and helpful without being overly-annoying or invasive. Needless to say, she got a nice tip. The food, though priced slightly high, was very reasonable when you consider the portion size, flavor, and speedy service. Overall this is an amazing place, and I 100% recommend you check it out. 4.5/5
Gibson's Bar and Steakhouse is awesome! The food was delicious, the wait staff was lovely and it was the best steak in chicago. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.
My husband and I stumbled upon Gibson's by accident in downtown Chicago. You know how it is when you try a new place, is it really going to be worth the money? Well, it was, the food was amazing. The prime rib and double baked potato were amazing and we shared chocolate mousse for dessert. We definitely didn't leave hungry! It was a tad on the pricey side for us, but the food was so worth it and the service was top notch! I would definitely go back again.
Girl and the Goat has a wonderful atmosphere! I felt very relaxed and had a great, private meal. The flavors were paired very well together and dishes were original. I'll be heading back soon!
I just tried Girl and the Goat for the first time and was blown away! When you first walk in you're greeted with friendly staff and long, wooden, family-style table seating. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the menu is filled with craft beers and and veggie/fish/meat entrees. Everything we ate was so fresh! We (my girlfriend and I) started with the roasted cauliflower. Pickled beets and peppers popped in your mouth with every bite! My girlfriend loved her scallops and charred pork belly was to die for. We will be back soon, because everything on the menu deserves to be tried at least once!
My wife and I ate here recently for our anniversary, and we thought the ambiance was lovely. I had the roasted pickles, which I have never had, and quite enjoyed the savory flavor. My wife chose the sauteed green beans which she thought were tasty and a healthy option. I also had the pan roasted halibut, which was cooked well, and the white asparagus served with it was flavored well and not bitter, compared to white asparagus I've had in the past. Their wine selection was quite good, and we shared a bottle of Endrizzi Chardonnay. Altogether, this was a pleasant dining experience and I would recommend it to others.
Are you looking for a fun and tasteful new restaurant to try out? Girl & the Goat is the place to explore with your taste buds. The food is unique (in a good way) because they offer food variations that you normally don't see in a restaurant. My favorite combination would have to be Grilled Baby Octopus with a nice cold brew. Along with the great food quality comes with great customer service. Girl & the Goat as some of the nicest waitstaff a restaurant could ask for. They are not just trying to sell you food, but trying to make your experience at the restaurant that much better. If I had to rate this place, I would give it a 10 out of 10. This is a most place stop!
What can I say about Girl and the Goat? Every Chicagoian wants to get in here and eat at some point. I finally got my chance during my anniversary dinner, where my husband make reservations without me catching on! The restaurant was so warm and inviting and I even caught a glimpse of the chefs working as we were seated. The decor was amazing, and the selection of food was phemonimal. I order the crispy pork belly, and the hubby had some confited goat belly. The presentation was out of this world and so was the taste. I was in heaven. We left full, but not feeling fat. The food was rich without feeling like there was real weight to it. Such a great experience, I can't wait to go back!
Really enjoyed my experience here. First thing I noticed was the atmosphere. The decor created a very rustic and older feeling, which was very nice. The waitress was with us immediately taking our order, which was awesome as it was so fast. She was very polite and fast with our drink orders. They had an amazing collection of craft beers that fit our group perfectly, and we all sampled a couple different ones. We placed our food orders and enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. When the food came out it looked unbelievable. It was displayed extremely nice, and tasted even better. Overall, the experience was amazing and I recommend the Girl and the Goat to anyone who enjoys good food, rustic atmosphere, and craft beers. Thanks!
In a "foodie" town like Chicago, there is the hottest new restaurant about once a month. The Girl and the Goat deserves every one of the thousands of gushing accolades. It is a stunning combination of adventurous, luxurious taste sensations, combined with a fun atmosphere that makes every dinner seem like a party. I took a large group to dinner there this week and we all enetered as sort of uptight partial strangers and exited as best friends over the course of one of the most memorable meals I've had. The chef recommended a tasting menu of the restaurant "greatest hits" signature dishes ( oh my, the pigface! Oh my, the roasted goat leg !) and combined with the warm, funny attentions of our server Brendan ( who at the end of the evening was also considered to be a best friend), this meal was perfect! It is expensive, but worth every penny. If you are looking for dinner to be an event- don't walk- run to the Girl and the Goat!
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. I consider myself to be a true foodie and I am consistently blown away by the quality of food and level of service at Joe's. It is truly what upscale dining should be. I have been to Joe's many times and have never had a bad experience. I look forward to many visits to Joe's in the future.
I and several coworkers were in Chicago on business; after we closed the deal, the locals recommended this place (Girl and the Goat) when we asked for a good place to relax and celebrate. We decided to give it a try. The place is in the West Loop, glad we were using transit since parking would have been iffy. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but took that as a good sign, since the place was packed and busy. I checked out the menu on my phone while we waited, I liked that many of the entree listings include where the ingredients were sourced from, and links to read more about these places. Our server was friendly and fast, and the actual restaurant was comfortable and clean. It was obviously a very popular local place. We tried a few different craft beers, I had a Great Lakes Eliot Ness. Much better than having a Budweiser at a chain restaurant! Menu has vegetable, fish, or meat choices; we had the wood grilled broccoli, Skuna Bay salmon, and I had the crisp braised pork. Didn't take nearly as long as we expected, given how busy they were, and the food was fantastic! Great service, good booze and food, nice place, and the bill was very reasonable. We're definitely eating here again when in Chicago.
Went to Girl and the Goat while visiting the Chicago area, and I can't thank who recommended it enough. Like the name would imply, it's not a typical restaurant. With such a great staff it has the atmosphere of having a meal with a bunch of best friends you just met. The staff was so much fun, and the food was great as well as the craft beers. I heard that all the produce (including the meat) is produced on local farms, so it is guaranteed to be fresh. Would highly recommend Girl and a Goat to anyone.
I recently ate at the Girl & The Goat restaurant. I was hoping to find something unique, great tasting, and a great atmosphere and I found this place to have all three qualities. I had an awesome portion of sauteed green beans and an appetizer. I had an awesome goat loin dish for my mian course that was cooked to perfection and I can't wait to have that again. The strawberry parfait to top it off did not disappoint. I plan to try the oysters next time, it looked as though the couple at the next table was enjoying them. Their menu has plenty of variety to offer. I highly recommend this place for a date night but it also works for a casual dinner. I will be back!
After months of planning and putting off, I finally found myself seated at a table in Chicago's much talked about hot spot, Girl and the Goat. The restaurant is both elegant and eclectic at the same time creating a symphony for the senses even before the meal. I started out with the fried pickles I'd heard so much about, and let me tell you the accolades were not unfounded. Delightful little treats that had me eagerly wanting more. Now normally I'm all for a steak, but this night I was feeling quite bold, so throwing caution to the wind I ordered escargot Ravioli featured on the evenings menu. Although not sure what to expect, I have but one word, amazing! Chef Stephanie Izard is a true master of the culinary arts and deserves all the accolades she has received and more. Unfortunately my time was short and waist line was expanding so desert had to be skipped, but should I get back to Chicago, I can promise you Girl and the Goat will be a must stop on my list.
We went to girl and the Goat to celebrate a birthday. We all loved the chickpea fritter appetizers and the wood grilled broccoli. The atmosphere is fun and casual. Service was fast and friendly. Our favorite entree was the delicious skuna bay salmon.
I love the Girl & the Goat. I take my wife there at least twice every month and the food and drink is nothing but outstanding. We usually get the Belgian Ale, but we also love the wine and cocktails. The food menu offers a wide range of options, ranging from fried pickles to beef tongue. While we mostly stick to the drinks, we also love their fried oysters. Overall, I love the Girl & the Goat and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time with good food and drink.
Very good veggie options. Wide range of selection. However, if you are looking for meat based on the name you will be sorely disappointed. Does not have very many traditional options but a decent variety of weirder items. Interesting atmosphere, good service.
Yum! Such a great place to dine for a succulent and nicely priced meal! Not only was the food absolutely to die for, I had the green garlic potato wontons, but the atmosphere was nothing short from ideal. The service was incredibly friendly and the meal arrived very quickly. I give this place two thumbs up!
I just happened upon Girl and the Goat with my family and boy am I so glad that I did. It is a bit pricey but the food is totally worth it! The chickpea fritters are to die for. Its a great place to hang out with family. The service was good. Our waitress Ashley was hilarious. We will definitely be returning.
Our dinner started with a warm set of olives. The tart and sweetness of the combined olives was superb. Next came the squash blossom rangoon. In which the almonds gave a good crunch. Our entre was a pan roasted halibut. The food was surprisingly wonderful and paired with the rustic feel of the resturaunt made for a wonderful experience. One I would like to repeat over and over.
What a great place for surf and turf! My husband and I went to Joe's for our anniversary dinner last week. The atmosphere was fantastic, and the food presentation was gorgeous. The wine list is extensive and truly a delight for any connoisseur. The staff is friendly and professional. Truly sensational, a must have in the Chicago area. Oh, and the New York Strip is to die for!
I took my fiance to Girl & the Goat for his birthday recently, having heard rave reviews about the restaurant's craft beers and amazing entrees. We were not disappointed. The service was stellar, and the food was out of this world. The chef even made an appearance at our table to bring out dessert. By the way, the Miso Butterscotch Budino is divine. If you haven't tried it yet, get thee to Girl & the Goat at once.
The atmosphere was really wonderful and I really appreciate how nice the servers were. They knew all the different types of beer and what each one tasted like. They were very helpful in recommending what to order. I like how the menu changes and it is not the same thing every time. I would be more than happy to recommend this restaurant to another friend. Once again, thanks for the spectacular service and food. Needless to say the beer was fantastic.
The Girl and the Goat restaurant is easily one of my all time favorite places to eat. I absolutely love inviting a few friends out to have a good time and enjoy some awesome food. The atmosphere is very chic beautiful, just looking around the place is like having a blast! Personally, I highly recommend the green garlic potato wontons, they are so delicious and you'll want to take a few home for later! Between the food, the drinks and the place itself, you will quickly become a fan.
My wife and I loved this restaurant. We had the Fumo Negli Occhi and granted it was a little small but filled us both up. What a great value this place is. I will be back when I'm around this area again.
Chef John Coletta of Quartino (Chicago) has outdone himself. His curious and interesting selection of how to prepare dishes leave the taste buds satisfied, such as the Ravioli stuffed with braised pork, speck and fava beans. If you are a wine/cheese pairing novice, ask the staff to choose for you as their knowledge is quite in-depth. We were quite happy with the size of the portions - not too large, not too small. Also, the salad selections were varied and had something for everyone - from beets to naval oranges to walnuts and house-made burrata. Lastly, the ambience of the restaurant is refreshing and not stuffy as sometimes places can be when they offer a truly upscale menu. We recommend, if there's room, sitting out on the charming and cozy patio deck overlooking the street. It's a great way to people watch and get some fresh air, while enjoying a spectacular meal!
I've been to Quartino's several times for several different occasions for both business and leisure. Quartino's staff always knows how to tend to my needs perfectly--they are always very helpful and very knowledgeable about the daily specials and menu items. I loved the vintage decor throughout the restaurant and their great selection of wines. The thing I love most about this place is the option of choosing the shared menu where two people can eat a three meal course for a very reasonable price. They have valet parking which is always a plus and serve both individuals and large groups. You can book reservations directly on their website which is great because you can book on the go. I would definitely recommend the roasted calamari or salmon and my favorite pasta is the gnocchi. Chef Cotello is one amazing chef and his restaurant is by far one of the best in Chicago.
recently I ate at a restaurant called Quartino an Italian restaurant. Upon arrival I noticed the outside was very well taken care of, the ground were well maintained and there was no litter on the ground. As I walked in the first thing I noticed was the smell of cleanliness and good food. the hostess greeted me promptly even though it was busy and told me the wait time would be about 20-30 minutes but told me could have a seat at the bar where I was offered o complimentary glass of wine. The wait time was accurate as I was seated 25 minutes later. The server greeted me right away and took my drink order. He returned with in 10 minutes with my drink, and a basket of fresh bread and butter. Upon his return he started telling me about the specials they were offering that night. I placed my order and was served with in 15 minutes. All in all I had a very wonderful experience at Quartino. The service was outstanding, the staff was efficient and courteous, the restrooms were well stocked and clean. I will be returning there in the future and will be telling my friends and family that I highly recommend this fine dining experience.
I always look forward to business trips to Chicago, because I know I will have the opportunity to be swept away to Italy - at least in a culinary and dining atmosphere sense - when I dine at Quartino Ristorante and Wine Bar on North State Street in downtown Chicago! I know that I can drop the worries of the day and indulge in the yummy and beautifully presented regional specialties they offer. The ambience at Quartino is always warm and welcoming, and the staff is always helpful and dedicated to providing excellent service. As for the food...on my 3 visits to Quartino, I have never found a dish I didn't like. If I had to pick my two favorites, they would be the crispy calamari with organic tomato sauce and the organic veal skirt steak, served with wild arugula, roasted grape tomatoes, and balsamic syrup. Chef Coletta and his team have put together such a sumptuous menu that limiting myself to two favorites is nearly impossible. Everything has been delicious. The prices are very reasonable, the food is fabulous, and the service is always above and beyond expectations. I would definitely recommend Quartino if you are ever in downtown Chicago.
For a moment I thought I was in Rome, it was Monday and I was visiting Chicago for Business. At lunchtime my Business partner recommended the Quartino. I could not think of a better choice. The wine was half price on Mondays, so we considered that we were in the right place at the right time. The Quartino presented the best of Italian traditional mouth-watering fare. It was difficult to choose from the many option because everything smelled so good. I had that sense of nostalgia as I glanced at the menu. The Artisanal Alumi, Neopolitan thin-crust pizza, house made Pizza brought back special memories of my 3-day trip to Rome. The first time I had eaten Artisanal Alumi was in Rome. Chef Colletta did an excellent job! Fine dining, excellent wine and authentic Italian atmosphere is the feeling you get when you walk in. As you walk in you are greeted by the effervescent personality, Chef John Colletta. He is famous for transporting the culture of Rome to the bustling city of Chicago. We needed to talk business so we were able to enjoy the private dining that they offered. The Waitress said 'Bon Apetiti' and we sat down to an enjoyable Business 3 course lunch special for $25. Yum! What a treat
The first time that my husband and I came to dine at Quartino, was for our Saturday date night.We pick a different restaurant to check out on the last Saturday of every month. This time we had decided on finding something delightful in the downtown area of Chicago. I had heard great things about Quartino's menu from friends and we are both always very eager to try new places, especially because we both love Italian food so much. We are both pretty good cooks, and we loved getting inspired by eating out. On our first night dinning at Quartino's I decided that I would only try they vegetarian dishes while my husband would try a meat dish as a main menu, and we would share the appetizers. The restaurant was packed on Saturday night, brimming with lively chatter and a mixture of delicious aromas. We felt immediately at ease as we were seated by our served. We started off with the white bean and garlic spread, the chilled zucchini and polenta fries which we had to order a second round of! They were absolutely incredible! We also ended up finishing a bottle of delicious Itlaian wine with dinner. I had the mouthwatering, homemade gnocchi and my husband had beef short ribs. We were both in heaven and I though I wanted to not eat meat, I had to try the short ribs, and they were well worth it! The ambiance was warm and welcoming, the food incredibly delicious and our check was very, very reasonable. Quartino has quickly become one of our favorite places to dine out in Chicago and we love sharing it with friends.
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab is an excellent place to dine for any occasion. Very authentic and delicious cuisine. Everything about the experience I received there was outstanding, from the ambiance, great service, and incredible on-trays. Great variety, great scenery, and great people. I was thoroughly satisfied with Joe's. I will be frequenting there often, and would recommend anyone else to do the same.
I finally decided to try Quartino, a restaurant in downtown Chicago I had heard many good things about. I showed up at about 6pm on a Friday evening with a close friend, and after a short wait (it was busy!) was given a table on the outdoor patio. I was greeted by a waiter very quickly and we each ordered a glass of red wine off a pretty impressive wine list - I had a pinot and she had a cab. The menu is tapas style with MANY dishes to choose from and share with the table. We decided to order a couple small plates to share, and an entree each. We started with Duck Prosciutto and the Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare, which is a mixture of octopus, shrimp and clams cooked in a tomato sauce - it was a bit more expensive but so worth it! We wanted to try something new and this was an incredible dish. Cooked well and seasoned perfectly. For our main course I got the Veal Osso Buco and she ordered the ravioli. My osso bucco was perfectly cooked - it tasted like it had been cooking all day! It was served with an herb based condiment that pair perfectly with the rich veal. I was told the ravioli (which was hand made in house) was tender and full pork goodness. It also contained speck, which I have never had but tried, and was very bright and floral. In a strange way, it worked perfectly with the pork and tomato sauce. After dinner, we were too full to order dessert, but I will definitely be returning - possibly for a digestif and an Italian dessert I've never had before? Despite being very busy, the service was attentive and the food was served hot. I have already recommended this place to my friends and will be returning several times in the future!
When I first walked into Quartino I was greatly surprised (in a good way!). I have been to many restaurants in the area and in Chicago in general but the atmosphere and presentation here jumped out at me. Something about it was so simplistic and comforting, I felt like a regular the first time I walked in. It made me want to return without having even tried the food! I was greeted by a host when I came in and was sat down at my table. The service was good. He was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable, however the place was very busy so he was running around to serve his many tables (not his fault). I ended up deciding on the Margherita pizza. The ingredients tasted very very fresh. I'm not much of a pizza person myself, but I tried it at the recommendation of the next table over and was very glad I did. I boxed up the 2nd half of the pizza for dinner, I wanted to have room in my stomach to try at least one more thing. I went with the "Chilled Zucchini - Grilled with sun dried tomatos." accompanied by the wine of the month, a 2011 Rosado from Spain. I probably should have asked for help pairing the wine plates with an appropriate wine, the server gave me some great recommendations that I didn't take him up on. It was still very very tasty, and worked decently, but next time I'll be sure to take the servers advice. They are there for a reason! Overall my experience at Quartino was excellent! The food, service, and atmosphere all came together nicely for a very holistic experience. I would recommend this place to others, however I would say it is best with 2-4 people. I can't wait to take my out of town friends here. Four and a half out of five.
I ordered the ravioli and the salmon, and I have to say, it was one of the best dinners I have had this year. The salmon was perfect, and the pork inside the raviolis was something I've never had before, but will be getting again. Prices may be a tiny bit high for some people, but it is well worth it for the quality of food they serve. I would recommend Quartino to anyone, and have recommended already to my family members. Very, very good restaurant.
Having heard the rants and raves of fellow co-workers, I decided to head on over to Chicago's own Quartino for lunch - I had heard that for the price, you could not beat the quality of service and the tantalizing flavors presented to you. As I walked in, I was greeted by a warm, professional, but welcoming face. After finding out I had no reservations, I was assured I would have a seat within minutes. To my delight, I was given a table for two on the patio. The sun was shining, the gentle drone of the city seemed to fade away and I began to understand Quartino's charm from the get go! Within a matter of minutes, an intelligent and delightful waiter came to introduce himself to me, as well as answer any questions I had about their wonderful and extensive wine selection. They didn't have my favorite wine, but when I inquired, he quickly pointed me to a wine he was convinced I would love! He didn't disappoint. I was delighted. After my drink arrived, I explained that I was short on time and that I had come to sample their lunch special, 3 course meal. He was quick to make a few suggestions, as he could tell I was the adventurous sort - or as some would say - unable to decide. Having loved his wine recommendation, I trusted this gentleman with my meal choices as well: "Let's see what he's made of," I said to myself. The first course was a presentation of a Roasted Beet Salad. I'm usually pretty reserved about Beets, but I was determined to expand my horizons and to allow my waiter to guide me though. I was delighted when I found a crunch in my salad, Walnuts. So often these salads are one dimensional in texture - leaving you a bit wanting, but this time I was pleasantly surprised. An excellent paring with the sweetness of the roasted beets. On to the next course, with a clean plate! Next to arrive at my quaint table on the patio, was Duck Prosciutto. When you and I typically think of Prosciutto, we think of pig, so of course, I was skeptical. My conscience was soon eased by the light gaminess of the duck. I had worried that it would be too gamey for me; however, the seasoning pulled out the more poultry aspects of the duck and my mouth was left watering - 'Compliments to the Chef!' Wanting to end on a light note, I requested my third course be a soup. He offered his Sun-Dried Tomato Soup. I was weary. Sun-Dried Tomato usually seems pretty rich and deep, almost acidic in flavor - a bowl full of that sounded like a nightmare. When the dish came out though, with the expected basil I was met with a pleasant added surprise - Ricotta Crostini. This gem added a unique twist to my childhood "Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup." And that is exactly what it was, an adult version of my childhood favorite. Not too rich, or acidic - absolutely delightful. I finished up with enough time to take a small stroll through the restaurant and explore their bar - perhaps that will be my next venture! For now, I left full, satisfied and returned to work another one of those ranting and raving Quartino junkies. Service? Flawless. Food? Decadent and Delightful. General Feel? Exciting, but welcoming - like a family gathering in Italy!
I love coming to Quartino for dinner! The house-made pasta dishes are really delicious, especially the tagliatelle (my favourite). The prices are reasonable, and you get a lot of food for your money. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town.
My husband and I ate at Quartino's this past weekend. Although we were dissapointed that there were no available tables outide on the patio; I absolutely loved the historical decor on the inside of the resaurant. We shared the Soprano pizze, it was amazing! We can't wait to take my husband's parents there when they are in town next month. If the weather allows hopefully we will get to enjoy a patio table.
I visited this restaurant during a recent visited to Chicago. I was very happy with my margherita pizza, it had just the right amount of cheese and sauce and was nicely presented. My friend very much enjoyed her order of tortellini. The server was friendly and made us feel very welcome. We would definitely visit here again.
My husband and I are regular customers at Quartino. We just love the atmosphere and friendly staff. It's a fine dining atmosphere with a family restaurant price. My husband tries something different every time we go (about twice a month) and so far has liked everything, but I'm stuck on the pizza Quattro Formaggi. Two thumbs up!
I love this place! It has that authentic, rustic Italian feel, in everything from the decor to the menu. The Veal Osso Bucco is probably my favorite dish here, and it's the best I've had anywhere. The lunch special is a great deal, too. Quartino is also a wonderful place to stop in and have some wine on the patio. Don't miss out on this one.
Quartino is definitely one of our favorite restaurants. When the weather is nice, there is nothing better than sitting on the balcony. The wait staff always has a smile and very helpful. I never once had to ask for a refill on my drink, they were really on top of the service. The food was amazing. The menu has a lot of options for everyone to find something they like. We will be going back very soon.
My overall impression of Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab was very positive. The restaurant's atmosphere was very active and lively which I seemed to enjoy. I have no problem whether if the restaurant is busy or not. The customers also seem to really enjoy the specials of the restaurant and the prime steak. The cook always does a good job so rarely customers bring up any problems. This restaurant does a fantastic job.
Wow! My friends had been talking about Quartino's, but I had never been. I finally went last night with a couple of friends. I have definitely been missing out! The atmosphere is fun and exiting and the staff is friendly and go out of their way to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. The food? It was to die for. Perfection. Definitely a 5 star experience for me. I'll be back, and often!
All I have to say is WOW! after visiting Quartino in downtown Chicago. The menu was rustic and everything I tried I loved! As an olive aficionado, that was my favorite part! The service was speedy and professional. It's a good wait staff when you hardly know they're there unless they are helping you out specifically. We stopped by on a Tuesday, which was disappointing since my party wanted the half-off wine deal. Nevertheless, a GREAT experience at Quartino Chicago. I would go back in a heartbeat, or faster!
My husband and I decided to try Quartino for dinner one night recently while his parents and sister were visiting, and it was wonderful. The dining room was very open and had a lively atmosphere. The decor was vintage and cute, and the retuarant smells like heaven as soon as you walk in the door. The food was amazing, the tortellini was some of the best I've ever had, my husband kept trying to steal it off my plate! The menu even had some vegetarian options listed, which made my sister-in-law very happy. The staff was friendly and quick. It was a great night and my husband and I will definitely be coming back soon!
The Signature Room was just as classy as we expected, with the amazing skyline view that is literally second to none. I would have been perfectly fine just to sit there and enjoy the view, but the food was out of this world as well. I ordered the Petit Filet and it was cooked to perfection just how I ordered it. I'm no meat expert, but it must have been a great cut because it was the best steak I've had in a long time. I highly recommend this place to anyone either looking to impress or that simply has the highest standards of quality on their own.
Wow. I had an incredible night at the Signature Room. Me and my boyfriend showed up 30 minutes late for out reservation, but the hostess was so nice! She gave us a table and didn't even mention our faux-pas. I got the halibut that was like heaven on a plate and my bf got the snapper. It was our three year anniversary and when our server Brian found out, he brought us two complimentary flutes of champagne and a free dessert. I mean, what? Best service ever. This place is incredibly expensive, but it's perfect for a special event.
Recently i had the extreme pleasure of being able to eat out at The Signature Room at the 95th. While i don't tend to treat myself to often, I had heard great things about this restaurant from a coworker of mine and decided to try it. I can honestly say that it didn't just meet my expectations, it blew them out of the water. The view is one of the first things you notice, a spectacular skyline view of the city, especially gorgeous at night with all of the lights shining. The staff we're all very professional and polite, even giving me some great suggestions on what wine would go well with my dish. The menu was simple, clean, and elegant. The table sets were also rather pretty. While slightly on the pricey side, my Manhattan steak was cooked to a medium perfection, and my dinner experience was one of the best of my entire life. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in some premier dining.
I visited the Signature Room this evening to enjoy a 10th anniversary dinner with my husband. I couldn't ask for a better view- the restaurant overlooks the city streets of Chicago. We were seated especially close to the gigantic, encompassing windows. I dined on the Grilled Tofu. I was especially pleased to see so many readily-made-vegan options. Many restaurants require you to call in advance if you have such strict dietary restrictions, but luckily (since I did not mention when calling), Signature Room's menu featured many vegetarian options, and a few vegan ones. The food was magnificent- beautiful, delicious, flavorful. I was a little reluctant to eat it, but only because I wanted to have my cake and eat it too! I would recommend this place for any special occasion.
I went to The Signature Room at the 95th last Friday for a relaxing dinner for two with my girlfriend and was greeted with impeccable service and hospitality from the wait staff. We sat down and ordered an appetizer and an entree each. For the appetizer, we had the Duck Trio. The duck thigh was cooked perfectly, but the toast points were a bit soggy. They must have been sitting out for a few before coming to the table. Other than that very minor detail, the rest of the appetizer was fantastic. For dinner I had the rack of lamb while my girlfriend had the petit filet. My lamb was cook perfectly. The lamb was juicy and full of flavor and the sides complimented the lamb just beautifully. I didn't have the chance to try the petit fillet myself, but my girlfriend absolutely loved it. For dessert, we shared the passionfruit cheesecake. It was light and fluffy and the crust was amazing. I would definitely go back and eat there again.
The Signature Room is an experience that is well worth your time. The ambient atmosphere is astounding. The view is breathtaking. The food is superb although a bit pricey. Customer satisfaction seems to be the key word here. The staff go out of their way to insure that you have a pleasant and memorable dining experience.
I would rate this restaurant a 4 out of 5. I went here for a romantic dinner last week with my wife. The view is breathtaking, and the food is just as spectacular. We started our night off with the Grilled Shrimp appetizer. Simply amazing. I then ordered the Wagyu Manhattan Strip Steak and my wife ordered the Petit Filet. We both enjoyed our meal, and found it to be quite a delicious experience. Oh, and I forgot to mention the service. Boy, these people sure are friendly. And they're quick too. I would definitely go to this restaurant again for a special occasion. Thank you Signature Room at the 95th for this lovely experience!
I absolutely love Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab! The first time I went there was with my friend who invited me and I can't get enough of it ever since. The restaurant itself is very elegant but the atmosphere is still very laid back and enjoyable. The food is delicious. My favorite dish is the Filet Mignon. You really do get a bang for your buck at this place because not only is the great but the service is also excellent and fast.
My husband and I treated ourselves to an intimate dinner date at the Signature Room to celebrate our wedding anniversary. What a treat it was. I had the Lamb, and my husband the Veal. We also added a side of vegetables. The food was delicious; fresh wonderfully flavored, cooked to perfection and served with a creative flair. The portions left us satiated, so much so we had to force ourselves to share a dessert. The staff helped us pair our meal with complimenting wines. We felt like royalty sitting atop the John Hancock Center looking over the lights of the city. I don't hesitate to recommend The Signature Room for any special occasion and look forward to our next excuse to dine there. We noted on the menu that the restaurant supports a different charity each month!
My husband and I recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at The Signature Room at the 95th. We made a reservation weeks in advance using their online reservation tool. The process was incredibly easy and user friendly. We arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early and were greeted by a very friendly and respectful hostess. She showed us our table, a private affair in the back corner of the facility. The table settings were beautiful and the overall atmosphere was elegant and exactly what we were looking for. The hostess gave us our menus and politely informed us who our server would be that evening. Our server was a well dressed young man who was polite and articulate. He made a few suggestions on what to choose and helped us with wine pairings. After ordering, he respectfully left us alone. It was lovely to spend time with my husband in such a formal atmosphere, it made our evening something very memorable. When presented with our food I was very impressed with how beautiful the presentation was! It was stunning, so artfully plated, I almost did not want to eat it! The taste and quality of the food can not be compared to anything I've had before. It was delicious! The suggested wine paired wonderfully with the dish as well. Our night went better than I could have hoped. The staff and food at The Signature Room at the 95th met and exceeded my expectations! five stars!
Oh my goodness i love love love this restaurant and have told everyone i know about my experience. The decor is beautiful and the view left me speechless. And the dessert was to die for i had their Passion fruit cheesecake and fell in love.This is a place I can spend hours at.
Last night was my boyfriend and I's second anniversary, and I knew he would do something special for it. He brought me to The Signature Room at the 95th, which I've always wanted to check out, but have never felt I had the time! We were greeted in a prompt and genuinely friendly manner upon approaching, and ushered to a window seat with an incredible view in the blink of an eye. We had arrived just in time for brunch, which is my favorite meal of the day. After inspecting our options, I settled on the Brie and Pear Quiche, while my boyfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict. We ordered coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice to enjoy while we waited, and they came quickly. The juice did indeed taste fresh, and the coffee was hot and one of the best cups I've had in a long time. Our breakfast arrived in a reasonable time frame, and everything was better than expected. The staff were friendly and efficient, making sure we had everything we needed without overly hovering. My favorite part was discovering they have a focus on sustainability, buy their meats locally, and give back to the community through philanthropic endeavors. I'd give this restaurant 5 out of 5 stars, hands down, and plan to return frequently in the future.
This Chicago restaurant is a diamond in the rough. My husband and I went to the Signature Room for brunch one Sunday after recommendations from a friend. I had the steak and eggs which was delicious. It was moist and cooked to perfection. My husband had the buttermilk pancakes, which I tasted from his plate. They were fluffy and delicious. I knew what I was ordering for our next brunch. As for the atmosphere, the ambiance is very sophisticated, a classy affair. Wait time is as to be expected for a gem as this. I would definitely go again!
My experience while at the Signature room was very pleasant. The dining service was excellent and the view from atop the tower was amazing. The best part was the elegance of the environment. I do wish to return again because of the positive experience I had.
My husband and I love coming to the Signature room at the 95th. It has a wonderful atmosphere of professionalism and it's a great place for one to celebrate a number of occasions. The food is wonderful and beautiful. The Twin Lobster Tails are to die for! I recommend trying that if you haven't. The staff is extremely polite, courteous and just wonderful. This is a must if you're visiting the area.
On Saturday, June 15,2013 My friends and i had the pleasure of visiting "The Signature Room At The 95th." The restraunt is reminiscant of a scene you would see out of a 40"s gangster movie,with its silk table cloths, fine crystal wine glasses, and fresh cut roses on every table. The Signature Room At The 95 Th has an equally classic menu from hand cut steaks, to more intricate stuffed fillet mignon, to simple desserts, to flombe there is something on the menu to appease even the most finicky of pallets.I ordered a steak medium rare, with a greek salad and chose a cabernet sauvignon from italy from the extensive windlist, that features italian and german red and white wines.The signature Room at the 95th, features classic entrees with a diversisified selection of wine , sure to appease everyone on a Saturday night,when the only question im hungey, where do we go? The answer of course is The Sigature Room At the 95th.
As a new customer visiting "The Signature Room at the 95th" I must say that I am not only thrilled with the experience, but also extremely happy with the high level of service I received. The floor to ceiling windows that allowed us to view the Chicago skyline was absolutely gorgeous, I feel lucky to have had this experience! The amount of variety on the menu is exquisite, and the pricing was not as high as I expected! I was shocked! A semi-reasonably priced, delicious, clean, well-mannered restaurant! I have been raving to all of my friends and family about this restaurant, and we are planning a family trip to visit not only Chicago, but this restaurant as well! I highly recommend this restaurant, although if you're afraid of heights I would ask for a table further away from the windows! It could be intimidating to those with issues with height!
I took my wife to The Signature Room for our 10th anniversary dinner after hearing great reviews from a friend who dined here at a wedding reception. Turns out his recommendation was spot on! We were stunned by the views of the city and even more impressed by the service. The staff went out of their way to treat my wife like a queen after I tipped them off that it was our anniversary which made our night even more special. While the atmosphere alone was worth the trip, I can't review The Signature without mentioning the food! My beef filet was delicious and the oysters are the best we've found yet in Chicago. If you're deciding between side dishes, I HIGHLY recommend trying the black truffle potatoes. After sampling mine my wife wished she had decided to splurge and get some of her own instead of opting for a more standard vegetable dish. To sum up: If you are looking for a place to celebrate a special event with loved ones or friends, I think that The Signature is a top-notch restaurant choice that will undoubtedly do your celebration justice.
Me and my wife ate at Joe's last weekend and the service was the best we've ever had. We ordered the crab legs and the the ribeye, and I must say that my steak was cooked to perfection and the crab legs were great. We definitely will be returning to this restaurant in the near future.
If you want something a little better than Joe's Crabshack, try Joe's Seafood, Prime steak & stone crab. The dining area and service was excellent with well dressed staff, who were all very polite. The prices might seem a little high but the amount and quality of food is worth it. All types of fresh seafood and great steaks are served in a variety of dishes that come full of deliciousness. With such a wide selection and great meals Joe's seafood is definitely worth checking out.
I was recently in Chicago for a convention. A friend recommended that I visit The Signature Room At The 95th.It is probably one of the best recommendations a person has ever given me. The Signature Room At The 95th is an amazing restaurant it overlooks the city of Chicago. I ordered the Spiced Duck Breast for dinner the dish was mouthwatering and had an authentic taste. I also ordered a glass of wine to go with the dish. The food and the view of Chicago added to the moment, it was spectacular. The overall feel and environment of the restaurant is luxurious, the waiters and waitresses are friendly and both knowledgeable. I recommend The Signature Room At The 95th to anyone seeking the best of Chicago.
I highly recommend The Signature Room for any visitor to Chicago. It gives you a great view of the entire surrounding city. The drinks are a bit pricey, but you're mostly paying for the view & atmosphere, which is fairly upscale. It is a chill lounge which is relatively quiet and a great place to chat or hang out after dinner. The line can get long, but it moves at a decent speed.
The Signature Room is on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Building, and although I'm not one for heights, I soon forgot about that, looking down at the bright lights of Chicago. The restaurant is comfortable and cozy with it's wood decor, and the service was fast and friendly, the restaurant being family-owned. I ordered the Filet of Beef, which was worth every penny ($50) and was made even more mouth-watering by the side dish of Roasted Mushrooms and Truffles Vinaigrette I ordered($5). The potato galette, wild greens salad, and oxtail pot-au-feu that came with the steak was really something to remember, and went well with the fine bottle of Beaujolais. (My mother was a waitress for 35 years, and I could find nothing to complain about, and always leave a 15% tip.) This is a great place to bring a date or larger party to make an impression not soon forgotten!
I love Joe's Seafood. I am a seafood enthusiast and have been to every seafood restaurant in the Chicago area, and Joe's is the best by a longshot! Their seafood is fresh and always tastes like it was just pulled from the ocean. Their dishes compliment the seafood perfectly and taste as if it were served by Posiden himself, haha! But really, it's the best. Their prices are more then fair for the quality of food and service you receive at Joe's. Everytime I have company visiting me I take them to Joe's and they always agree with me that it's the best seafood they have ever tasted!
We went to Mike Ditka's - Chicago restaurant. It was great. My husband got the sushi and I got crab cakes. They were both very good. The restaurant was also very clean. We will be going back to the restaurant soon to try out their other food.
For Fathers day I received a gift card to Ditka's, a restaurant owned by former Chicago Bears Head Coach Mike Ditka. I was excited to try it out and went last night. I made a reservation for the Chicago location through the website (this was very easy to do). When we got there I immediately took notice of the decor, which was very visually appealing to me. Service was quick to take our orders. I got the Alaskan Halibut, my wife the Lake Perch. Both arrived to our table quickly. The portions were large and I had to get a too go bag! We were so full we decided to skip dessert. The prices were fair. Overall I would rate the place an 8/10 and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
Ditka's restaurant was a delightful experience. The entrance to this restaurant was very inviting and the staff welcomed us with a smiled.The servers are professional and worked in a timely matter to receive our orders. The menus had clear images that were enticing to my appetite. I ordered the BBQ baby back ribs that were mouth watering. They were falling off the bone. They were sweet and tender. Cooked to perfection. My side order of spinach salad was a fresh delight. It contained crunchy bacon and slices of egg, and sweet slices of apples. The ambiance in this restaurant was great,subtle music playing in the back ground, people laughing and conversing.The food was delicious and service outstanding with servers always checking in to see if we needed anything. A great experience and will be coming back again.
Being a big football Chicago Bears, my friends and I decided to go to Mike Ditka's - Chicago. Wow, we were amazed by this place! We went and had dinner at 8:00pm on a Friday night, I called and made reservations ahead of time. We started with drinks, I am a big fan of Moscow Mule's. This one did not disappoint me at all! The server was great, from drinks to dinner she was very helpful! We started appetizers with the Calamari, and for the first time I had it Rhode Island Style. I cant say that I'm a big fan of this, but it was great to try something new. I then had the prime meatloaf stack, being from the south I love meatloaf! This was so good, that I had to take a picture and post it on Facebook...YUM! Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well. All and all this was a 5/5 experience, and I will differently come back!
Ditka's in Chicago has certainly impressed me. Usually when I take the time to write a review its because I am extremely unhappy. The food was nearly inedible, the wait staff spilled a drink on my wife "accidentally" or the roach in the potatoes was the only thing appetizing. None of this happened at Ditka`s in Chicago. It never will happen either as the food is of the highest quality. I had Dry-Aged Angus Prime Rib with Mike's Fries. I wanted the most All American meal I could order and that was it. I wolfed it down like William Perry circa 1985 and I will say it was the greatest piece of meat I have ever had in my life. The potatoes were like a touchdown in my mouth with every bite. Ditka`s is truly the Super Bowl of food and the winner is you. I wish I had saved room for Overtime as I imagine their dessert is as good as the entree. I will definitely be back at the Goaline at Ditka`s for another Championship Dinner.
Mike Ditka's restaurant in Chicago is amazing! My husband and I do not go out together all that often due to conflicting schedules but we decided on this place because of the atmosphere it portrayed and we were incredibly impressed. It is a beautiful place that makes you feel comfortable as soon as you walk in. It is clean and the smells were mouth watering. The staff was personable and greeted us with smiles which is something many service industries are lacking these days. We were seated without too much of a wait. Our waiter came to take our drink orders after only a minute or two and the drinks were ready right away. We ordered the fresh calamari to start. I am a HUGE calamari fan and this was some of the best I have had. It was hot, fresh, crispy and to die for. I would go back for that alone! I also had the spinach salad which had bacon and eggs and a delicious dressing. It was excellent and fresh. We shared the seafood platter which was plenty of food for the both of us after our appetizers and it was all so fresh I was shocked. Normally when you get seafood out it is hit or miss. Either it is fresh and wonderful or it isn't and it can break the whole experience. But Mike's is a place that a highly recommend for their exceptional service as well as their superb cuisine. We will certainly be going back! Our waiter got a great tip!
I recently went to Mike Ditka's - Chicago for dinner with friends, it was my first trip to the restaurant. Overall I enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the food was delicious and the waitstaff was courteous and friendly. I would recommend Mike Ditka's - Chicago to a friend. The atmosphere immediately caught my attention as I arrived. I am an avid sports fan, I found the restaurant's ambiance to be very exciting. There was a lot of very interesting pictures, posters and sports memorabilia decorating the restaurant. It's really any Chicago sports lover's dream! I was really impressed with the food. I had a Prime Filet Mignon with a loaded twice baked potato. The chef did a great job of cooking my steak exactly how I ordered it, medium rare. My meal was a little bit costly but the food itself was outstanding. Our waitress did a great job of getting my food out to me quickly so it did not end up sitting under a heat lamp for a long time drying out. If you are a sports fan and you enjoy steak, Mike Ditka's - Chicago is definitely a restaurant you will want to visit. I will be back to try some of the other delicious sounding items on the menu like the burgers, ribs and seafood. Despite the price, I was completely satisfied with my meal, it was worth every penny. I am looking forward to my next visit to Mike Ditka's - Chicago.
I recently went to Chicago to visit an old family friend who needed my help. While I was there, they suggested we go out to eat at Mike Ditka's. I was surprised at the speed with which we were helped. There was a small line, but we got our table extremely quickly, and were promptly greeted by our server. He suggested some specials, took our drink orders, and left us to peruse the menu. Shortly after we had decided, the waiter returned and gave us some complimentary bread, then took our orders. I had decided to order the Angus Prime Rib, and my friend ordered the Filet Mignon Two Ways. Our food came out much faster than I had expected, and was delicious! I had originally thought the price was steep for what I was getting, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the portion size was very generous. It would have been worth it for the flavor of the food alone. My steak was done to absolute perfection, the very definition of medium-rare. My friend's steak was likewise pristine. I got to try a bit of his order as well, and was again taken aback by how delicious it was. All in all, our experience was absolutely spectacular. I would give them 5/5 stars for service, cleanliness, helpfulness, flavor, and portion size. Unfortunately, I didn't see any desserts, which was a shame as I would have enjoyed getting to hang out a little longer in the warm, inviting environment of the restaurant. I will definitely be visiting again, and will be suggesting to anyone in the area: Visit Mike Ditka's, you will not be disappointed!
Joe's is my favorite place to relax after work. The bartender there makes great cocktails and when I get hungary, I like to have their classic cheeseburger at the bar. The seafood here is really good, especially the stone crabs. My wife likes the grilled tomatoes and Ahi Tuna, which has a wasabi kick. Service is fast and attentive, but the waiters also know how to let you be when you want. They don't hover. The decor is classic, but updated. . .dark wood, white linens, soft lighting and black and white photos on the wall. On weekends, this place really heats up, but I like to come on weeknights when it's less crowded.
I had the luxury of dining with friends at Mike Ditka's in Chicago. Wow! What a place! You will surely want to make reservations just to make sure you're not left out. We did and there was no standing around when we got there. When you first walk in, the decor is truly amazing. We had a nicely set table in one area of the dining room. There are many different areas including some private rooms as well. Our waiter was superb! I really think he would have even cut our steaks for us. For starters, I had the Maryland crab cake. I am a crab cake-aholic, so I'm always looking for the best ones and I think I've found it. It was perfectly broiled with the best crab meat - no shells or cartilege in this one! Next, not being too adventurous, I ordered the chicken noodle soup. I told you I wasn't adventurous. How can you possibly make chicken soup any better? This is just like your grandma makes. Big chunks of real chicken, carrots, and celery were in this soup. For the entree, I love a good steak, so I ordered the Filet Mignon Two ways. One is done up Oscar-style with asparagus and bernaise sauce and the other was encrusted with horseradish around the edges. Ordering it medium was absolutely the way to go. The Oscar-style was phenomenal! The horseradish encrusted can stand on its own. A friend and I shared the fresh broccoli, which was perfectly cooked, not too crunchy and not too mushy. What an awesome meal we had. This was certainly worth the price, although in Chicago, this is a real bargain. I would highly recommend that you make Mike Ditka's your next night out!
My wife and I decided to try this place out as we pass by all the time but haven't ever gone in. Boy, are we glad we did! The service was excellent, the atmosphere was perfect, and the food was fantastic! Try the meatloaf stack, you'll love it.
My boyfriend had been wanting to try Mike Ditka's for a while, so I finally agreed to go. The restaurant is clean and has a nice atmosphere. We didn't have to wait long to be given a table and our food arrived right away. I had the crispy tuna avacado roll, while my boyfriend had the prime ribs. The food was amazing! It was fresh and was well prepared. My boyfriend said his ribs were cooked perfectly. The meal was affordable and the whole experience was good. I definitely plan to come back.
The service at Ditka's restaurant was not too fast or slow. I had the Iron Mike burger and it was AWESOME! One of the best burgers I have ever had. I was come back here for sure, just for the burger alone and hope to try some wine the next time I visit.
All I can say is WOW! I went to this restaurant last week with some friends and I had such a wonderful time. The atmosphere was super comfortable and the wait staff was extremely friendly. The steak I ordered was cooked to perfection and all of the sides were wonderful! My friend's salmon plate smelled really tasty too. I just wish I could have tried everything on the menu ;) The priced were very reasonable too. I would definitely recommend Mike Ditka's to everyone. I cannot wait to return with more of my friends and family. - Clean - Friendly - Reasonably Priced - Fast Service - Perfect Food
i am not a person who normally writes review, but after going to this restaurant i cant stop myself from writing some words about it. quality of food and quick service are two main reason to recommend this restaurant to my friends. a good news is that they have some promotions also for drinks on sometimes, so you can enjoy your good food for little less value.
I have gone to Mike Ditka's Chicago with a couple of friends and boy, didn't I imagine it would be more than a blast! I enjoyed the ambiance- it was friendly and at the same time classy. You cannot define the word class, but you can definitely go to one. They offer private dining, which is my next target visit. Once will never be enough for an outstanding experience.
Wow! Mike Ditka's in Chicago is one of my favorite restaurants, it's seriously amazing. They have the best steak I've ever had, cooked to perfection and seasoned amazingly. I go to this place all the time, and every experience is incredible. The waiters and staff are all very nice, and are there to make sure that you have a great time. Their variety of meats are amazing, and almost every entree is on point. I personally love their steaks, but everything on the menu is good. I got to say, this place is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone.
When I heard that Mike Ditka was opening a steakhouse, I knew I had to try it. The man is a legend in Chicago and is known for giving 100% to whatever he puts his time in. When I went in the restaurant I really liked what I saw. It was a very relaxed place, not too loud and not too quiet. The people and the staff were friendly as well so my initial impressions were good. But at the end it is all about the food. The steaks were great, my order was on time, and I had a really good time. I recommend anyone who likes good steak to check the place out!
I took my wife to dinner last Friday at Ditkaao>>s in Chicago. The place was busy, but the staff was on top of it and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server was friendly (sorry, I forgot her name) and had our drinks quickly. My wife had the Maryland Style Crab Cakes and she says they are the best she has ever had. I had the huge Ditka Cut Bone-in Angus Prime Rib. Not only was it big, but it had to be the best prime rib I've had in a very long time. The food and service rates a solid 10 while the atmosphere was closer to a 9. The prices are on the steep side, but it was well worth it.
I had been to Joe's out in Vegas once before I came to Chicago, and was very fond of it. The Joe's in Chicago is one of the best restaurants I have been to in years. They featured a full wine list which included some great Merlot. My fiance and I started off with the '2nd Mortgage' featuring Alaskan King Crab, Shrimp and Scallops which was incredible. The Rib-eye steak I got for dinner was cooked to perfection and was rubbed with the perfect about of spices and pepper. I'm not one to 'lick my plate clean', but it was hard to put down my fork. Joe's is highly recommended and, if you can, save room for dessert, the Key-Lime pie was fantastic.
I visited Mike Ditka's Chicago location the other night and was highly impressed with the restaurant. This location, in the Tremont hotel, has a great atmosphere and a very courteous staff. I went with a small group for dinner and we decided to try out several items on the menu to share. The Seafood Tower and Coach's Pot Roast Nachos were a big hit with our group. For my meal I got the Kobe Burger which was cooked as requested and very juicy. The side of fries I got was also good, though I was pretty full from all the rest of the food and didn't finish them. I would definitely visit Mike Ditka's again for the ambiance and the delicious food.
My family of 4 visited Ditka's restaurant in Chicago for lunch for the first time, and we weren't disappointed. Although the establishment was busy, our wait for a table was minimal. Service was very prompt, which is a must when dining with kids! My husband and I found the lunch menu to be extensive and we were happy with the selection of beer. The salads were fresh and our burgers were prepared to our liking. Even our picky kids liked their food. And most importantly, when the bill came, we found our total to be reasonable, given the amount of food and drinks that we ordered. This is a great stop for tourists, and the next time we are in Chicago, we will be sure to stop in again!
The Purple Pig is by far one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The food and wine are amazing and the customer service is excellent. I will definitely be eating here again! Five Stars!!!
Very professional, inviting atmosphere. What struck me most about The Purple Pig was not necessarily its food, but the presentation. The food was great, but what really sold me on this restaurant was the way the owners and the employees presented themselves. Everybody with whom we interacted was very polite (some were quite sociable, and in a positive way), yet the decor and the architecture really painted an atmosphere of great energy and liveliness that fit the city around me.
Great place, great environment, great service. I enjoyed my time at the Purple Pig and I will return soon. It may be cliche to say, but all of the wasted time spent at other restaurants is painful to think about. Being an adventurous soul, I ordered the Calamari. I have never tried it and The Purple Pig delivered. This was an attractive and appetizing plate with a taste that did not disappoint. The staff were helpful, prompt and proper. I will return again soon.
What more can I possibly say but this: WOW! The Purple Pig was absolutely amazing! Very contemporary and modern styling was definitely on point. Selection of wines and cheeses were exactly what I expected. Prices were reasonable and were definitely not above the industry norm. Quiet, relaxing atmosphere. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and had sampled every dish to add to his knowledge. I would definitely recommend The Purple Pig to anyone!
I had read plenty about this restaurant in various restaurant reviews including Time Out Chicago and the Chicago Tribune. I was a bit hesitant because sometimes they never live up to the hype. But, I have to admit, the Purple Pig is really fantastic. First, the atmosphere is very tasteful, decorated with nice colors, and even the dishes are in the shape of pigs. The food was just fantastic. I was a bit overwhelmed by the choices of cheeses and wines, but our server was very knowledgeable and helped us to get match our wines with out meals and to choose some of the more popular dishes. I look forward to going back and trying some of the salads, which also looked amazing. And, when we left, we realized there is some outdoor seating for when the weather is good! Can't wait to return!
I went to the Purple Pig restaurant on friday night with my brother and his wife. It was their first time visiting Chicago so of course they wanted to eat somewhere downtown. I have to admit i'm not a big fan of charcuterie but on the advice of a friend we decided to try the Purple Pig, and I'm glad we did. Great and friendly staff who treat you like family from the minute you open the door(which is rare for a downtown restaurant). We were initially seated near the kitchen door, I then asked if we could have a table near the front window they switched us with no problems. The star of the night was the menu. For anyone who thinks this is just a pork restaurant think again. Huge selection of menu items for a variety of different tastes. I had the salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese, and one of the best deviled eggs i have ever eaten. Our table had two excellent bottles of rioja wine. I would definitely recommend Purple Pig. Trust me, you will be pleasantly suprised.
I had heard about The Purple Pig for a while and the chefs associated with it and wanted to try it out. Granted having the motto of "Cheese, Swine and Wine" didn't hurt! So I grabbed a friend and made plans. We decided to head over on Sunday afternoon to give it a test run. I had to start with the Pork Fried Almonds - how could anything fried with pork be bad. It wasn't. My friend loved the chorizo stuffed olives (the stuffing tasted great but I'm not an olive fan). I did swipe a taste of the deviled eggs and will definitely order them next time for myself. After some good conversation, I ordered the meatball sliders and my companion ordered the porchetta. It comes with salsa verde and she was really surprised at how much she liked the salsa. My meatball sliders were awesome on a taste scale. We both agreed that for some casual tastings, all the food impressed and we would definitely come back another time to try the fancier dishes.
Eating at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab Restaurant is an outstanding dinner. The wait staff are all at the top of their game remembering every little detail we requested with ease. The Spinach Stuffed Mushroom Caps were a definite restaurant specialty on the appetizer menu. We absolutely had to try the Stone Crabs that the restaurant is known for, and were delighted with the quality and freshness. They made a great addition to the Filet Mignon which was juicy and tender and seared to perfection. To top it all off we shared a Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge sauce for dessert and were delighted with rich taste! A definite go-to on our list!
If your making a trip to Chicago, definitely make a stop at the Purple Pig. Not only was the food delicious, but our wait staff was super nice and friendly. They didn't make me feel like a tourist, they made me feel at home. Absolute must visit!
Purple pig's employees are awesome! (5 star service). Menu is diverse and everything tastes great! Ambiance is fantastic. It is a place where you can bring your love ones and friends. I will definitely recommend and come back soon.
The Purple Pig in Chicago is located in a beautiful location downtown near the river and proves to be one of the premier dining locations in the city. Upon arriving at the Purple Pig, we were greeted by the hostess and immediately brought to our table. At first glance, the menu is overwhelming with a large variety of fantastic sounding dishes. For an appetizer we decided on the calamari and it was delicious. The calamari were fried perfectly leading to a crisp and crunchy texture and a nice, juicy flavor. The fregula and radishes that came on the side were a nice touch. I then decided to order wine from the vast and exotic wine list with a selection that is sure to please all wine connoisseurs. It was then time to order dinner which was difficult with all the different menu options. I decided on the meatball slider with Parmesan and arugula and it was to die for. The meatballs were tender and succulent with a great flavor. The marinara was also done well as it was just slightly sweet and of the perfect texture. The rolls on which the sliders came on were fresh baked and toasted to a nice crisp. For desert, it had to be Grandma D's chocolate cake which was, like the rest of the meal, delicious. The cake was moist and full of flavor and was a perfect ending to an excellent meal. Overall I would give The Purple Pig four stars out of four with great service, great food, and a great wine list. It is pricey, but the quality of the food reflects the prices an then some. It is now one of my favorites in the Chicago area.
Anyone who has traveled will agree that finding suitable cuisine is nearly always a challenge. Big cities, such as Chicago, have a wide variety of different restaurants and diners all of which promising a unique dining experience. My family and I had heard about the classy restaurant named The Purple Pig from friends that had traveled there on business trips. The interior was beautifully decorated as was the outside of the restaurant. The hostess was very gracious as was the waitress, going above and beyond to ensure that our needs were met completely. Our food came out in a very timely manner. I ordered the Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic. It was absolutely exquisite. The meat was so tender that it melted in your mouth with a unique spin. My husband and I had white wine, so smooth that it just glided down our throats. We will definitely be back the next time that we are in Chicago and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a thrill of the taste buds.
I have been to this restaurant, it is one of my most favorite restaurant, I like their Porch Etta Panini, this restaurant is one of the best maker's of delicious recipes of Pork. They have vide varieties of Mediterranean foods. I also like their roasted bone-marrow. I think this is one of the delicious restaurant for Pork Specialties. They are the Expertise of attracting the customers with their highly expert hospitality. I would definitely recommend and also take my friends there for the weekend parties.
Where do I start? The Purple Pig is absolutely incredible seems about right. I first went with a couple of coworkers for dinner on a Friday night and felt as if I stumbled upon a gold mine. Its location is perfect for taking a client or a date. The Good Stuff: - The food is delicious. I have yet to try something I did not like. - The "plating" is done with great care and is incredibly appealing. - The wait staff is professional with the perfect amount of friendliness. - Dessert! Unbelievable! Don't skip dessert! The bad: - What do I write? I have yet to find anything bad! The Purple Pig is awesome. Try it. You'll understand.
I started my evening out with an appetizer. I went with the broccoli with roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette. It had the perfect amount of flavor and balance. I ended my night with Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin Breadcrumbs. I was recommended this dish and it delivered. The pork tripe was cooked to perfection which bares repeating because it is easily messed up. The service was great, our server was very helpful and accommodating.
What a great find! I went to this restaurant with my hubby yesterday and was totally satisfied. The decor was whimsical and fun. The wine list was extensive and the wait staff knowledgable about it. And the food...it was really amazing. We had the chorizo stuffed olives, which were savory and delicious, along with an assortment of cured meats and cheeses the waiter suggested. Then, we shared the clams. They were sooo good, especially sopping up the juices with the rustic bread. I really wanted to try the lemon panna cotta, but I was so full it just wasn't an option. I will definitely get it the next time I go, though, which will be very soon!
My wife and I decided to eat at The Purple Pig the other night, since one of my friends suggested it to me. Our first impression as we entered the restaurant was how beautiful the interior looked. The atmosphere was definitely fit for a date night with a significant other. The restaurant had a variety of wine to choose from. I chose a bottle of red wine from Spain but do not remember what it was called. My wife and I enjoyed it but that was just the beginning. The food there was amazing to say the least. My wife ordered the slow roasted ham panini and she said it was the best panini she had ever tasted. I had always enjoyed Mediterranean food and luckily it was the restaurant's specialty. I had the chicken thigh kebabs with fried smash potatoes and it did not disappoint. The price was reasonable and the food was off the charts. Although the service was average, I had nothing to complain about. I would definitely recommend The Purple Pig to my friends. Good food, great wine, a 10 out of 10 in my book.
I was very impressed with The Purple Pig. The food was delicious, we had Antipasti, with Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic which melted in your mouth. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys eating good food in a great restaurant. The service was excellent, fast and friendly and the price was just right. You won't be sorry that you stopped at "The Purple Pig" to eat!
My Wife and I just got home from the most romantic and great tasting dinner I have had in many years. We went to Joe's Seafood. The atmosphere there was out of this world and the service was top notch. We were greeted and seated really quickly. When I made the reservation, It was quick and easy. They took our drink order immediately and we received our Sweat tea's with 5 mins. We then Ordered our food and got it within 15 minutes. We both ordered the Fathers Day special. The taste was out of this world and we had leftovers to take home. The server always seemed concerned with how we were doing and our drinks were always full. This place has great service, Great food and I love the atmosphere.
When I arrived at the restaurant I was immediately surprised by how good the smell and the lighting was. I ordered the NV Nicolas Feuillatte Brut which was very nice and priced fairly.The server was very courteous and catered to all my our needs. I would definitely go back again!
I decided to treat myself to something special. I'd heard my friends talk about and decided to grab the wife and finally check out The Purple Pig. We arrived at 6pm, trying to beat the dinner rush. Luckily there was plenty of room and we did not have to wait. Antonio was our server for the evening. His uniform was clean and well fitted. We shared the kale and romaine caesar salad to start. It was good and the anchovy did not overpower the rest of the dish. However my wife was not the biggest fan of the quail egg. For entree I had the olive-oil poached tuna and it was amazing. My wife had the ham and mushroom panini but only ate half. I of course finished it right up for her! Neither of us had wine(had to work in the morning) so I can't really comment there, though the wine list did look rather extensive. We paid for our dinner and as we were leaving Antonio said good night and invited us back in again. The place was clean, the staff friendly, and most importantly the food was good. We just might take Antonio up on that invitation.
I stopped in at the Purple Pig for lunch today, and had a great experience. The staff members were really friendly, and the food was terrific. This was my first time stopping at this restaurant, and I was really impressed with both the service and the food. I ordered the Meatball Slider with Parmesan & Arugula, and also treated myself to dessert (Affogato, which is soft ice cream with espresso over it). My slider was prepared perfectly, and the espresso was great (not too bitter). The prices were reasonable for the quality of the food. I definitely plan to go back, and soon!
We go to Shaw's sometimes for lunch. Usually have chicken sandwich. Prices are a little high but the food makes up for it. Service is always fast and friendly. Don't know about diner but for lunch you cant go wrong here.
Shaw's is definitely a neat place to grab a bite. I went right when they opened at 11:30 for lunch, and it was already wicked packed. Being from Boston I'm a huge fan of lobster rolls, and I really wanted to see if their rolls were good enough to stand up to MA's delights. Good news! The rolls were stuffed full of lobster (no skimping here) and had just the right amount of mayo to satisfy my craving. Fries were pretty good, and the service was lightning fast even though it was packed. I was only in the area for a conference, but if I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely stop by! Oh, and don't forget to try the pecan pie--totally worth it!
My husband and I had a very pleasant lunch at Shaw's yesterday. Upon our arrival, we were greeted with smiles and our reservation was located quickly. We were led to our table immediately and I was impressed at how clean and inviting the place was. Our order of Lobster Cocktails, Tuna Sushi/Asian Salad and the Crab Cake Burger was taken promptly. We sipped our drinks and enjoyed the quiet, upscale atmosphere while we waited. Before we knew it, our server was delivering our food. Unlike much of the seafood we have tried before, this was fresh and quite delicious! My salad was fresh as well. Overall, a delightful experience. We will be back often.
Shaw's Crab House is a fantastic experience all-around. The service is excellent. Our waitress, Sandy or Sally, I can't remember, was extremely solicitous and seemed to magically appear any time we needed something. The food was delicious. I couldn't believe the amount of crab legs that were in an order! We had crab claws as an appetizer, and I did my famous crab claw routine to my daughter's embarrassment, but no one seemed to mind, management included, when I walked around the restaurant with crab claws dangling from my ears, nostrils, and mouth. Good sports. The atmosphere, too, is tremendously welcoming, and I love the fact that you can arm-wrestle the chef for a free meal. What a fun place! We'll be coming back for sure. I can't recommend Shaw's highly enough.
My family and I heard some amazing things about Shaw's, so we decided to book a reservation and go out for a nice dinner together. We decided to go on a Saturday for dinner, and when we arrived the restaurant was bustling, but not chaotic. The hostess greeted us right away, and when we told her we had reservations we were immediately taken to our table that was already set up for us. The server greeted us right away and we placed an order for their Tuna Anaheim Tempura (highly recommended!) and wine. After a bit, we placed our orders for the main course, and it arrived promptly and hot and was absolutely delicious. Throughout the experience the wait staff were attentive, but not pushy, and the restaurant is beautiful and clean inside. I had a great experience, and highly recommend it!
I dined at Shaw's Crab House for the first time for Sunday Brunch last week, to celebrate a birthday. New to Chicago, I was looking for a place to get sea food done right, and I sure found it! Shaw's is fantastic! The ambiance is beautiful and welcoming, and makes you feel at home, as does the friendly staff. The brunch buffet was the best sea food buffet I have ever had. The selection was fantastic, and everything was cooked perfectly. The Alaskan King Crab Legs were the king of my plate, but I think I tried a little of everything. I am just glad they didn't have to roll me out of the restaurant! They also have a cold sea food bar, an omelet and waffle station, and breakfast cocktails. At $55 per person, Shaw's Crab House is a little on the pricey side. But for special occasions when you want to celebrate, it is worth it!
Shaw's Crab House- Chicago is anything but "Crabby". The whole staff from the hostess to the chef were extremely friendly and made my dining experience one to be remembered. There whole menu looked extremely appetizing, but I finally decided to start with the lobster cocktail. It was amazing, the cilantro chile sauce really gave it a nice, refreshing kick. I then opted for the parmesan crusted chicken. Again, it was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the breading was crunchy on the outside and the chicken was juicy on the inside. As far as the sauteed spinach..well let's just say I couldn't get enough of it! I don't know how I did it, but I ordered dessert as well. Shaw's Raspberry Pie! The raspberries tasted like they were fresh out of the garden. This restaurant will definitely get my business again!
Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab was amazing! First off, because I had never visited before and was only visiting Chicago as well, I wanted to check the menu online. I was not disappointed! Their full menu was available, with descriptions of each item. I tried the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms as an appetizer and the Seared Ahi Tuna Sandwich as my entree and was not disappointed! Both were delicious and cooked to perfection. The service was also fantastic. I received my food quickly and it was correct on the first try (something I never take for granted) and our waitress was courteous and attentive. It's like she knew I was thirsty before I did! Overall, I recommend this place to anyone in the area. It is well worth a try.
Shaw's Crab House is a new restaurant in Chicago that I would highly recommend to satisfy your next craving for a great seafood dinner. Last Friday night, I spotted the website at www.shawscrabhouse.com online, and was impressed with their tempting menu, the virtual tour, and the ease of making an online reservation. We arrived at Shaw's at 7:00 for dinner. The restaurant was crowded, but our reservation got us seated by a window within 5 minutes. The atmosphere is casual, and decorated in a pleasant decor with lots of beautiful wood and interesting marine art. The waiter arrived quickly and was friendly and knowledgeable. We all ordered the Alaskan Red Crab dinner, and our mouths watered as we enjoyed the succulent flavors. The entire meal was fresh, eye appealing and delicious. The cost was fair and well deserved. We all agreed that we would return to Shaw's Crab House again very soon.
If you're looking for the best seafood in Chicago, you have to go to Shaw's Crab House. The menu of items is endless and almost overwhelming. Not only does restaurant offer traditional seafood dishes and appetizers, but they also have an incredible sushi menu to choose from and to satisfy any seafood craving. The lobster, avocado and cucumber roll is my favorite. As for the rest of the menu, I've tried the Broiled Lake Michigan Whitefish and Grilled Alaskan Halibut and loved them both, and would easily recommend them to anyone. I would definitely order each again, but with so many plates to choose from, I also want to try them all. There are also non-seafood options if you're going out with people who do not prefer seafood, but honestly this place is best enjoyed by those who love seafood. The atmosphere is also incredible and so is the wait staff. You will surely have an incredible time at Shaw's and I would easily give the restaurant a 5/5.
Shaw's Crab House in Chicago is the perfect place to visit when you have a hankering for fresh, delicious seafood. Located just a few blocks from Chicago Harbor, Shaw's provides world-class dining in an upscale environment. I wore a jeans skirt and a nice top, and felt totally comfortable there. So it's not so fancy that you feel uncomfortable. Since I live in Chicago, I often show off the city to out-of-town friends over lunch. I usually suggest the hand-rolled maki (the spicy shrimp with salmon and lemon is the best!). For dinner, I like to order up a dozen half-shell oysters. Given the quality and the portion sizes, you'll find that It won't bust your budget. Another of my favorites is the authentic Broiled Lake Michigan Whitefish with the horseradish crust is another treat - and, again, it's reasonably priced. I also recommend checking out the sustainable seafood menu, which provides several selections you'll feed good about eating. I was too full to order dessert the last time I ate there, and I wish now that I had saved room. They have the BEST key lime pie, which I always love after eating sushi. Make sure you call ahead for a reservation. The restaurant is quite popular.
As a big fan of seafood, I've been dying to find a great but affordable seafood place in Chicago. Upon recommendation from a friend, I tried Shaw's Crab House -- and was definitely glad I did! The items on the menu are well within my budget... which means they should be well within anyone's budget! The quality of the service is excellent; my server was friendly and I didn't have to wait long at all. Factor that in with the quality of the food, and it goes without saying that I've been won over! I implore anyone looking for some excellent seafood without wanting to break the bank to check out Shaw's -- hopefully you'll be as surprised as I was.
I'm a big fan of seafood restaurants and this one did not disappoint. Everything from their sushi to their entrees is great - even the desserts are good! Great affordable place to take the family and it won't break your budget. Will definitely come back to this place.
Whether you are tourist looking to venture the Chicago nightlife, or an elegant seafood joint, Shaw's Crab House brings you the best of both worlds. Located near the Chicago Harbor, the restaurant is found near beautiful Chicago seaside. With a menu that ranges from soups, steaks, crab, and the best oysters in town, there is no better place to dine quality food at an unbeatable price. Born in the San Francisco Bay Area, i have had my fair share of seafood a the piers, but, I can easily say that it feels good to have great tasting seafood out on the east coast.Thank you Shaw's Crab House for the great experience and will definitely return next time i come to the windy city.
The most incredible seafood dishes are to be had at Shaw's. I love that they even serve sushi. Prices are well worth the visit and Sunday brunch is definitely worth checking out! Once you try a locally brewed coffee, you will never want to drink any other kind of coffee. Plus, the prices are less than a lot of other places that serve coffee blends.
Shaws Crabhouse had an excellent atmosphere and was just a cozy place. The waiter was nice and prompt getting our orders. I ordered the spider roll and my girlfriend ordered the battered alaskan halibut tacos. The sushi was very good and flavorful and my girlfriend really liked the fish tacos, they were savory and just plain good. I would recommend a seafood lover here anytime.
Shaw's Crab House is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. If you have family in town make sure and impress them by taking them to Shaw's. If you like Seafood Shaw's has it all, fresh oysters, crabs, and Sushi. Shaw's also has the best brunch in town. I love going during Sunday Brunch. The brunch is all buffet style and includes, eggs benedict, omelets, and fresh seafood. Come back for dinner and enjoy some of the best tuna in town. If you haven't tried Shaw's than you are missing out.
Interested in some surf and turf? Check out Shaw's Crab House on E. Hubbard St. in Chicago. Their vast menu displays the quality of the items that they serve. My dinner consisted of sushi, twin lobster tails, and a glass of red wine to wash it down. The lobster tasted like it was caught out of the ocean minutes before it entered my mouth. Shaw's also serves as a perfect spot to take that special person out. The gorgeous dining room and selection of fresh cuisine will be sure to impress your date.
I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. Although I have been eating snow and king crab my whole life, I had never tried stone crab before and was eager to. I started with the spinach stuffed mushrooms, and they were perfectly cooked- moist and well seasoned. I tried some of my husband's cole slaw, and will definitely order that on my next visit as well. The stone crabs were amazing! Since I hadn't tried them before, I decided to go for the medium size stone crabs. The light seasonings went very well with the delicious natural flavor of these unique crabs. My husband had the new york strip steak which was cooked to his order (rare! Not my style.) He said it was juicy and very full of flavor. We enjoyed an excellent dinner, and I cannot wait to find another reason to "celebrate" and head back here.
I love Shaw's. I go there all the time with friends and family. It is so good! I am always pleased with the service I receive, and the food is terrific. There is so much to choose from (large menu). The food is always fresh and delicious. Their dessert menu is outstanding, too. The location is quite convenient. If you're looking for a classy seafood restaurant in a great location in Chicago, then Shaw's is the place. I would highly recommend. Go for lunch and try the Parmesan Crusted George's Bank Haddock - it's to die for!
Shaw's Crab House was just what my girlfriend and I were looking for for our anniversary. They have everything here from seafood, to steak, to brunch. We entered the restaurant and were kindly greeted by the hostess who quickly took us to a very nice table. They even brought us a bottle of wine on the house because it was our anniversary! The waiter was prompt and polite. My girlfriend ordered the steak and I ordered the yellowtail snapper. Both were fantastic! For dessert we ordered the triple layer chocolate cake which was a perfect end to a great dinner. 5/5 We will definitely be coming back again!
I really liked eating here. They have the best crabs in town and they are the best type of quality. They make sure to boil the crabs and serve them at the exact right temperature. The way that they prepare the food is also different from many other restaurants. They make sure to only use the finest ingredients and make it taste good. I really loved this place because they also had great customer service. The people that served us were very friendly and they made sure to talk to us. They talked to me and my kid which made me very happy. Overall it is a great family restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone!
I ate at Frontera Grill & Topolobampo for the first time the other night. It was by far some of the best Mexican food I have eaten in a while. To start, the chips and salsa was excellent. The salsa was spicy, but not to spicy and the chips were warm. Then they brought out my tacos. The meat and beans were cooked to perfection. The veggies were juicy and flavorful. I was so full from my main coarse that I couldn't even fathom having dessert, but it looked delicious and I'll be sure to save room for next time. This was a great dining experience. The servers were very friendly and the food was brought out in a timely manner. The atmosphere was very authentic and appealing. This was a very family friendly restaurant. I highly recommend Frontera Grill & Topolobampo. 5/5 Stars!
The Frontera Grill & Topolobampo restaurant is a very refreshing place. The customer service was outstanding, they treated my husband and I with respect,and always checked on us. The food was superb , and we loved the fact that the food was very fresh.
Rating: 4.5/5 I have been to Xoco a couple of times and loved it, but this was my first trip to the 'Original' of the Bayless empire. Me, my wife, and another couple. Waited for 30 minutes on a Wednesday night, but that's what we'd been told to expect so no bigs. Drinks while we waited, always a plus! We are all guacamole junkies so got the grilled chive version. Super fragrant and piquant, it was just what we were looking for. Ran out of chips too fast but the waiter was on it. Our friends split the tortilla soup which smelled and looked great. Another round of drinks; I got the 'Gold Rush' which was good and stiff but sweeter than I like. The wife got one of the margaritas which she considered pretty much perfect. I switched to cerveza after that so I would be able to remember the main course. I got the duck in jamaican mole (Mexican restaurant, I know, I panicked when he came to take our order). Duck was super flavorful and you could tell they put some work into the mole. The sides were good but hard to remember next to the main dish. I devoured it and almost got mad when my wife asked for a bite. She got the pibil special, a roast pig in banana leaves. It looked a little crazy but tasted awesome. Our friends got an enchilada and carne asada, looked great but I didn't try it; the portions are generous and filling, and I had my own work cut out for me. Only complaints: got pretty loud, but it was also pretty busy so go figure. Tables were a little small, especially with all the different plates and sauces. And after we turned down dessert (too full!) the waiter never offered another drink, but really that was fine as we'd all had a few. He was probably looking out for us. So a couple of minor missteps on ambience (really minor) and one tiny complaint about my drink, thus the subtraction of a .5 star. Hey they can't all be perfect. Everything else was excellent IMO. Definitely not a stop in on a whim kind of place, but I'm already planning what to get when we get a chance to go back!
I recently moved from Austin to Chicago about 6 months ago and I was starting to really miss some good ol' tex mex food. A friend and I found Frontera online with some good reviews so we decided to give it a shot. That was probably the best decision I made all week. The wait staff was very friendly and everything we ordered came out quickly. I got the carbon tacos and they were delicious. Exactly what I needed to bring be back home for an evening.
I went to Fonter with my wife for lunch. The atmosphere and service were both amazing. We weren't quite sure what to expect beforehand, but, we were very happy once we went there. It's a nice cozy place, where you can sit back and enjoy a meal without being distracted by too many people. We started out with the fresh corn tamales, and let me tell you, they were amazing. We then went on to have the Tacos Al Carbon with steak. It was cooked perfectly and was honestly, probably the best steak taco I've ever had. If you do go, make sure you check out the homemade ice cream. Ben and jerry's has nothing on these guys. It goes perfectly with the chocolate pecan pie as well! If you are in the neighborhood, definitely check them out, we'll be back for sure!
I was pleasantly surprised to find such a fantastic restaurant in Chicago (okay, wasn't suprised, but was suprised on the quality due to the low cost!) ! My friend and I were working here for three weeks and stopped by on a rare night that we got off early. I had the lobster bisque, which was really incredible, and the arugula salad, which was good but not too heavy on the arugula (diluted with spinach, which was acceptable to me) and also a little too sweet. Overall it was tasty and filling however, for only $12. The wine was good and the service was excellent. I wish the beer list was more extensive. My friend got the Seafood Newburg and really loved it- I think I would probably get an entree instead of a salad next time despite the steep price increase. A little expensive but expected in the city.
First time when I stepped into this restaurant, I felt upbeat! The atmosphere of this restaurant was very lively. I loved the music, the decoration, and most of all the waiter who served my table. He was very attentive and friendly although the restaurant was pretty busy at that time. Since I was still full from my late lunch, I decided to order just an entree called Carne Asada el Mole Negro (hope I spelled it right). It was quite pricey but absolutely delicious. My friend got herself Torta Ahogada. She let me have some, and again, it was very tasty and healthy too. While we were eating, the owner even came to our table and asked how do we like the food. Overall, this restaurant deserves 5 stars and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends because I am sure they will not be disappointed. I am now mouthwatering and thinking about going back to this place again tomorrow!
My boyfriend and I were on vacation in Chicago and, as always, were looking for a great restaurant to try out. After reading several reviews we decided to try out Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. This worked very well for us because my boyfriend loves seafood and he doesn't get it often enough because I'm much more interested in steak. It's difficult to find a place that does both equally well but Joe's does it! Everything about our experience was amazing, starting when we walked into the restaurant. I loved the dark wood of the ceilings and the beautiful mahogany tables. The lighting was perfect to create a romantic dining experience for the two of us. After being seated we were greeted by a charming, friendly waiter dressed impeccably in black tie. He was extremely helpful in offering suggestions and very observant and prompt in making sure we had everything we needed. I ordered the bone in filet and my boyfriend ordered stone crab. The food was excellent; very flavorful and cooked perfectly. We both agreed that we would definitely eat at Joe's again the next time we visit Chicago.
Honestly speaking this is the best and most delicious food I have ever had in the longest time. After moving into this new neighborhood I didn't really know any good places to eat. During a friendly conversation, my neighbor suggested me this place and I am so glad I spoke to him. Honestly, the food is amazing; they make it fresh, itao>>s clean and service is just wonderful. Unlike most restaurants the silver wear is actually spotless clean! I was highly impressed by the service, cleanliness and the quality of the food. One of the best foods I have ever had. I would highly-highly recommend this to everyone. You actually get what you pay for. It's affordable, it's healthy and it's amazing. You will love it, I know I did.
What a find!!! While vacationing with my husband in Chicago over Father's Day (June 16, 2013), we decided to venture into new territory! We visited the Frontera Grill Diner. This is definitely a "award winning" establishment. The food was spectacular! I experienced the Frontera Grill Dinner - a "Live Fire Entree"! Garlic-marinated Gulf mahimahi, hoja santa crema (poblano, masa). Queso ai+-ejo mashed potatoes, arugula salad, spicy hoja santa tostada. It was the absolute BEST! Kudos to the staff, as well! Although the restaurant was busy, we were seated very quickly, and the waiter took very good care of us - he made us feel like we were his only patrons!! The only downside to the Frontera Grill Diner? Too many delicious things to choose from. It will take a lot of trips to try everything! We WILL BE BACK, Frontera!!! Cheers!!!
Fontera Grill is one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. Simply stated, no other Mexican restaurant in the city can compare. They are always introducing new dishes to the menu, and I have never had a bad experience when eating there. Chef Bayless's talent seems to know no boundaries beyond the availability of fantastic seasonal ingredients in a place so distant from Mexico. It also seems that no matter what meal I eat there, I am always pleased with the dishes I receive. I especially love the Sunday Brunches, mostly because of the fantastic cocktails that are available. Like the food, these change with the seasons, but they are all wonderful and refreshing. The only problem I have with Fontera is that is can be hard to get into sometimes. They are no longer a Chicago secret (for good reason!) and you now have to have reservations weeks in advance for a Friday or Saturday night. Luckily, that is never a problem for me because I book a table every other week regardless! I would recommend Fontera to anyone who asked. Seriously, it's just that good.
This place is awesome! I went here with my whole family for fathers day and it was the perfect place for us to go! The margaritas were delicious and the food was amazing! We will definitely be going back!
An evening at the Frontera Grill is a mini trip to Mexico. From the vibrant colors on the walls. to the festive sounding music that takes over the minute you walk in the door. The food, all made from farm fresh ingredients is all just right. The creamy guacamole is an excellent appetizer. The steak fahitas easily feeds two people. Their signature margarita makes you want to dance all night The atmosphere was nice. The food was good. You will find me there on many Friday nights
My boyfriend and I stopped by Frontera Grill the other night for dinner and were really pleased - it was overall a delicious experience and very reasonably priced. I started off with the blood orange margarita - incredible! Definitely a unqiue item, and I loved the flavor. My boyfriend had a rum and ginger cocktail which he said was very good. They also had the typical Mexican beers and a small selection of craft beers, which I will definitely be sampling next time. Since we are both fish lovers, we started out with the tropical tuna cocktail, which was sashimi grade tuna with an amazing tomatillo-based sauce and tangy salsa. And for the meal, we both got taquitos, which also came with a tomatillo-based sauce and guacamole. They were excellent (though I have loved every taquito I have ever eaten!) and came in a satisfyingly large portion. Best of all, the price was reasonable. The taquito entree is less than $10, so even though we had a great meal it did not hurt our wallets much. We had a great time here and really enjoyed our food, so I definitely will be back, and recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes high-quality Mexican food!
From the moment you walk into the Frontera Grill & Topolobampo you feel as if you are dining in quality. American food with a Mexican twist the food and service we had was top notch. Our service was fast accurate and courteous and the prices were very reasonable for such a nice selection. I coming back.
We were absolutely blown away with our experience here last night. Upon arrival, we immediately knew that this was no ordinary Mexican place. The decor and staff was a step above anywhere else we have ever been. Our waiter was very kind and courteous. He helped us navigate the menu and gave us some great suggestions. We were a bit taken aback by the prices at first, but as soon as we tried our food, we knew exactly why. It was incredible! There wasn't a single item that we did not absolutely love. It's nice to have some authentic Mexican in the area now. We will definitely be back!
Frontera Grill is one of my favorite places to go to for a night out or even lunch. If you are there for lunch make certain you try the "Mexico City-Style Quesadillas," an affordable and delicious meal that will keep your tastebuds begging for more. The wide variety of foods and drinks makes Frontera an amazing place to bring friends, family, colleagues, or children. Four stars all the way.
I have heard good things about Rick Bayless, as my best friend loves the Bravo show "Top Chef Masters". When I learned that he was opening a restaurant near my home in Chicago, I was intrigued, and my friend, who lives in Minneapolis, begged me to go on her behalf. I went during my lunch break, since I hate crowds. The atmosphere was great-- it was definetely based on real cafi(c)s in Mexico, and had just the right amount of trendiness to make it fun, but not hipsteresque. The bartenders looked like masters of their craft, as I saw other guests order difficult-to-make cocktails and drinks. And the mixers had no problem doing so. The waitress I had, Kathleen, was wonderful, and she gave me enough time to make my choice. As I looked at the menu, the first thing that caught my eye was Frontera's commitment to organic food. I've always preferred that to the standard supermarket fare, as it is healthier, fresher and (above all) tastier. I usually cook at home because there are so few organic restaurants here in Chicago, but I was very excited to discover that this one was! Now, I won't have to clean as many plates or pans, since I can eat here! After gazing the menu's wide selection, I settled on oysters with a side of black kale. I love both, and never have the former, since quality oysters are so hard to find at supermarkets. After Kathleen delivered them, I was intringued by this Latin take on a New England tradition, being from Boston. And I was amazed! The limes enhanced the oysters much better than any lemon could, and eating them with the garlic-chipotle salsa made a delightful entree heavenly. All the flavors combined to accent the smooth taste of the oysters, and they did so in perfect harmony. The kale was also delightful. I love this vegetable, as it is so flavorful, unlike many vegetables, and so healthy. I love it cooked in olive oil, but Frontera's addition of grilled onions made it unbelievable. The strong taste of the kale, with the fresh flavor of the onions was a spectacular marriage-- and it certainly is one made by Rick, one of the best matachmakers in the culinary world. In all, I was very impressed by Frontera and by Rick's cooking skills. My friend was right: Rick has great recipes and skill, and his dishes are healthy, and friendly to the Earth. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves good food-- and social responsibility, too.
