The reviews of this camera are correct. It is an excellent SLR. High megapixel produces great images and usual canon controls. For landscape photography it really does the job. Video is clear, would like to see better out focus and can be grainy at high ISO. Recommend staying at lower ISO, but I have been able to take amazing night sky shot. Really love 6D and cost just right
Great sensor with high ISO. Purchased two years ago. Full-frame camera at a terrific price point. The high ISO and HD video capabilities make this a terrific purchase at a $1,600 price point. Sensor/ISO quality is much better than 5D Mark II--compared via indoor videography.
This camera is simply amazing. It's small and light weight. It's also very easy to learn the new features (compared to my last Canon body). There's nothing wrong about it. It takes stunning pics. The best part is the built-in wifi feature. The camera gets on its wifi and from my iPhone, I can see the pics and instantly post my shot. Love this camera. Can't recommend it enough!!!!
Amazing camera body, combined with EF 24-105/F4.0 L zoom. An excellent combo. Has very high resolution, excellent color quality and extremely versatile. Still experimenting and learning its huge range of features. Excellent FX sensor camera at a reasonably low price.
Favorite camera in my bag with it's light but strong body, full frame sensor, and high resolution. For the price, can't be beat. I do love the 5d Mk III but, again, for the money, can't be beat and sometimes the features on the 5d almost seem overkill for every day and wedding shooting.
Been shooting it for four months. I love the low light capabilities. I opted for this over the 5D M3. I am satisfied. No stars off because of the position of the AF button. My hands are big and with my hand strap I am always accidentally pushing it.
WOW, a year later and I'm still finding new stuff... only complaint is the wireless feature, doesn't seem to have a very good range when using my phone and remote apps. Otherwise this camera is awesome! Very happy!
Very high end, full-frame professional camera. The 2014 canon rebate made the price right. Lots of research went into this purchase and this is where I landed for a full-frame camera!
I need to have always in my house these marker. I use them to write my lists,and they look awesome!Just get a frame,change the default pic with a nice pattern background and you have a cool board.
I ordered these because I got a great deal and half regretted it until I tried them out. Did I need them? No.. but they're beautiful! They glide over surfaces. I tried them out on windows and the color is bright and happy. They wipe off with a little pressure. I'm confident I'll get a lot of use out of these!
These are great. They work on any non porous surface, but I've only used them on glass so far. They're perfect for writing on the bathroom mirror and windows. The colors are vibrant, a lot brighter than I had expected. And they come with this cute holder. The ink washes off easily too. I love these markers!I recieved these at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review.
Theses are really amazing. I hadn't really thought of using these before but after getting them you realize how many things you can use them on. We mostly use them on car and house windows (our own of course) to have fun like drawing a face on our back car window or flowers on our house windows. These do come off easily when you need them too and they don't have any smell.
These markets work great on chalk board or black foam boards. Love the silicone case that comes with them!!
It takes a couple of minutes to get the marker ready to write for the first time. The color look great and tip of marker stays saturated with ink. The paint is dry after few seconds. A lot better than the average dry marker. I would not recommend for small children however.
My daughter LOVED these ans uses them every day! They are so bright on her chalk board. I would lutchase these agian and agian. I recieved this product at a discount for my review.
I was given a discount in exchange for an honest review. These chalk markers work great! Gorgeous colors, perfect for decorating my husband's car for our anniversary. (*evil laugh*) Highly recommended! The holder is super handy, too.
These are great markers! There is no smell like those permant markers! The colors are so bright and cool! I can think of a lot of applications from the glass to labeling things in my pantry! Will get s lot of uses out of them, thank you for a great product!
Wonderful marker set for advertising using our storefront glass. Its a business must have. It does take about one minute or so of priming the market before its ready for use.
Just got these markers! Love them! Very cool! These are perfect for use in my classroom. Very easy to use, with bright colors.
Very bright, smooth flow. As an amateur crafter I am delighted with these chalk markers ---- small to large chalk board displays are one of my hobbies and these ones with their super bright colors add the special touch needed to impress.
We homeschool and these are the first chalkboard markers I have ever used. I love how smooth they write. This is a seriously great buy. I don't know how I got along without them.
I received these today and could not wait to try them. They do not leak nor do they run and they come out clean and even. I have chalk bubbles up the wall by my front door to remind me of appointments and such, and with these bright colors I feel more secure knowing that I will notice my important dates as they stand boldly out.
Good book..I enjoyed the story and the subplots. Good character development and story lines. I highly recommend the whole series.
I found this book delightful. It is quite entertaining and has an original look at dominant and submissive relationships. What happens when a charming, handsome dominant falls hard for a girl who is not a natural submissive but is a total sexual innocent. Can they make it work? Can they learn to love and trust each other. Will they need to make compromises and can they?
All everyone talks about is all the kinky sex that goes on, but really.. There's so much more to this book. I read Fifty Shades Of Grey in less than two weeks. Completely and absolutely hooked from the very first chapter. It's like a television series that ends each episode with something crazy and you just have to see what's gonna happen next! Ahh love it love it !
I actually seen the movie first and decided I wanted to read the book to compare note. The book was well written I thought, and would recommend it to all the curious ladies out there.
 actually love this series..... I get into it... sexually hahaha but you need a read. And you want something different. Go ahead and try. Instead of judging.
Best enduring, soul searching, gut reaching, heartless finds true love- story ever written. I will read these books until I'm 100.. Timeless classics
It came nicely packaged. I used it after I washed my daughters hair with a dab of conditioner. Really soft and shiny. I used on my hair as well, then flat ironed it the next day. We have really curly hair and it gets real dry. My hair came out shiny too without being greasy. I use on my dry hands and cuticles too. It's non greasy and doesn't have any smell to. Can't wait to cook with it.
Awesome product. I use it on my dry hands and my daughter's hair. It says external use only. But the label also says it can be used for cooking. consuming this would then become internal, which is confusing to me. for this reason I plan to only use it as described above (External use) as a safety precaution.
I use coconut oil all the time, but had never tried fractionated coconut oil before. This was to my surprise better and easier to use than the solid.
"If you have curly hair, I recommend you buying this product! I saw an almost instant improvement with my hair which is curly, colored, and damaged from straightening. It was sent to me & received in exchange for my honest review."
I love this for mixed with my essential oils. Also i like so much, the follow up the company provide and service. I receive a discount on this product as exchange of my honest review. And im truly love all this products!
I absolutely LOVE this coconut oil! So far I've used it to help my daughter's cradle cap, clear up her diaper rash, and as a moisturizer on my legs. You don't have to use much so you really get your money's worth with the 16oz. I'll definitely make sure to keep this stocked in my house because of its versatility!
Excellent product. Very easy to use. So far I have used it for a skin moisturizer and after a shower in my hair for a light conditioner. I have a mild case of psoriasis and this is very soothing, non irritating. Non oily/greasy. I would purchase again.
This is a good sized bottle for the price. The smell is good. I was very surprised at all the different things you can use this for. I do believe this is the healthiest my hair has been in a long time. You only have to use very little and that works very effectively. I highly recommend. I WILL be buying it again. Love it.
Radha does it once again with excellent quality with their Coconut Oil! This oil is great for many skin conditions and can be used as carrier oil as well for massage oils. I use it as a moisturizer and it works very well, with a quick drying time and no staining. At this price and amount that comes in the decently-sized bottle, you are getting a good value too :)
Totally love it, is odorless like it says it doesn't dry out and works wonders, use it to give a well deserved massage to my husband and he loved it... I highly recommend this product
All the great voices we have gotten use to for years. love it and now happy to say I have the whole Justice League Series. Hurray!
had to been one of the best cartoon show around - great use of all the DC star - yes batman does steal the show - but love the use of all the other hero
Even without knowing anything about DC Comics, you can jump right into action with all the adventures included in all the episodes. My kids and I love it!!!!!!!!!!I bought it out of the correct order, but I like it!!!!!The correct order to watch is:1. Justice League - Season One2. Justice League - Season Two3. Justice League Unlimited - Season One4. Justice League Unlimited - Season Two
Love this set. Discs are well secured and fit in the box tightly to keep them safe and scratch free. Incredible special features/commentary tracks. Highly recommend for any collector.
I love this episode! Downloaded for the kiddos because its their fave too and they watched it 6 times in the car on the way home. Well worth the $!!
I love this show because it shows how even superheroes make mistake and own up to them. Even they aren't perfect. I also like how this show has actual plots and characters you care about. Marvel seems to be in it for the money, but DC Comics seems to care about the relation between the viewer and the characters on the show; making sure you can connect to some of the characters in a personal way.
I LOVE this series! Best animated series ever IMO. But ... Where are the Blu-Ray discs for both JLU's two seasons? The two JL seasons are out in Blu-Ray already. I want to buy these NOW but I really want the Blu-Ray treatment for them. Guess I'll have to wait a while. Drats!!
IS A GREAT REPRODUCTION, THE EXACT NUMBER OF EPISODES AND ALL COMPLETE. SO FAR NO COMPLAIN. I LOVE JUSTICE LEAGUE! XD
this is the show that really solidified the durability of the DCAU in the wake of BtAS and SuperBat Adventures, before Batman Beyond. while the predilection for two-part episodes got annoying later on, this is still eminently satisfying to rewatch.
Justice League: So much imagination. I so enjoy cartoons. I so enjoy Justice League. Voice actors, thought that goes into the clever writing, just the total imagination and everything that goes into making these awesome shows. Thank you.
I love the theme song so having it appear all the time did not bother me. I loved seeing other characters from the DC world. Each episode usually focused on one villain or hero. I loved it. I wish Shayera would wear her mask though :)
ordered these for my 47 year old boyfriend and he loves them, he almost watched them all already and will be ordering more
What can you say about these Justice League Animated shows. Hard to find on television, so pick them up now while you can. Great show. Don't go over $20, but try to get for $15 even if its used.
I used to catch bits and pieces of this on TV back when I was in high school and only recently remembered about it. Pretty pleased with Amazon for making this one available, it's successfully resparked the inner comic book nerd in me.
Great collection of the justice league unlimited episodes. Great stories, great animation, very happy with this collection. Will buy the next one soon.
This is exactly the television we were looking for. No complaints at all. Highly recommended if all you need is a simple, thin, light, and non-smart TV that has excellent picture and sound. We mounted this on our wall right away with ease and have been enjoying it ever since.
I'd seriously give this product 6 stars if I could. I'm thoughoughly impressed with this TV. I have two Samsung 6000, 7000 series and this matches their quality, possibly even better. The picture is crystal clear and sound is great. My best buy on Amazon to date!
HD pic definitely great. For the price you really can't go wrong. The legs have to be installed (which I found great as I was putting on wall anyway) and it is pretty light. Overall great value thus far
Rarely write reviews, however this tv is worth writing about. Clear sound, perfect picture. Audio could be better but it's really good. Besides you can adjust the audio to how you want it which I did and now it's perfect. No complaints here. This tv is amazing and I'm glad I got it.
Great vacuum. I have a dog, and this thing sucks up all of the dog hair with ease. It has a long enough cord that I can vacuum the majority of my apartment without unplugging & replugging in every room. I like how the brush-roll is auto-adjust -- no need to stoop down and convert the brush roller from "low carpet" to "high carpet." Emptying the canister is also a breeze.
It's lightweight and has a lot of power. I didn't realize how much dust accumulated in my carpets. The canister is large and holds a lot of dirt and the attachments make it easy to clean any area. I love it!
loving this vacuum. needed something strong to pick up dog hair but I hated my Dyson--too heavy with not enough control. Everyone I surveyed said "Shark" and I chose this one that Amazon had a great price for. Very happy so far. Strong suction, with a release to handle small area rugs, lightweight feel with great easy turning.
This vacuum is awesome! It picks up everything, it's fast, and the cord has a decent length to it. It wasn't even difficult to put together. I'm so happy I spent the money for this vacuum, as it was TOTALLY worth the price!
Oh my goodness; what an excellent mqchine! I was a little sceptical until I read a review by another person who's situation is similar to ours; lots of pet hair! My rugs look brand new; no exaggeration. I have psoriatic arthritis and this is easy to push, maneuver around & lightweight.
Absolutely LOVE this machine! I purchased it based on the reviews I read....and everyone said exactly what this machine did! I was shocked at how much it picked up and sadly embarrassed because of the other machines I've purchased which did absolutely nothing :( I pray this baby will last forever.....MUST HAVE!
This vacuum has tremendous suction - as a matter of fact, the attachments and hose have a "bleeder" port so as not to pull the paint off the walls. Works well, picks up pet hair well, is lightweight and easy to maneuver. Watch out Dyson....As to longevity, I will amend review if needed.
I purchased the Shark Navigator Deluxe to replace our old vacuum. It is a lot smaller than our old one, but works GREAT! We've only been using it for a couple of weeks so far. The suction is impressive, and it practically pulls itself along! As of now, I'm very happy with it. We will see after using it for a longer period of time.
Had the Shark Navigator and loved it. Lasted longer than any vacumn I'd ever owned. Got the Navigator Deluxe and am one happy camper again. It's just as great with the added bonus of being self-propelled and a larger dust cup. Way to go go Shark!
It had no suction at first so I assumed it was broke, but the next day it was working just fine! I owned a shark navigator, but my dig ate the chord, so I used my hose on this deluxe vacuum because it did not come with a hose and some minor things, such as the handle screws. My point is, I am going to use my navigator to supply the parts for my deluxe. Other than that, it works like brand new!
A lot better then Bose headphones and cost $300 less . They are very comfortable(sometimes I forget I am wearing them) and the sound is so crisp and clean. The first time I bought them was back in 2005. after 5 years of wearing them they broke and but I am buying a another pair.
Called the company, excellent customer service. I put it in a 1978 3/4 ton full size Chevy truck and did not have to modify anything. This thing works like a champ.

Awesome brake controller with many options. Installed on a 2003 f250. Easy to install works great. Tow an open 16 landscape trailer. 14' enclosed and a 20' enclosed loaded with lawnmowers. Handles all no problem. Easy to switch trailer modes with the boost button once set. It's great!! Looks great in truck too.
This controller is great. I installed it and the setup was easy. I had a short one day at the trailer and the controller automatically sent a trouble warning. I was impressed. I would buy this controller again. Great product.
I got this controller in 2011 and it has been fantastic. The acuity of the control is second to none. I recently had an issue and it was resolved under warranty with no problem or stress. I've hauled 18 and 40 foot trailers and the ability to adjust the voltage is a must have feature.
Great brake control! Let's you know if things are connected as they should be. Much more advanced than my prior control. They all should be made like this. Has been very durable over the years
Easy to operate and easy to see when making adjustments to the braking force. You will not go wrong with this EBC!
Worked well. I wish all cars with a toeing package had a built in controller, until then, this was easy to install and use.
Perfect replacement for an old Tekonsha unit. Very easy install in our 2004 Expedition using the Tekonsha 3035-P Brake Control Wiring Adapter also purchased on amazon. Mounting bracket and holes were identical to the old unit. Easy set-up for our new Double D horse trailer. The all-electronic (vs mechanical pendulum in the old Tekonsha) of this controller gives us smooth stops.
Unit works great. Only have 2 complaints1. The installation instructions are not detailed.2. There isnt any way to turn it off. However it does go to sleep but really wish I could turn it off.that being said there may of been a whole book of instructions that wasn't in there.
After installing it in our truck, the trailer shop we worked with is starting to carry them because they liked how it operated, installed and looked. I couldn't be happier and feel so much more secure with our 28' snowmobile trailer when its loaded and the roads are questionable.
This brake controller is absolutely transparent in operation. I press the brake, my truck and trailer stops quickly with zero drama. 74 Scout II, 1969 14" Timberline LoLander. Brand new Dexter 3500# axle.
Tekonsha makes a REALLY good brake controller. Have used this now between two different trailers and it adjusted so easily between the two different sizes and weights. Love the inertia sensing and auto adjustments. There are cheaper units available of course, but after using this I wouldn't ever consider going to them.
This is a night and day difference between my old controller. It is so smooth with my 35 FT trailer. The best purchase I have made for towing my monster of a trailer.
First time needing a brake controller, went with this one because of the reviews. Very happy with decision, easy to hook up. Very easy to set up once trailer is hooked up.
Comfortable, easy to read and the night light is an added benefit! Only problem I have is the stem is a little difficult to pull out to set time or date other than that it's the perfect watch for me!
I have always owned a Timex watch...actually my Timex sopped keeping time after several years of constant everyday wear..so I was so happy that Amazon offered 2 day free delivery as I am a person that cannot live without my watch..for the price you cannot beat a Timex watch. Love it and thank you Amazon for such prompt delivery.
Purchased this for my 93 year old mother this Christmas. She totally loved it! Especially since she can light up the dial to see it even better. Would recommend it as I had already purchased one for myself and liked it for the same reasons.
always buy Timex as they're durable, have an easy-read face, second hand, and the light-up dial. Strap is ample. Equal quality to past watches. I've gotten compliments on this style.
The watch is basic but it is perfect if you only need it to be accurate in telling time and the current date. I've had several of these in the past and they've all worked well.
It is a bit plain looking but has the night glow I needed and easy to read numbers. The band is not quite the nice thicker rawhide of earlier times but works just fine. It also fits my rather large wrist. And I have always trusted Timex.
Was heartbroken when I lost a similar style Timex as it was my favorite and kept excellent time. Am equally happy with this purchase which is identical to the old one except it has the addition date feature. As always, Amazon provided a great price and fast shipping.
Nice watch with good styling and comfort and not too bulky or large on the wrist but a clear and easily readable face. And the indigo nightlight is a nice feature...particularly when the season makes the days shorter and more consistently dark than not.
Very practical. Such a great watch! Really worth the price because it's water proof, it has an elegant design yet simple, and it features "indiglo" which comes in handy at night. I received it the next day which was super fast!
This is a nice basic everyday watch. The numbers are easy to read and I love having the Indiglo light for at night when I wake up and wonder what time it is.Timex is a trusted brand and it was delivered quickly.
I love this watch! I have small wrists and I didn't have to make any additional holes to fit. I love that it lights up at night when I want to see the time. Awesome watch!
Best watch ever. My wife and me have been using this watch for many years. Easy to read, and the best "night watch" with the Indiglo feature.
This is at least the 3rd purchase I have made-I love this watch-only problem ever is the leather wears out after a while, but I buy straps for it and am good for awhile!
I have been buying and replacing with this same style watch for years. Very convenient. with the help of the glo light I can read the watch at any time or condition of day. I really depend on it. Now I have one in spare.
It's a great watch! So far, the date function has been working fine and the light feature is also nice when checking the time late at night (a lot better than blinding myself with my cell phone).The band and watch face are small and it looks pretty / feminine, but can fit a variety of wrist sizes.
It's a Timex, pretty much indestructible! The dial is definitely easy to read as advertised and my aging mom really appreciates the Indiglo dial light feature.
This is my second indiglo watch. I lost the first one in my house and bought another one just like it. That's how much I think of this watch.
My dad purchased this for my 84 year old mother. She had been looking for something simple with an easy read dial. My father suggested searching for good old Timex and we found this. Great price and my mom loves it. She has very small wrists and this adjusted down to her size which many watches don't.
I bought this toaster a few months ago and it worked great right from the start. At first I was concerned because I thought the elements were not all working. Boy was I wrong! I used the factory setting of 4 and it put the perfect golden brown toast evenly on the bread. I have used it many times and the toast comes out perfectly every time. I highly recommend this toaster!
We received the toaster right on time -- Prime shipping is fantastic!! The toaster is great. We have had several toasters and have been disappointed because of uneven toasting. This Cuisinart toasts evenly. This is the best one we have had since our old Sunbeam automatic gave up.
We are very pleased with it. We have been through 4 toasters in the last 3 years, and this Cuisinart works far better than of the other ones. It toasts all four slices evenly, and we love the 2-ding bell when the toast is done. The default timer is 4, but we like our toast a bit darker, so we use the 5 setting.
This is my second indiglo watch. I lost the first one in my house and bought another one just like it. That's how much I think of this watch.
Hosted a private birthday celebration for 17 & everything from planning long distance by phone to the dinner event went great! All staff were friendly, helpful & knowledgable. The food was really good including passed appetizers during cocktail time, salad, large choice of entrees which guests chose and several delicious desserts to chose from! Private Michael's room & our own dinner captain made the event fun & worry free for me so I could enjoy the celebration with family & friends who had flown in from all directions to celebrate our Mom's 80th birthday! Everyone enjoyed & raved about party! Thanks Joe's--will do again!
My wife and I made reservations a month in advance as we had heard that tables were tough to come by here. Having eaten the food, I can see why. We each had a large stone crab appetizer and I'm here to tell you stone crab claws are the most sweet and succulent sea creature I've ever eaten. Joe's serves them with a mustard dipping sauce that is to die for. The stone crabs alone are enough to get me to come back. I ordered king crab legs for my entree. I so rarely get crab legs, so few places do them well where I live so for me they're a treat. Joe's did not disappoint, they were big, meaty and delicious. My wife ordered scallops which were perfectly prepared and seasoned. On the negative side, the service wasn't all that good. Our waiter treated us as though we were idiots who just fell off the turnip truck. We had ordered desert and when it arrived the waiter brought our check. Halfway through our desert the waiter stopped back to see if we had put cash or a credit card out for him. Upon discovering that we had not yet, the waiter than stood 15 feet away and watched us until I put my credit card out. It was as though he thought we were going to take off without paying. I'm a lawyer in my 30's but apparently this waiter thinks I look like the type to leave without paying. Ridiculous. I won't let a bad waiter spoil my meal though. Joe's is worth going to for the stone crabs alone. Just ignore the waiters who believe all their customers are crooks.
While the wait may be long, don't despair it's worth it. While you wait, you can hang out and admire the gorgeous Mexican artwork or take a walk around the block, they will give you a call on your cell phone when your table is ready. The food is scrumptious. Have the fresh ceviche to start with freshly made chips and your appetite will only continue to grow. I had duck carnita quesadillas, nicely braised meat with some homemade tortillas, a fresh salad, and mashed black beans cooked to perfection. End the meal with a phenomenal, traditional Mexican hot chocolate and you will leave with a smile on your face for a very long time.
My boyfriend saw Weber Grill on TV and, being about as carnivorous as they come, wanted to go to Chicago JUST to eat there. Neither one of us was disappointed. We came in on a Sunday night, nearly time for closing, and a bit tipsy. We were the only non-employees in this behemoth of a restaurant and we were warmly greeted and promptly seated. Our waitress Austra was very nice and the head chef came out to talk to us, probably after having observed my boyfriend checking out the giant grills in the kitchen. The employees were engaging without being irritating (not the kind of waitstaff that comes and sits down at your table to take your order). The place was clean and our meal: a steak with potatoes, appetizers, one drink for each of us, and a burger and fries, came to less than $80. Very pleasant experience. Good location. I would definitely go again. I rated it 4 stars (Very Good) because the steak didn't really blow me away. But it WAS good and my overall experience was AWESOME. Great atmosphere and friendly, attentive waitstaff. Not a rude person in the bunch.
From my experience, the Weber Grill was a great spot for a good piece of barbecued meat. We went on a weeknight, at about 10 o'clock (the place stays open pretty late), and were seated opposite the open kitchen. The centerpiece of the kitchen is the string of oversized Weber grills -- the restaurant only cooks with charcoal and wood, not gas -- that fill the place with a wonderfully smoky smell. Food was terrific. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and crab cakes as appetizers, both of which were delicious. As entrees, we chose the ribs, roast chicken, meatloaf, and brisket. We enjoyed the chicken and ribs most -- not to take away anything from the meatloaf and brisket, which were both righteous as well. Service was exceptional. For example, there was a bit of confusion as to whether we had ordered both the crab cakes and the spinach/artichoke dip as appetizers (we thought we had ordered just the crab cakes). When both dishes were served, and we reminded our waiter (who thought we had ordered both) that we only ordered the crab cakes, he let us keep both appetizers on the house. It was a truly courteous and considerate move. Value was solid. Most entrees are in the $15-25 range, with burgers closer to $10 and steaks closer to $30. We felt we got our money's worth. In the future, we will turn to the Weber Grill when we crave some seriously smoky barbecue in downtown Chicago.
The food was so good. We ordered the buffalo shrimp with blue cheese coleslaw and it was the favorite at the table. I also had the ribs which were great too. The story here is the service. It was fathers day and our waiter, a working father, was so welcoming from the time we sat down. He made the dining experience a pleasure. At the end of our meal we had a couple left over rolls and had asked if he could wrap up the rolls for us to go. Our waiter said he would bring out fresh rolls for us. We told him it wasn't necessary, we were just not looking to waste the left over rolls and hoping to give to one of the homeless men we passed on our walk to lunch. Before we know it, our waiter comes out with a take home container and a to go soda to give to the homeless man. We looked in and instead of our rolls, he had a full cheeseburger and fries. Random act of kindness - it was a nice ending to a wonderful lunch.
Was able to get in an hour earlier than reservation. Even in on a Saturday night. Had a drink at the bar while waiting for our table and the service was great (even when I spilled the beer across the bartop.) You can see your food being prepared on the weber grills which is cool. Has a family section and a couples section:) The food was excellent. Prime Rib was very tasty. The prices were unbelievable. Under $55 for 2 Prime Rib dinners.
Went here not expecting too much from a BBQ place but WOW, it was awesome! Everything was tasty and delicious! Try the skirt steak or the salmon... I know, you wouldn't think of salmon at a BBQ plac, but it was the best salmon I've ever had! The dessert list looked less than enticing so we passed, but all the entress - oh, and the artichoke appetizer - were phenomenal!
This restaurant was fantastic, the food was so good and the atmosphere and decor were incredible. We made reservations through opentable.com and were seated quickly (it was a weeknight). I ordered the Tuscan brick chicken which was so moist and incredibly delicious; my husband couldn't stop raving about his sausage and brisket, they were so moist and the best he'd had. I tried the sangria of the day, limoncello, and it was a bit too tart with the overwhelming pineapple-but still good. I would absolutely go back here again and would recommend it to my friends.
Food - I was expecting just the standard fare which was there but they also had some exciting variations to remind you you're in a big city. I had the crab cake appitizer which is served on top of a corn and black bean salsa, with chipotle mayo. I followed that with a "Martini" burger which is topped with blue cheese vodka sauce and green olive. It came under cooked for medium. Dessert was an apple crisp grilled in a brown paper bag. Presentation wasnt appetizing but it was Delicious! Value-about $55 before tip for a glass of wine, a draft beer, 2 appitizers, 1 shared burger and 1 shared dessert. Service-Nothing bad, nothing spectacular. Atmosphere-The kitchen is open to the restaurant. The flames jumping up from oversized weber grills makes for and exciting walk to the table.
We choose the Weber Grill due to it having a great outdoor eating area. We arrived at 8 PM on a Sunday night and were seated within 5 minutes. I believe this was in error however as there were couples/families that appeared to be waiting longer than us. But, I won't complain about that! Had a great table outside. I had the veggie burger and my husband had the beer can chicken. Both meals were excellent. The garlic mashed potato's were the best we've ever had. Meal with 4 alcoholic drinks came to about $50+tip which is very reasonable for Chicago. I've eaten at restaurants in Chicago and have paid over $100 for my meal and regretted it. If you want great food and don't want to overspend, goto the Weber Grill.
Today I took my step-dad for a nice steak at the Weber Grill Restaurant. This eatery was very busy, but as I had made a reservation I did not worry. We both ordered the New York Strip done medium and it was cooked to perfection. It was nicely charred on the outside, but still pink and juicy in the middle. Our steaks were served with homemade roasted garlic mashed potatoes and they were just as good as the meat. Also every table gets a basket of rolls with butter and a carafe of water. We eat, so much we almost did not want any desert, but decided to take it to go. My step-dad ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake and I ordered the chocolate bunt cake. Both oversized and very tasty. Although this restaurant was a little pricey it is nice for a spurge.
We had a great meal here! The stone crab and Alaskan King crab appetizers were awesome! Then the steaks came and they were just as awesome! Cooked perfectly. The sides were big enough to share as were the salads. The waiter was efficient and had a great knowledge of the menu. Overall it was a great meal and we will definitely return when back in Chicago.
Had a business dinner there. The steak and sides were great but I thought that the price was a bit more than the quality. Was supposed to be Prime Rib Eye but not sure thats what I got. The noise was another concern, could not hear yourself much less the people you were there with. We wanted to talk business and it was not possible.
I arrived late in Chicago last Wednesday night, and the woman at the hotel front desk recommended Weber Grill as a good place that serves later into the evening (It was after 10 pm). I walked up the street and was seated immediately. I didn't feel at all awkward as a woman alone, in spite of the bustling atmosphere. My server, Jamar, was warm, friendly and really knew the menu AND the cooks that night. He directed me away from things that weren't so good that evening and toward something that would leave me with a lasting impression. I started with a "Joe's Martini" ($9), prepared from a custom-made vodka. It was good and STRONG. For my entree, I had the bone-in rib-eye, rare. You can add things to your entree for either $3 or 2 for $5. I chose smoked mushrooms and the bleu cheese-herb mix. I also "upgraded" from either baked or mashed to the whipped sweet potatoes with maple butter. They were delicious. My steak was cooked to perfection. It seems difficult to find a cook these days who can properly distinguish meat temperature (thermometers, anyone?), but this cook was skilled. It was quite expensive ($38.50 by the time I "upgraded" everything), but how refreshing to pay that for a meal that pleased me in the extreme. I am a cook and can be a fussy pain in the neck, and I really liked my meal. They also have a nice wine vault with windows so you can eye the selections. I took "home" a half bottle of a favorite wine that I have trouble finding here in California, where it's produced (Mt. Veeder cab, 2002). I also took home an apple/caramel dessert, which took me three nights to finish, it was so big. It was also quite tasty. Perhaps it depends on the servers and cooks each night, but I had a great time and delicious meal at this place, and would go again.
My wife and I came upon this place while wandering through Chicago on foot. What a great find!! We absolutely loved the barbequed brisket and chicken. I clumsily spilled my wine just after it was served and the staff immediately cleaned it up and brought me a new one at no charge. Nice people and great barbeque at very reasonable prices.
I visited Weber Grill back in July, but it was so good I had to write a review. This was a recommendation from friends as a 'Must-eat-here' for my first visit to Chicago. I have good friends! I couldn't decide which main course I wanted (everything looked so good!) so our waited suggested we order a Weber Starter Sample to get a taste of most all the dishes we had been eyeing. Every single bite was delicious! It didn't make the decision for the main course any easier but I finally settled on the Filet Mignon, and I am not exaggerating when I say I was in heaven! I was cheated out of paying (Again, I have very good friends) but the price was very good value for the service and quality of the food we got. It is a must-eat for all you meat-lovers out there!
I know that this place has great food for lunch and dinner, but they also have a great breakfast buffet. They provide a buffet line with meats and eggs, as well as sausage gravy, etc. They will make to order omelets, waffles with different toppings, or french toast as part of the buffet, and there are a bevy of cold selections, as well as bagels, breads, and muffins, fruit, and yogurts, and so on. Reasonably priced, but probably not the cheapest one in town. Did not make a reservation, and had no trouble getting seated on a saturday morning at 9am...
Someone from Chicago recommended this restaurant to my husband and are we glad they did!! There were 7 of us and we all felt the same way. We did have reservations - glad we did otherwise it would have been a long wait. Generous portions on the main course (meat) but we felt the sides were a little skimpy - won't stop us from returning if we are in Chicago though. I had 3 large slices of the meatloaf - shared with the others to try and we all agreed it was the best meatloaf we had ever had! Our waitress started out a little "short" with us, but got friendlier as the meal progressed. Other than that, the service was very good and friendly.
We just came back from another great weekend in Chicago. We go to the Weber Grill every time. In a city with ridiculously priced steakhouses, this place is a gem. This time, we had ribs, and they were awesome. If you do go, try to stop in on a Sunday afternoon during football season. They run burger specials, $5, if memory serves me correctly. And I can say it is one of the best burgers you will ever eat in your life. After all, if Weber's can't make a good burger, no one can! Also, they have a Bloody Mary special too. Enjoy, you can thank me later LOL.
A relaxed atmosphere just blocks from Magnificent Mile. Great signage outside (huge red grills hanging off the building). Great decor inside (sort of arts & crafts, nice wood and natural stone). But on to the food: Got the BBQ Sampler... the grilled chicken literally fell off the bone it was so tender... grilled sausage... pork... AND ribs! Seriously, what more could you want. The berry dessert was delicious. Staff was attentive. Sure, it's kind of kitchy with the grills all abound... but great food!
this is a; busy, bustling, smiling, fabulous, slice of real America. Food was really really good (skirt steak a revelation!) and not just focused on steaks which pleased my good lady who had a lovely piece of fish. Starter taster plate (for 2) was excellent, and above all the service was 100%. So good we went back for lunch 2 days later.
Had a great experience while there a few weeks ago, ate here 3 times in 4 days (convenience mostly, but no complaints) while staying at the Hilton Garden next door. Great service, get here early on weekends, can be busy. Had a 3 item combo plate with BBQ Meatloaf.........INSANELY GOOD. have never had anything like it, loved every bit of it, was actually on the web trying to get the recipe before we finished dining. Great food, weber coal grills cooking like crazy, my kinda grill. I do have to compliment the person who chooses the bottled beers, You have choosen one that I have, and will always view as one of the BEST Sweet Stouts or beer period, I have ever tasted. I am in no way a beer connoisseur, maybe drink 12 beers a year, I had 4 of these alone, I may become one now, now that I have tried Left Handed Brewery's Milk Sout.....EXCELLENT. Great Restaurant and atmosphere.
On a Saturday late lunch, starving, we followed the advice that friends gave us. Choice between a formal dining room with tables fully dressed, or the bar section, with high tables. We settled for the high tables. Quick and efficient service, we ordered the Joe's seafood lunch, their "signature" lunch choice. It was great. Even the hash brown was delicious, crusty. The crab was excellent. And as a finishing touch, a waiter comes with sliced lemon over a small bowl so you can clean your hands after eating the crab :-) The ambience is very cosy. An all dark wooden bar, two discrete TVs, a good mix of people. We'll clearly go back for trying the rest :-)
We are charcoal grillers on Weber grils at home, and were truly excited to see this restaurant. We have tried burgers and mix Barbecue (ribs and briskets). The plate came with wrong choices. They gladly and rapidly came with the missing ribs and left us the wrong ordered chicken. It was very nice of them and gave us the chance to taste even more. Everything was truly excellent and the price was all right for what we've had. We were sitting at the bar and it was nice to see the cooks working on the huge, custom Weber grils.
On Saturday night, September 22, 40 (old) members and spouses of BB chapter, Delta Tau Delta, DePauw University, gathered in a private dining room to celebrate over 50 years of wonderful memories. Classes of 1951-64 were represented and while our tab was in excess of 12 grand, all agreed it was still the best value in town! Since "What happens at Gibsons stays at Gibsons" applies, I'll let you draw your own conclusions. But I will say don't ever hesitate to call them for your next function, be it for 20 or 200. When you walk in the front door you'll be in the hands of hospitality experts, even if half of your guests are on walkers, deaf, in diapers or boarder line Alzheimer's :)
Shoddy and inattentive bartender is the only spoiler for this highly rated venue. The best steaks in the US beating dny of its contemporaries. Restaurant service impeccable.
Four of us went to Gibson's. First we enjoyed sitting by the piano listening to Bob play and sing while we enjoyed some drinks. We even joined in on a few of the songs. Then we were escorted in to the dining area. Our waiter, Elvis, was very knowledgeable and humorous! We ordered our WR steaks, potatoes and a vegetable. The steaks were done to perfection! The char grilling on the outside of the steaks was amazing! The meat just melted in our mouths as did the mashed potatoes. By the time we finished, we were too full for dessert which was a shame as the desserts looked divine! All in all we had a great experience! A few weeks later we had to try the Gibson's in Rosemont as well. (just as great!)
Although we had to wait an hour after our reservation time due to previous patrons lingering at the table, our party of 6 really enjoyed the pianist in the bar who is excellant. I can't say enough about this great experience and the food and service were impeccible.
For Southerners, this was an exciting visit to a quintessential Chicago icon. We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our dinner. The restaurant is crowded and noisy, but your fellow guests are interesting and entertaining. We were told it is a place to see and be seen. The steaks are excellent (not the best ever but still top shelf). Service was very good. Side items are sized to share. The desert is too big for 2 - our table of 8 shared one big desert! For steak lovers, the ribeye has another name and is served bone-in. From the steaks presented, there seemed little difference in what they call T-Bone vs Porterhouse. It appears they designate Porterhouse by the size of the filet muscle (vs. presence or absence of longisimus costarum muscle) We all had filet minion which typically I take medium. Half was medium, with half medium-rare. The flavor was excellent and I always eat my steaks without sauce, etc. The meat should speak for itself and it did. Gibson's has it's own USDA designation for Prime which is a bit less marbled than a traditional prime. It is more like Choice marbling. The steaks had excellent flavor, body, and texture. Something you would expect in a good steakhouse. We ordered twice baked potato (excellent), creamed spinach (very good) and asparagus (too mature) for sides. Overall the whole experience was fun. If I was going to a steakhouse for a wonderful steak, I might try another restaurant next time - nothing against Gibson's but it wasn't the best steak I've ever had - probably top 10 though. But it was excellent and the whole evening was made better by our start at Gibson's!
We enjoy our annual post Thanksgiving Chicago pilgrimage for shopping, sightseeing and steak dinners. While we have several favorite steak restaurants we will always put Gibson's as a not-to-miss first priority. This year's dining experience was exceptional, starting with an accommodating barman and a hostess who, upon learning of a hearing problem, took time to locate a quieter table for us. The bone-in filet was the best we've experienced, the sides were huge, and we had to forgo their signature desserts this year. Only once in many years, when we arrived before opening, were there any empty tables, so be prepared to enjoy your meal with lots of company. The servers were attentive and enthusiastic. It works best to call ahead for reservations, even if it's only an hour or two before you want to arrive; otherwise seating is hit or miss, We would not rate this as a particularly quiet romantic choice nor an easy place to take a large group for a special occasion.
Had a wonderful 7oz filet with perfectly cooked broccoli and i was trying to stay a bit with the diet, but ended up having to have the bernaise sauce which was delicious. Also, it came with a good sized salad. Also, gave into the delicious fresh bread and butter. Gave up the idea of dieting..but well worth it. Couple of blocks from several downtown hotels.
My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at Gibsons with our daughter last week. The atmosphere and service were outstanding. For a high end steakhouse I was a little disappointed with the food. It was high quality, tasty and cooked to order, but I didn't get that WOW factor that I was expecting from a place with the reputation that Gibsons has earned. Maybe my expectations were too high. Overall it was a great evening and I would celebrate another special event at Gibsons.
My husband and I celebrated our anniversary with dinner at Gibson's in Oak Brook. Our expectations were high and were exceeded. The services was impeccable. Our server was thorough and even gave honest opinions when asked. She did not try to sell the most expensive item on the menu. The food came out quick and hot. My husband's steak was done perfectly while my tilapia was flaky and delicious. I would recommend the seared steak appetizer, unbelievably delicious! Only minor concern was how crowded and loud it was. But after awhile, it added to the charm of Gibson's. Would recommend to anyone!
We had lunch here on Halloween. We had reservations several nights before for dinner, but had to cancel because our flight was delayed. I am so glad we made the effort to get there for lunch. The food was amazing! Everyone had the stone crab bisque, which was very good. For entrees, I had the seafood chopped salad, which was huge and flavorful. My husband and one of our friends had the ahi tuna sandwich with wasabi mayo and homemade sweet potato chips and they both raved about it. My SIL had the stone crap salad, and she loved it. BIL had the fish & chips and he said it was very good. The best part of the meal was the desserts. Our waiter offered half slices of pie, which three of us took him up on. They were huge! I had the key lime, and it was by far the best key lime pie I have ever eaten. The service was great too. Very attentive without being fussy. Our waiter had a great sense of humor. Oh, and the bloody Marys were excellent too...
The steak was a good piece of meat, but it wasn't seasoned at all. The salads and sides were pretty ordinary and quite over priced, I thought.My husband had Salmon and said it was marginal. I won't return with so many other options in Chicago. We really liked Fish Bar for lunch and Wild Fire (We didn't order steaks at Wild Fire though because we knew we were going to Gibson's). Definitely didn't live up to the hype.
You know, you can roll out a lot of superlatives about Chicago. It's New York City without the pretentiousness. OK, maybe it's missing a couple other things, too, but it's a great city. So, too, are some of its great restaurants and Gibson's is just that. The food is excellent, the crowd is boisterous, they don't short you on the drinks, and the service is normally outstanding. It's also located in the heart of the nightlife area inhabited by tourists and those who make Chicago tick. In other words, if you're looking for a place to hang out with the artsy crowd, well, this ain't it. I love this Gibson's.
I'll cut to the chase. We're here for the steak. Bone in strip and filet, wet aged, the best steak I've ever had and I've had a lot of steak at a lot of great steak houses. Went at 7pm on Saturday but dress was casual. I was wearing shorts from a day at the science museum. The place was packed and loud, it was not unpleasant though. Meal comes with salad. The desserts are excellent and very, very, large. None of us could endure a dessert after that steak. We went back the next day and five of us shared a chocolate mousse cake. The staff was excited to hear we came back just for dessert. Service was excellent. We will go back when we're in Chicago. Make a reservation if you want a seat.
Went to Chicago for a business trip and my colleague (a local from Chicago) took me to Gibson's. This is a great steakhouse overall...Service was excellent - staff was very friendly and knowlegeable about steak cuts and wine pairings. Great place for business dinner, take your family as well as for a romantic dinner. Notice that there are a lot of locals that usually hang out at their bar... Most clients were having business dinner.
Staying at a hotel close to Gibson's, we popped into the restaurant without a reservation one recent weekday afternoon and were glad we did! They were busy, but able to supply a table instantly. Seated at a spacious banquette in the thick of the lunchtime crowd, my husband, teenage son and I enjoyed a terrific lunch of steak sandwiches and their special Bookbinder's soup, all delicious. My sandwich, which was the French Dip, was outstanding and loaded with meat. My son's Rib Eye was a hit, accompanied by fantastic crispy fries, enough for us to share. The service was excellent. Nearby tables seemed to be enjoying themselves and the food in this old world Chicago atmopshere. Seems there were a lot of loyal regulars there too. This is a solid restaurant with professional staff. We loved it.
From the location (practically epicenter to the viagra triangle) to the menu to the staff you will not be disappointed. The oysters were excellent and fresh. I have had the Filet Mignon, NY Strip, brazilian lobster tail and quite a few other selections off the menu. All are excellent, especially the 3lb tail! Excellent wine list to mtach. Must save room for the desert! The desert tray is always the same, but what is on it is quite unique and specialized. Worth every penny.
We really enjoyed the dining experience at Gibsons. The food was very good and large servings. The staff was attentive. I was surprised when I got the bill that it was only around 30 per person. As usual there were several local celebs (sports,politicians, etc). The deserts were INSANE. I mean holy cow the size of their cakes were just incredible.
Was in Chicago for a convention and arranged to meet an old friend here. Classic steak house. Large portions and even larger prices. Entrees are all on the higher end of the $15-80 tag listed on TripAdvisor. Cheapest steak on the menu was around $40. The lobster tails were huge, including the largest I had ever seen, and while probably good for two was priced at $115 ! Salads were fresh and tasty, and the Baked potato was large enough to share. Waiter was attentive and knowledgable, but conveyed unhappiness via body language when we didn't order drinks or dessert and run the tab even higher. Overall: great for the experience, or special occasion, but not for a steady diet.
Got a table reserved for 7pm for four in the morning. On arrival we have to wait few minutes! Tables are too close! Everybody is talking loudly while waiters are really shouting. It's fun to listen to the shouting waiters dramatizing the menu~ We understood only half of the menu story of our friendly African American waiter. However we agree with him that their steak was the best. Since the portions were huge we shared the steak and lobsters. It was the most delicious steak I had in Chicago~ it was fun, easy, fast, delicious and value for money!!
First visit to a place who's name I've known for years but never had the pleasure to enjoy. Their reputation of being a top tier steakhouse is well founded. Can't speak to the "crowds" reviewed by others but frankly, most places worth it have crowds. I arrived at 7:00pm and found an empty stool at the bar, quickly greated by friendly bartenders while talkative still had that edge that lets you know it's their place and you're in good hands. Piano player provided pleasant entertainment for bar area. Generous pour on martini's. Wedge salad was good and would please any wedge fan. Other patrons were enjoying the avocado crab appetizer which they all raved about. Ribeye was cooked perfectly and had great beef flavor, served with house speciality twice baked potato that is large enough for 2 people. I'm a big eater and accepted a friendly challenge from bartender to finish the entire potato myself but fell slightly short. Overall good place and would recommend. Situated on Rush Street so plenty of happenings around as well.
I even tried an alcoholic drink which I have done in decades loaded up on appetizers and a whiskey sour and everything was top notch The service was great ( female) in the bar area right in front of the door is where we sat because there is not a seat to be had but dont let that stop you it didnt stop us we'll be back
This was a must see on a recent trip to Chicago. Locals galore, great outside dining and people watching. Homemade smoked salmon to die for! Friendly and helpful staff, historic photos on the wall, a very busy but efficient place! Reasonable prices for lunch, very happening place at dinner. Ate there twice!
My son and I were in Chicago for the wk end and with luck got a Fri night reservation! The service was WONDERFUL, the manager even took time to stop by our table and chat. More surprising, the Chef took a few minutes to speak with us!! Everything we ate was memorable. We had the wood fired oysters, fried oysters, green beans, scallops and grilled chicken with the fried pickles. The rhubarb dessert was the perfect end to our experience! If we went back we would both find it hard to try other items as we so enjoyed everything we were served. Be aware that the restaurant is loud, but it is filled with happy diners enjoying food and "drink".......we did NOT find that a problem. And, speaking of "drink", be sure to check out their specialty drinks....... inventive and refreshing .
With all of the hype associated w/a tough-to-get reservation, sometimes you're wary by the time you get to go. It was my birthday so I hoped for the best. First, I appreciated the lack of pretension. At 5:30 on a Friday night, the restaurant was packed and everyone seemed happy to be there. Our server was quirky & charming. Also enjoyed chatting w/charming GM Tony. We shared 6 small plates - all really good. Favorites: goat empanadas, shoshito peppers, grilled octopus w/roasted pistachios. Very good wine too. 100% worth the hype.
I just had my fifth meal at this place, and as usual, I was not disappointed. It is a great place for innovative American cuisine. Service is always outstanding and I appreciate the knowledge & the patience of the servers. I have some dietary restrictions, and the servers always take the time to point out what options I have on the menu. It is also incredibly affordable. I usually order a drink, the bread, several small plates (which usually I share with my dining companions) and dessert and I leave spending between 40-50 dollars, including a 20% tip. My favorite dishes from my last visit include the sauteed green beans, roasted cauliflower, chickpea fritters & scallops. My friends also had the leg of goat (which you must preorder 24 hours in advance) and have not stopped raving about it. Bread costs extra, but it is worth it. Its always good. In a city that is jam packed with interesting and outstanding dining options, the Girl & the Goat is one of my favorites. Well done.
Lots of "top chef" buzz. Must get reservations. Can walk in pretty easily around 5, tho. Small plate, locally sourced dining. Beef cheeks and other tempting things to try. Loud. Extremely knowledgable staff. Completely non-traditional.
I called for reservations a few days before our Saturday visit, fully aware that we probably wouldn't be able to get reservations. The hostess was extremely nice and told me if we arrived when they opened at 4:30 we should be able to get a seat. That's what we did and we got in without a problem. Our experience was outstanding. Our server, Brennan, really made our night that much better. Besides having a personality that fit well with ours, he was knowledgeable about all facets of the restaurant and took his time explaining details we asked about. The kohirabi salad is a can't be missed starter. We also enjoyed the wood grilled broccoli and the pig face. We had an amazing dinner and can't wait to go back with friends!
Great spot. Energetic space, interesting cocktails, good selection & quality of wines by the glass, and small plates, which allow diners to sample many dishes. Lastly, despite the restaurant's name, extensive vegetarian & vegan options. Hard to get reservations, but they do accept walk ins when they open. Highly recommended!
You have to make reservations well in advance but it is worth it. The staff was attentive and informative as I needed some explanations of some of the menu items. The Pig Face for example..don't let that scare you off, it was basically an extremely flavorful pulled pork. I had the Kohlrabi salad comprised of fennel, Evalon goat cheese, toasted almonds, and blueberries with a ginger dressing. The menu changes frequently as they like to get fresh local ingredients. The atmosphere is casual with a slightly trendy neighborhood vibe. Everything we ate was fantastic, the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was great.
I digress. GATG was great and creative food, good prices, well worth it.;. i, however, have disappointment with intimidating with over-the-top know-it-all wait staff who act like authorities but really don't know something but will just say something authoritative and intimidating. Our smuggish wait person told us that the reason their craft beer was not cold was "we serve it only cooled" (rudely, with no further explanation offered, as though that is the foodie way and you are a jerk/dolt to think otherwise). Well, i do know my beer stuff (including the ways of the British) and good beer is served very cold if it is to be served properly. Second example- I asked the smuggish wait person about an ingredient- she never came back with an answer, so I asked another server, who went to the chef and promptly returned with an answer. Later the wait person remembered and came with the "answer"- she'd obviously made it up and it was totally the opposite of the first answer to that question. One could say this is a bad apple wait person...or one could say that it is a filter down issue of improper and inadequate training at this high level restaurant. Lastly, the music is deliberately very loud- everyone in the place is always needing to shout to be heard- but this is, i suppose, part of the new 21st century "cool". Enjoy the place- but beware the arrogant wait staff!!
We celebrated my wife's birthday dinner and enjoyed one of our most memorable meals, ever. We shared each dish so sampled six, dessert included. Our salad sounded unremarkable, but the taste (dressing with a hint of ginger) and the texture (crunchy thin fennel, firm fresh blueberries) made it a unique introduction to the menu. We had frogs legs, served on a bed of wilted greens and another interesting dressing that more than made up for the small amount of meat the frogs legs provide. Next came our favorite dish, goat empanadas. These were slightly crisp, golden brown empanadas filled with medium ground, flavored meat -- presumably goat -- served on a bed of garlic, ground almonds (?) and other spices. Again, novel, delicate flavors were complimented by the varied textures of the empanada crust, the meat within, and the mixture on which they were presented. The "diver" scallops were large, cooked to perfection, and served with their own bed of greens and spices. Only when measured against the terrific dishes we had just eaten, did the scallops come out as only average -- solely because of the accompanying greens and spices. We completed the meal with the goat cheesecake, which surely had no goat as an ingredient, but was decadently rich cheesecake topped with creme and drizzled with carmel (cajete), and a serving of pastureized cheese (three sisters) served with two kinds of crisp cracker and sugar coated nut morsels on the side. The place was packed on a Wednesday night, with the bar and waiting area crammed with folks without a reservation. We were seated within five minutes of our reservation (made 1 week in advance on OpenTable -- for the only time slot left available). Other tables of four and six did not seem to be moving; almost no one left while we ate (1.5 hours). That contributed to a noise level I am unaccustomed to in top restaurants. But again, this is a really "happening" place that deserves the hype because it delivers the food. Thank heavens we weren't on a first date, and after 40 years of marriage were happy to just listen and observe the interactions of the many dinners the ages of our kids. The cost was reasonable for the quality of food and number of dishes -- $82 without drinks.
For this restaurant there are not enough superlatives to adequately describe it. We ordered (and shared) the Crab Cakes and Lobster Tail Tempura, accompanied by an excellent Albarino wine. Starting off, the bread basket was outstanding - 5 types of bread, of which the white roll was the only "ordinary" offering - sour dough with a chewy crust would have made it 5 for 5. The salad was served with REAL Roquefort dressing, not some blue cheese imitation. The vegetable dish, steamed asparagus with lemon-butter sauce, was absolutely perfect. The seafood was cooked to perfection, and the shared entrees divided in the kitchen and served attractively and were delicious - the lobster was just right. To finish off, the coffee service (enough for two cups each) and deserts were delectable. I had their signature Lime Key Pie, while my wife opted for a decadent half-slice (more than enough) of a chocolate fudge pie a la mode. We left there stuffed, and very, very happy. In my opinion, the meal was worth more than we paid. Our waitress was Liz Abrams - I'm sure they are all excellent, but her service was worth a special mention,
I loved watching Stephanie on Top Chef and loved it even more when she won. So I'll fully admit being a little star struck when my husband and I recently checked out her fabulous new restaurant -- and she was there. I'll also admit that I went in thinking I'd like it and wanting to like it, but my bias aside, it really is a phenomenal restaurant. The vibe of this place is great. It's a little trendy and I like that it's dimly lit and the bar scene is buzzing. We were there for dinner but I could definitely see going there just for drinks (although you'd probably be compelled to order food, too). We had to wait a few minutes for our table so we saddled up to the bar and ordered a few cocktails. To be completely honest, I cannot remember the cocktail that I ordered, but I do remember thoroughly enjoying it. We were pleasantly surprised that when it came time to be seated, we were taken to two of the four best seats in the house, overlooking the kitchen -- literally. It's like you're at a counter service joint only better, and the line cooks like to chat it up with whoever is sitting there. It was such a fun experience to watch them work their magic. And, as I mentioned, Stephanie was there completely watching over everything. I was very impressed to see her expediting and interacting with the staff and at times, customers. Onto the food... everything was wonderful, so I'll just touch on my favorites. The sauteed green beans were by far one of the best dishes we had. Green beans? Yes, green beans. They didn't even really catch our eye when we were perusing the menu, but they came highly recommended from our waiter, so we decided to give them a whirl. So happy we did. They were really outstanding, which I'm sure was due to the fish sauce vinaigrette. The grilled beef short ribs with edamame were also very good. When they were served, we were told that Stephanie really wants you to get in there and get messy with them, which is good, because you kind of have to. I don't recall ever sucking meat from a bone at a restaurant before, but I did. Didn't want to miss a single bit! Other dishes worth noting are the crudo with crisp pork belly and the smoked goat pizza.
I took my girlfriend to Girl and the Goat for her birthday and we were both really excited about trying this often talked about restaurant. First impressions, really cool decor, table was ready for us immediately with our reservation time, and lively atmosphere. But, the food was why we came. I gave Girl and the Goat 4 stars instead of 5 because while some dishes were truly out of this world, others were just solid. My girlfriend and I ate what the waiter called, "an ambitious" ordering of plates because we wanted to try so many things. We did try a lot of different things from duck tongue to pork belly to kohlrabi salad. Seafood, carne, and everything in between. My girlfriend and I both thought that for the money, Girl and the Goat was worth it. It did not break the bank, but was not exactly cheap either. I would totally recommend Girl and the Goat, but as far as fine dining in Chicago, I do not think it is quite 5 star, perhaps if we ordered different items it would have been. Highlights: Porkbelly, Kohlrabi salad, sweet bread (if you don't order this, you are a fool), Baby Octopus Not so highlights: Duck tongue (this was our gamble dish and it did not pay off=worst dish of the night), ceviche (I love ceviche, lived in Latin America for two years, and while this was not bad ceviche by any means, it was not outstanding either) Final note... The service was outstanding, one of the best waitresses I have ever had in a restaurant... funny, engaging, knew when to walk away and leave us alone and when we wanted to chat... I wish I could remember her name, but she was FANTASTIC!
Okay so the place had a three month wait and we just got to Chicago and decided we wanted to give it a shot. The concierge at our hotel said that sometimes they have seating for walk-ins that come early. We got there at around 6 o'clock parked on valet parking spot for $10 and walked right into the front right next to the kitchen. In many restaurants being next to the kitchen is not a good thing this place hasn't totally open kitchen sink and see everything there cooking bother doing it it's an amazing ambience! My husband and I sat with a group of another six people at a huge dining room table made of old beautiful wood and had the best night I can remember in a long time. We had three appetizers two main courses I side dish and dessert beer and wine and the whole bill was $85! We're actually going to go back again tomorrow night because the food was on believable and delicious every single thing we ate was flawless. I'm a foodie but my husband is not and I've never been out to a restaurant with him were all he kept saying over and over again is oh my God!
After waiting 4 months, we finally had a reservation at a decent time, but on a Monday night. It was crowded, and the place is happening. It's a great space and has a fun atmosphere. The food is unique and very tasty. I like that it was a small plate thing so you can taste a lot of items, but wished the small plates had a little bit more food. The server recommended 4-5 plates for 2 people, but I felt like we could have eaten twice that many of plates and probably would have if they wouldn't have been so pricy. I'm sure the prices were determined by the unique ingredients, but I feel like there should be a bit more food. Not quite a place for value, but definitely worth a visit!
This truly was an amazing highlight of our day on a rainy Chicago day. A very packed and happening place. We were worried this place would be over-hyped but it went far and beyond for the needs of foodies. We started with bread with duck fat butter and berry jam and it took off from there...bartenders were as unforgettable as the food. Each dish was perfect size for the two of us to share. We had several dishes like beet salad, grilled octopus, pig face, one of the goat dish specials, etc. We'd go back in a heartbeat.
Small Plates of yummy food. We ordered 4 "small plates" not really small , of Green beans, Roasted Beets, Scallops and of course Goat, all beautifully cooked in interesting sauces. Excellent wait staff, who do not push you to order too much. Extremely busy on Saturday night but they had casual seating round the bar that we sat down in and were served in very quickly
It must be my age.......but I enjoy having a plate of food placed in front of me. I don't have to worry about about taking more than my share and shuffling food around the table. Not to say that the food wasn't delish and interesting. I especially enjoyed the pork belly and pork shank. It was worth the drive and putting on a nice frock was fun. The restaurant reminded me of a ski lodge. However, tables are close and the noise level is high on Sat. evening. Would I go again.......maybe.
Went to visit girl friends in Chicago,(As a former Chicagoan, I wanted to go here since I watched Stephanie win Top Chef) was told no way we'd get in without reservations 8 weeks in advance.....found out walk ins can sit at the bar or the very low table and bench area up front...first come, first serve. Got there early, the regular bar was full, we sat at the VERY low table bench set up ( don't wear a short skirt) Great waitress, went on a Sunday night, Had A loooong wait between courses with different food runners bringing each order. The fish crudo with crispy pork belly was amazing, as were desserts, ( goat milk cheese cake was the bomb) Cocktails are wicked, but pricy. Three women with three cocktails a piece and a not huge assortment of dishes was 300 before tax and tip. We lingered and chatted and people watched for almost three hours with no rush out the door, which was very nice.
This resto was the "must go" destination on a recent girl's trip to Chicago, and it didn't disappoint. In fact, it was a highlight of the trip. Even on a Sunday night at 9:00 in the middle of a rainstorm, the place was packed and buzzing. I was worried it didn't live up to they hype, but it so did and more. We chose our plates and they brought them to us in perfectly paired order. The second last pairing - the cauliflower and chicken together were outstanding, I wanted to lick the plates clean. And then, I wanted to cry it was gone. It truly was that good. I cannot recommend this resto enough - the flavours were unlike anything I've ever had. Do yourself a favour and go.
My November reservation was placed in August. Yes, that far in advance. Do not plan to just show up and hope to get in. With that said, so worth the wait. The menu is split in three categories, V F M. The waitress will suggest sharing 2 to 3 plates per person. We ordered 6 which ended up being too much and asked to cancel the final item. The plates are brought out one at a time and spaced out by the kitchen. Our favorites: Shrimp, ham fries, broccoli The menu does change often, so don't get attached to one item. Bottomline, the food combinations we amazing. The sharing portions were larger than expected. The place is very loud, so not for an intimate date. We were so close to the table next door that we learned all about their children and travels. Overall, an amazing dining experience.
Great lunch with my bride at Joe's today for lunch. $66 (w/o tip) for stone crab lunch w dessert and filet with dessert. Potatoes and cole slaw was included. The coleslaw is by far hands down the best I've had and my wife loved the crab!! Waitress very knowledgeable about the menu and Chicago. Will come back for sure!
I'm looking at the reviews on this page, and it leads me to wonder what everyone who gave a negative review ate, coz everything we ordered was outstanding. We did not make reservations (a group of four), so they said it was a 2 hour wait. We requested a table, went back to our hotel, freshened up, and then returned, almost close to midnight for the best dining experience - comparable to Mario Batali's Babo in NY (some dishes even outdid that restaurant). We ordered the pig face (of course), lived up to all the hype, so much so that we ordered seconds lol. The tempura fried softshell crab on an eggsalad (makes no sense, I know), but was ridiculously good. Escargot ravioli: delicious. The goat empanadas - didn't even taste like any goat I've had ever before, was scrumptious. The only dish that didn't really like was the chicken. Even the goat cheese cake for desert was amazing. As for ambiance, it was rustic, lively and hip. Our waiter was super helpful - treated us like old friends. The prices were reasonable. Overall, an amazing culinary experience, the only disappointment was having missed Antony Bourdain who went to the restaurant the very next day to shoot the layover!
Rather spur of the moment, my friend and I decided to stop at Quartino for dinner. We were told there was about a 30+ minute wait but it ended up being much quicker than that. I can't vouch for inside since we were seated at the end of the outdoor patio, which I was thrilled about. My meal was perfect for the warm spring evening. I started with the assortment of 3 kinds of marinated olives and a glass of Prosecco. Then, I moved onto their Margherita pizza and it was delicious! It came out super fast (after being told pizzas take 10-15 minutes to arrive, it was out in 2. No lie.) and was piping hot and oh so tasty. Highly recommend it! However, my friend was not so lucky. Somehow, her pizza ended up taking about an hour to arrive. :( I think it was a miscommunication - we'd heard food runners ask neighboring tables if they'd ordered a pizza and they hadn't. Our waiter was fairly attentive but he was busy - though he could have been better about making sure that pizza was out asap after he noticed she hadn't eaten 30 minutes later. Nevertheless, the pizza was taken off the bill and he apologized many times so its all good - this wouldn't deter me from eating there again next time I was in Chicago...mistakes happen sometimes, right? Quartino also had a great wine and specialty cocktails list, a gluten-free menu, and some *amazing* looking desserts. The prices were very reasonable too (pizzas were $10-$12)...I was expecting it to be pricier. If you're in the mood for some good Italian food, this is a wonderful choice.
Service is quick without rushing. Homemade tortellini in alfredo sauce with fresh peas & prosciutto (I held that) = divine. Had a Peroni to wash it all down. Sangria (all wines) are served by the 1/4, 1/2, or liter. Had the red sangria & it was fine, nothing amazing. Overall it was a delightful little restaurant with authentic Italian taste. Noisy.
The food is great - as the waiters will explain, you order 1-2 items per person & share it all family style. The food comes as it's ready so things are constantly arriving - which actually makes tasting the different items easier to do. The staff is friendly & efficient - very efficient. Six of us were in and out for dinner on a Friday night in a little over an hour - not a place to linger. Things move very fast & the noise level is high. This is NOT a quiet, romantic date kind of place, though it does seem to be a very hip, happening scene with lots of attractive people mixing and mingling.
We went more than once for lunch to this place while we were in Chicago: the food was very good (especially the thin crust pizzas) and extremely reasonably priced (as was the wine), the service good and friendly (without being gushy), and the atmosphere lively. The restaurant produces a number of its own products, such as 'duck prosciutto'. We did find it was necessary to state very clearly that we did not want main courses arriving whilst we were still eating starters, though. The only drawback - no vino santo in which to dip the excellent biscotti.
Ate here on a Monday night, but it was still crowded, but not over-packed. Loud, but happening. We have been here on several occaisions and always enjoy the meal. We had several small plates- calamari, risotto, and a pizza, along with a nice Chianti. Waitstaff were very personable and attentive.
We showed up at 8:30 on a Friday night in December and there was a 2 hour wait for a table, so we sat at a table in the bar (lucky to have grabbed one!). We had a very good waitress who recommended wine, entrees, and dessert. She was right on the money each time, too! Both of our pastas were delicious. The house salad was crisp and had the right amount of ingredients, along with the fresh, light balsamic dressing. The chocolate fondue was fun and different! Give this place a try, as long as you can put up with the noise level. I'm in my 50's and was one of the oldest people there. Really, it's fun!
Our first night in the city and we were not sure what we wanted....so we started walking from our hotel and stubbled across the Quartino. We almost did not eat there...what a mistake that would have been. This a GREAT Italian restaurant that will not break your bank and you will leave extremely satisfied. There motto "Where the Wine is Cheaper Than Water...and the Pizza is The Finest." One feature is the wine. Each month they feature bottled wines that they price at $20.00/bottle. We had the Merlot one night and the Red Zin the other. Both were very tasty and this is coming from a couple of wine snobs. The food is designed to share. We had the Veal Osso Bucco. This is a MUST. We make a version at home and have yet to find one that we like better than ours and this one came very close. We also had the sausage Risotto and the romaine salad. Both good choices. We also had to have dessert. I can not remember the name, but it was vanilla Gelato, with bananas and chocolate...yummy! Over all with tip the dinner was $58 and some change. We went back one more night and had the pizza. We were not disappointed.
Outstanding wines for cheap, and the small plates let you try a bunch of new things without breaking the bank, or your expanding your gut. It will be loud and crowded, but it is worth it for what you get.
My husband and I ate here and it was our favorite place we ate at the whole trip (and we ate at places where the bill was much higher than this place). If you like trying a bunch of different meals or trying to keep your meal costs down in Chicago, this is the place to stop at. They give you smaller portions of things but the price is lower than a full entree. But the portion sizes are not that small (2 people can get a good amount out of 2-3 plates) that you would leave starved. We started off with a antipasto plate (you get to pick what you want on it.. build it yourself) and moved onto 2 entress and a pizza. Then we had dessert which was very good (doughnuts were fabulous). You can order the food as you go and they bring them out when they are ready so you can stop when you are full and try to keep 1 order in as you get near finishing the previous order. The wine is good and not very expensive.
My wife and I visited Joe's during Labor Day Weekend 2011. We got a reservation a couple weeks in advance. Make sure to do that. When we got there at 5:30, they said they were booked til 9:30. I like to think of Joe's as a really formal place (casual business attire), but the food is pretty normal. Even though it was very pricy, it was a fun way to end our trip in Chicago.
Great food...great service...live restaurant with lots of action, while priced very well. You've got to try this place. Italian food with a twist, tapis style, which you normally find in a Spanish type of restaurant. Begin with some cheese to snack on and move onto some entrees. Small portions that you share. Everyone can order and share their dish. You get to taste a lot of different foods and you have to try the chocolate fondue. Highly recommend this place.
We had a lovely experience at Quartino last night. I was dining with two small children (one very picky), my husband, and my mother-in-law. I stumbled upon this restaurant because it is so close to the condo where we are staying. We quickly were seated, and the server described the tapas style menu to us. My 4 year old was acting a little crabby because he just awoke from a nap..We had promised him chocolate milk. Well, they didn't have any. They had an employee go to 7-11 and buy some for him!!!! We never would have asked them to do that, they just did it!!! Such nice service!! The food was fantastic. Just enough to share for each person. We started with the cheese stuffed dates, wrapped in prosciutto. Delicious. Then on to pizza margherita with a lovely crispy crust. The veal skirt steak was fantastic, as was the shrimp risotto. We shared a great bottle of Malbec, that was reasonably priced. Later, I'm not sure if it was the front of house manager, or not- but a manager type came over and chatted with us about our visit to Chicago. He was so super nice!! His name is Nicholas Haubrich. If you get a chance to go, chat with him- he was great. I never review restaurants!! This is the first time, and I'm a foodie. That should tell you how great this place is!! Enjoy!
We went on Friday night to celebrate three family birthdays . There were 9 adults and a baby. What fun we had ! The food was delcious. It is served on small plates with great bread. The service was good. . They did take reservations for a large group so no wait even on a Friday night. A very enjoyable , delicious, fun experience. We will definitely go back. It is very noisy with all of the conservation about the food and the sharing so not the place if you want a quiet , romantic dinner or want to be able to have a long conversatiion at dinner with someone . It is the PERFECT place for all ages if you want to have a FUN dining experience that included great food and great wait staff ! We enjoyed how each dish comes out when it is ready so you are constantly eating something different . Kudos to Aldo , our waiter , he was wonderful It was very reasonable price wise for all the food and drink that we had ! We will go back again when we are in Chicago with family.
Excellent dining, we enjoyed a small family gathering at Quartino on a busy Saturday afternoon during Chicago holiday shopping. Our server was wonderful and brought just what we needed for our 4 yr old grandchild...a half order of linguine marinara with one of Quartino's favorite, a veal meatball...if you have never had a veal meatball you are definitely in for a treat. All the grandparents shared two pizzas, margarita and mushroom. Quartino uses fresh portabello mushrooms...delicious...we also ordered a veal dish and a risotto both were great choices. I would recommend Quartino for great food and staff...valet parking is also a plus.
Here is a place that is a combination of a bar and a nice elegant two story restaurant. The menu has a wide array of items to choose from, as well as, the price ranges. In other words, all budgets can fit in here. It is walking distance from parking and to the Hard Rock Cafe. Oh yeah, Chicago women are attractive. Great place to take a date or with friends or family - at least that is what I got to observe.
This was a wonderful restuarant we stumbled across. We came without a reservation, but since they have a nice bar area, we didn't mind waiting. The wait wasn't long and we got the best outdoor table. We ordered pizzas, and from the first bite, I fell in love -- it was WONDERFUL! The service was attentive but not intrusive. And guests would feel equally comfortable dressed up or casual. There are few places that I will remember so fondly from our Chicago weekend as this great little restaurant. We will be back!
Visited Chicago recently and this restaurant was suggested by our concierge. It turned out to be a great meal and love that they offered half portions!!! Meal was great, service wonderful and friendly.... Would definitely go if I'm in Chicago again....
My friend & I found Quartino's while out walking in the morning. The menu brought us back to eat there that evening. It was a Saturday night, very busy. We requested outdoor seating, the hostess guessed the wait to be one hour. It was very packed inside, but we got to the bar and ordered a bottle of wine. Our name was called in less than one hour. The waiter explained that the food comes out as ready. You share this dish, and wait for the next food item to arrive. We were not very hungry so we ordered a pizza to share. The pizza was fine, a simple thin crust with nice toppings. Similiar to what most italian restaurants serve. I think the share food concept would work great with a larger group (some people may not like this idea) my family & friends tend to do this when we eat out. The prices were very affordable for such a nice restaurant in a large city. Our bottle of wine was only $15, yes there was much higher wine, we were happy with our choice. I would return to this restaurant in a minute. If you don't want a heavy meal, there are plenty of small bites to choose.
Food, service, staff, and drinks were fabulous. Their martini's were smooth. We had reservations fr inside but changed to the outside. Tomato soup to start, cavatelli and pork shank. Wow so tender. Bread and oil for dipping. Wine list affordable and great choice.
When we entered the restaurant we were a little overwhelmed by the noise: There are lots of big tables for 6 or more people and the sound volume was incredible! We both chose to go for a Pizza each. The waiter advised us to share one because of the size (about 12in). In the end one Pizza wasn't enough so in addition we ordered meatballs and tomato-soup. The pizza was european-style, the soup was okay, the meatballs were delicious.
We came across this when we ran a search on tripadvisor for restaurants in Chicago and have to say that we were not disappointed in the quality of food and service at this fine restaurant. We made a reservation a month in advance for 8pm on a Monday night but my friend managed to get a different table for 8:30pm the very same evening so there could be better availability on weekdays. The restaurant looked fairly busy when we arrived, empty tables were not obvious. We were promptly shown to our table and our server was very helpful with recommendations. My 2 friends had the 'surf and turf' combo for around $55 - Alaskan king crab legs (pre-peeled for your delectation) and a cut of beef, and I had the dover sole for around $43 and the crab soup ($8) which was simply sublime. I would say the king crab legs are definitely not to be missed (for a much cheaper option in a trashy diner setting, look up Half Shell). The restaurant was filled with a business-looking crowd so definitely a more upper class setting. Ideal for dates, business dinners or catching up with a group of friends. Service and ambience were excellent - I'd highly recommend it if you don't mind splashing out on a meal!
Great food and atmosphere! I grew up in a NYC Italian family and I'm very particular when it comes to Italian food. My wife and 2 kids (15 & 20) also loved it. Our waiter "Will" was great. We had a minor problem getting a wheelchair guest to the restroom on the 2nd floor. The elevator was difficult to get to due to it's location and navigating through the tables so we went outside and in the side door to get to the elevator but the restrooms and restaurant were handicap accessible.
Although it was raining, the view from this delightful restaurant on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Center (enter on Chestnut just east of Michigan in the Magnificent Mile) is spectacular, and eating here saves the $11 entry fee for the Observatory! The Sunday brunch ($42, alcoholic drinks extra) is in the same top class! What a spread: from made-to-order omelets, breakfast meats of every description, eggs Benedict, potatoes, grits, (but no scrambled eggs in a steamer!), fruit, cheese, seafood - fish and shellfish in abundance - pate, sauces and toppings beyond counting, hot dishes to make any mouth water, pastries and wonderful rolls galore, to a carving station offering ham and medium rare prime rib! Then there were the deserts, which we never got to; we filled up on the good stuff! The buffet, on both sides of a narrower part of the south side of the building (there may have been another on the north side; we never got there) ran for at least 100 feet. And service was superb, just wonderful; no wait to have your coffee refilled, a used plate removed or silver replaced. The buffet was in constant replenishment, and everything was cordial and oh so correct. Marvelous, just MARVELOUS!
Dinner at sunset was lovely - fantastic view of the city and the lake. The food was fine - not fantastic, but good solid food. The prices were - even by Chicago standards - outrageous. Service was pretty good. I would probably recommend going to the bar on the 96th floor and saving your money. One pretty major downside - the trip up and down in the elevators. You'll be competing with people going to the bar and the new observation decks - getting up was no big deal, but it took us half an hour to get an elevator down!
Went here for a special occasion dinner and honestly the experience and view cannot be beat. Upon arriving at the Hancock tower, there was a line about a mile long to use the elevator to go to the lounge and restaurant. I approved the guard as I was unsure if that was where i was supposed to be and he asked if I had reservations and when I told him yes, he told me to go to the front of the line and the hostess would greet us and take us right up which she did and we were seated within 5 minutes. Reservations are a must and you will have zero issues. There were tons of people waiting and we walked right in so worth a little prior planning. Food was great, service was great and had the most amazing view from the women's restroom. I bet that will be the only time you hear that! Pricey but great for special occasions.
We celebrated 20th anniv. with another couple on the 18th of this month. It was just an excellent experience. The service was outstanding. We had at least 5 people who serviced our table. all were very cordial and fun. Even though the place was packed, they made us feel we were the only ones. The food is much above average. it was not cheap to eat there and might be bit pricey. (drinks especially) But it is worth it for the experience and the view.
Had NY Strip (huge) and roasted chicken (which was better than the much hyped chicken at Thomas Keller's Bouchon). Starter salads were very fresh and not over dressed. Excellent food - steak cooked perfectly, excellent service. However our food took forever to come out. Avoid KALE side dish - spicy and not cut into small pieces (i.e. giant pieces you have to chew through). Mashed potatoes and mushroom side dishes are good. Special simple candle dessert for anniversaries / birthdays etc - let host know if it's a special occasion when making reservation.
For $17.95 each we had a great steak & frites plus got a window view on the 95th floor! For $17 each we could have gone to the 96th floor observation deck and had the same view but without the food... Not a hard choice! Very friendly staff and the food was fantastic! The view.. perfect! We ate there for lunch and a beautiful sunny day. I would recommended reservations.
I love this place. Perfect for a speical night out. View is gorgeous, I have been here at night which is spectacular and on a cloudy day which for a view is different. It is like eating on a cloud. Food is good but not fabulous, there are better places to eat in the city. Service is great, ambiance is lovely
While you can bet on close to a $100 per person...this is a great place worth the price for a special occasion. While I would only give the food a 7-8 on a 10 scale considering the price. The view is a 12 on that scale and makes up for it. I would suggest going right at sundown to enjoy the city lighting up - plus the east side of the restaurant provides the best views. I haven't seen it...but for the ladies, the view from the bathroom is supposed to be the best in Chicago from anywhere.
Instead of waiting for hours to get on top of Willis Tower (which can take up to 3 hrs!) or Hancock Observatory I recommend to have a drink at the Signature Room or lounge. On the 95th and 96th floor of the Hancock Tower visitors can enjoy dinner or just a drink that comes with a jaw-dropping view over Chicago's skyline and vicinity. The costs for a drink or admission to the lookouts is pretty much the same with the difference that your waiting time is much less and you get some booze on top. During the weekend it can happen that both the restaurant and bar are packed but since the drinks are quite expensive most people don't stay long in the bar. Besides, you are allowed to take taking pictures on the 96th floor without having a drink, at least they do not disturb you. I once had drinks at the bar and just recently the chance to attend a reception in the restaurant and both drinks and food were pretty good. Average entree: $35 Cocktails, average: $14 + jaw-dropping view, + delicious Modern American fare, - packed, - expensive
6 of us went around a week ago; we had a 7:30 and were seated around 7:45. I wasn't paying the bill so didn't pay that close of attention but the waiter suggested some appetizers of fresh crab legs and soft shell crabs "best in the city". They brought out too much food, there were even some left when our entrees arrived. We all ordered $40 meals, we all also shared 3 sides and 3 desserts plus one bottle of wine; nothing extravagant. I thought the bill was going to be around $500, low and behold it was $900; it turns out the 2 starters were $350! I know you guys are going to say it was our fault for not asking and you would be correct but to suggest $350 in starters and not warn us was in my opinion a bit much plus the waiter put his tip (18%) on the bill so I suspect he was a bit nervious.
We had 7 people in our group for a lunch there. We ordered different dishes, and, every dish was excellent, with reasonable prices. I ordered the Salad with Lobster. It was beautifully arranged, and very tasteful. Compliment to the Chef! The view from above the city was great! We could see the buildings and the harbor with sailing boats. It was just magnificent. The wait staff was very attentive and courteous. The decor is modern and comfortable. We truly enjoyed that lunch.
What a perfect view of the air and water show. We even had a great view of the storm and lightening, before the show got started. Their tickets included a nice buffet, cocktails and an unforgetable view of the city and the show.
My wife and I had dinner here the Sunday night before Christmas. We had an early reservation (strongly recommend you have one) and were able to get a table next to the windows facing south. The view was terrific and we had a great time looking at the lights of the city. The atmosphere was nice but understand that you will see a cross section of patrons... families, business, couples... in casual to dressy. And it is a little loud at times... this is not an intimate location. The food was what I would expect from a good restaurant in Chicago, but nothing exceptional... there are better choices if the food is your top priority. The wait staff was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Dine here if you want the fun and the event of the location, and a decent meal on the side.
Slight disappointment if I'm honest. Food was great and very professionally served. You just didn't feel like you were a special customer to them. Our servers were very rushed and abrupt. And although I had requested a decent view as it was our honeymoon they put us in the middle of the room at the corner which looks out at the lake. It was after sunset so basically all we could see was black. We might as well have been on the ground. People are only really going to eat here because of the views so it's a shame that some seats have no views at all. Maybe you have to tip the MaitreD hugely to get them. Maybe its luck of the draw and we were just unlucky.
I was advised, like many others, that going to the Signature Lounge instead of paying to go the Observatory is better value for money. It is. You get to relax in a bar that has outstanding views of the city and whilst the drinks are not the cheapest, they certainly are not too extortionate and you can enjoy the view with one or two shandies. Always nice after a hard days sightseeing
Have had many meals here, my most recent during the last weekend of August 2011. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant mostly for the view, but the food is also very good. Brunch or lunch buffet is highly recommended. Service has always been great, even on the upper floor lounge area, where they allow you to just relax and take it all in. Definitely make reservations. I have always had the buffet with champagne. Everything is always very good, from the salmon to the desserts and meat carving stations. I have also entertained clients and family here several times. Yes, it's not cheap, but you are paying for the experience/view as well---and it's the best restaurant view in the entire city. This most recent time, we got a variety of foods/drinks for lunch. Dips, sandwiches, and appetizers shared by the table were all wonderful. They were very prompt and tasted great. Our wine, cocktails and coffee were also prompt and tasty. We didn't spend too much time checking out the atmosphere inside the restaurant because we were focused on the awesome view. Would definitely recommend this for special occasions or for impressing people. Do not recommend for families with young kids or large groups.
Going up to the 95th floor and enjoying the views of Chicago was a real treat. The views are amazing, the service is good and the food was delicious. We asked our hotel to make a reservation for us, which I would strongly recommend as the restaurant was very busy on a Friday night. Having a reservation at the restaurant also meant that we didn't have to queue for the elevator in the building and could go straight up. Otherwise the queue for the elevator for people who only wanted to go to the bar looked like it would be at least half-an-hour wait. We had steak and fish, and both were delicious, also tried their cheesecake for dessert and that was good too. Our waiters were very pleasant and were always at hand when needed. There was a pianist and the atmosphere was great. We asked about the dress-code before we went and were told "business-casual" so wore the best clothes we had with us (as we were travelling). We were glad we asked about this beforehand as most people were dressed very smart. We were slightly surprised when we had to pay for the cloakroom when we picked up our coats - I would have expected this to be free-of-charge - and on top of that the girl in the cloakroom also asked us for a tip as she handed us our coats! Overall though we had a great evening and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
Had reservations for a 7pm dinner and after a little wait for the elevator up, the seating was quick. We were given a beautiful table by the windows and wow, what a view! The food was no less than great, and we even splurged on the 3 tiered shellfish appetizer. A very nice night.
Even though I have visited the Hancock observation deck many many times since it opened in 1969, I was still amazed at the view! We were seated next to a large south window. We were warmly welcomed by the staff and served promptly and courteously - as we would expect at those prices. The buffet was limited, compared to NYC's (now closed) Rainbow Room or The Plaza, but the price includes one prepared dish per person. All six of us had tasty - but not extraordinary - dishes. You pay for the view, but the food is more than adequate. One surprise was that some of the patrons wore sweats, and even "camo"! I'm not one for stuffy dress, (a sweater and khakis) but these folks were nearly disconcerting, and we enjoyed a laugh on them. We alI would visit again.
Chicago "top 10" - Signature Room makes this list 100%. We LOVE Chicago! 1. John Hancock building on Michigan Avenue. Instead of taking the tour for $$$, just go to the 98th floor signature room restaurant/bar. On the 99th floor is a bar where you can order an appetizer and enjoy a great view. OR, the Sunday Brunch on the 95th Floor Signature room is AMAZING with a great view. It is a bit pricey, but it is worth it for a memory you will carry forever! 2. Giordano's. Definitely. 100% More than any other "Chicago" pizza. It takes 45 minutes to get the Chicago Style Cooked, but well worth it. Order right when you walk in, and the pizza should be about ready when you arrive at your table. Amazing. It has biscuit/pie like crust and it is filling. Definitely go there. There is more than 1 Giordano's, so the one south of Magnificent Mile right off of Michigan usually has a much shorter wait than the one close to Water-tower place mall. Or, the Suburbs are much shorter as well. 3. Segway tour around the parks is fun. There are several. Go to the one where they give you a card that doesn't govern the speed as much. 4. Gold Coast Shopping. This is north of the Michigan Avenue strip with the upscale boutique shopping and high end card dealerships like Lamborghini. Walk Rush Street from Delaware north to Bellevue. Rush/Pearson is the Bentley Lamborghini Gold Coast Dealership. 5. Michigan Avenue Shopping. Watertower Place mall is good. There are stores everywhere along the 1 mile Michigan Ave Strip. Apple Store, Nike Store, North Face. 6. China Town. It is less than a 10 minute subway ride. Try the "bubble tea." It is a fresh fruit smoothie with tapioca bubbles in it. Sounds weird, but really good. Fun to shop in China town as well. Also some really good Chinese food. 7. Public Transportation. Get the metro pass. Good for both buses and the metro. Pretty easy to get anywhere. Will save BIG TIME dollars compared to a cab and it will create great memories. 8. Chicago Art Institute. Shed Aquarium. 9. Prime Outlet Malls in Kenosha, WI. It is probably 45 minutes north of Chicago, but an AWESOME outlet mall. Has North Face and pretty much every other major outlet. 10. Going for a jog or walk on Lakeshore Drive is fun. It starts at Navy pier and goes north along Lake Michigan. There are beaches and lots going on. Bonus...make sure you try priceline, 4 star, <$100 for your hotel room. We have stayed at W Lakeshore Drive, Affinia, Omni, and many others for around $100. With Chicago, you can get very specific on the neighborhood you want to stay in. You can go first class for a very reasonable rate!
I have eaten at Joe's a couple of times this year, always for dinner. This past trip in August, I happened to get out of my meeting a little early, and as I strolled by Joe's I just couldn't resist heading inside for some of my favorite food! I had planned on getting one of the any delicious seafood dishes with one of their classic wedge salads, but after seeing another diner completely devour an amazing looking burger, I had to change course. I'm so glad I did...What a burger! Three different kinds of beef ground freshly into a 1/2 LB. burger, cooked medium and seasoned so perfectly as Joe's knows how to do. Fresh toppings, and hand cut fries rounded out what ended up being a perfect lunch.
We came here for my wife's birthday on a Sunday. It was Father's Day, so it was impossible to get a dinner reservation. We opted to sit in the lounge, and very tactfully "stalked" a couple we observed preparing to leave and took their table. (Someone did the same thing to us on our way out, so this is a strategy that we will use again if unable to get a reservation.) The key lime pie is outstanding, and their bloody marys are the best I've had in Chicago so far. I actually would go back there for brunch just to have their bloody marys. The crab cakes were very good but I've honestly had better. The stuffed mushrooms were excellent. We shared the crab claws and enjoyed them, but I didn't taste anything any different than what I would have expected. I might be biased since I grew up in Maryland and ate good crabs several times a year, but I'm just being honest. Overall, it was a nice experience and I would come back. The location is stellar (near Nordstrom and the Conrad), so I could easily see incorporating lunch/dinner here into a great downtown outing with lots of cool stuff to do close by.
The Signature Room 95 or the Signature Lounge 96 is THE place to enjoy the amazing aerial panoramic view of Chicago without the hassle of going through security check-ins and the crowd like that at the Sears Tower. We visited the lounge late at night and we didn't have to wait for a table. However, we did have to wait for a table by the window, which was about roughly 15 mins. The view is amazing especially at night time when the entire Chicago is all lit up. The lounge offers a short list of food snacks, cocktails, wine and non-alcoholic beverages. Though the snacks tend to be on the pricier side, the price is well worth it for the picturesque panoramic view you get. For the ladies out there, you are also privileged to the best view at the Signature Room/Lounge, which is from the ladies room (surprisingly). From there, you are directly facing the Sears Tower and the view is absolutely amazing.
I'd booked a room for my daughter and myself at The Tremont at 100 Chestnut. I knew it was a charming little boutique hotel but had no idea there would also be a fabulous restaurant at the hotel. On our first day there, someone told us that Iron Mike lives in a nearby highrise and visits his restaurant often. We could tell why when we dined there on 4th of July evening. I'm a big fan of the meatloaf at Ted's Montana Grill, so I had to try out the meatloaf at Ditka's. It was so astonishing looking that people at other tables gasped and then they ordered it too. It arrives as a large stack with a polenta-like cornbread on the bottom, two slice of meatloaf on top of that, with a Ditka BBQ sauce, then herbed mashed potatoes on top of that, and thin sliced onions at the penultimate ... with drizzled red sauce and green onion sprinkles. It taste fabulous. Move over Ted's. So, huge that I could only eat a little over half. I had to save room for the Creme Brulee'. If a restaurant serves Creme Brulee', I always evaluate it. This one was quite good. But maybe not as good as the Meatloaf stack. The wait staff was extremely good. When my daughter could not decide between a Caramel Apple Martini and a Chocolate Martini, the waiter came back after a discussion with the bar staff and asked her if she would like to have a combination of the two. The resulting product was awesome. The night we dined there a group of mom, dad, and little baseball players were at a big table that seated maybe 8 people. Everyone in the group seemed very happy with the food and the sports themed memorabilia.
I came here with no expectations - it was my boyfriend's choice as he is a bear's fan. The service was great, it was a quiet night and our waiter, Jeff, chatted to us about all sorts - really friendly, knowledgable and helpful. He even sorted me out a complimentary Mountain Dew as I had never tasted it before! Be warned - go here hungry - the portions are HUGE! To start we shared a tuna and avocado roll - it was sushi style - and gorgeous. Try it! I had BBQ Salmon as a main and my boyfriend had the restaurant's signature dish - Pork chop, served with cherry sauce and sweet potato mash. The pork chop was the biggest I have ever seen and it was cooked to perfection. The sweety potato mash and cherry sauce went perfectly. The salmon came with a sweetcorn relish - which was lovely and some sort of corn cake - which I wasn't keen on, but it didn't matter because the salmon steak was so big! After a long rest we shared a banana cream pie which did not dissapoint! I couldn't move after the meal! It is a great place for a celebration or family meal. Prices start off at about $11 for a 'Fridge' Burger and range up to about $50 for a 30oz steak! There is all sorts of interesting sporting memorabilia on the walls to look at and you can even buy a 'Steak Sauce' to take home!
This place is great, the only restaurant I have been to that has coat check and to-go orders. It's atmosphere is classy meets athletics. Cigars, sports memrabelia and excellent food. The servers are very attentive although the place has been packed every time we have been. Try the pot roast nachos as an appetizer. They are a perfect combination of savory meat and spice. The pork chop is the star of the menu, big and bold. Ditka's cannot be missed if you are in Chicago.
The food is consistently good. My friend had a burger with the chopped salad for lunch and I had the lake perch with a chopped salad. The salad is, I think, the best in town. The burgers are always done to perfection and the lake perch was very lightly breaded and fried, absolutely delicious. We ate in the bar, it is kind of noisy, but a fun atmosphere. For those who want white table cloths, the dining room would be a better choice.
We ate here and it was the bomb!! Our server was extraordinary and knew the menu inside out!! he was friendly and super helpful... I was with friends and people who had been before, I ordered something not on the menu The tom mo hawk.... it was $65 but worth every bite YUM!!
Ditka's Restaurant is a higher end sports restaurant/bar. Polished woodwork and very tasteful sports displays of interest to all, on two floors. Lots of interesting rooms, a bar section and a restaurant. Great food and impeccable service. We felt welcome and at home. Attached to our hotel, we visited more that twice during our stay. Particularly likeable is their Sunday brunch.
While on a short vacation to Chicago, took my wife, our oldest daughter (college aged) and my wife's parents to Ditka's. We were glad that we made reservations, because there was a long line for those without--but we were seated right away. It was a Friday night, and both football and baseball was on the many televisions, which really ramped up the volume of the place, so I wouldn't consider it for a romantic dinner, or if a lot of business needed to be discussed. Our server was Kyle, who has worked there for almost two years, and I'd ask for him again if I went back. The food was terrific all around, with very large servings. I had the double pork chop (delicious), my FiL had the ribs (looked like two slabs), my wife had a steak, daughter had the half-chicken, and MiL had the fish and chips. Nobody had room for dessert, and we were still full when it came to breakfast the next day. Lots of sports memorabilia on the walls throughout the place.
One of my favorite things to do is go here and sit at the bar order the "Fridge" burger, have a bloody Mary that comes with a side of iron Mike's beer and watch a Bear Game. Perfect slice of Chicago.
Went to a private dinner there in the upstairs dining room. Appetizers were tasty and interesting, wait staff worked hard and kept a watchful eye, my steak melted in my mouth and then.....Da Coach showed up and greated our group. How could you not be happy with all this?
We tried Joe's a second time while visiting Chicago. We first tried it last year and it was so delicious, we put it on our "Must try again" list. It will stay on that list. We started with the stuffed mushrooms and the Mortgage sampler for 1 - both excellent. My husband is not a seafood fan, so he ordered the rib eye steak, which he claimed to be outstanding. I had the Joe's scallops and our son had the turkey burger, both of which were delicious. We ended the evening sharing the coconut pie and peanut butter pie. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening, will absolutely return when visiting Chicago next, and heartily recommend Joe's to any and all.
We were in Chicag visiting our son at Uof Chicago. We asked him what he wanted for dinner and he said "Steak!" We were staying in the Tremont and thought we might try Ditka's. It was very good. The place was packed. We made a 7:00 reservation and got there about 6:30 and they couldn't seat us until a bit after 7:00. There was a convention in town and the bars (Ditka's has 2) were packed. But, when we got seated, our waiter was fantastic. The food was very well prepared. Steaks were perfect. Portions were huge. It is pricey, but what good steak place isn't?
During our recent 10 day get-away, we tried several places ie: Shula's, Bin 35, Frontera,Harry Carey's. The food & ambiance at Ditkas was very nice. Although high priced, we found the portions to be Ditka size. We throughly enjoyed the pork chops & spitzel?, the steaks & sorbet. Service was excellent.
We took the family to Mike Ditka's Restaurant on a saturday night. I was a little concerned about the prices, but figured what the heck, when's the next time we'll be in chicago? I'm glad we went. It is right up my alley. It is the perfect blend of classey, dark wood, low light cigar bar and sports bar. Obviously there was a lot of Mike Ditka and Chicago Bear memorabilia. We sat in the booths across from the bar and had views of the games on the TVs. Our waitress was everything you want in a waitress...courtious, helpful, patient, and not hard to look at. As far as food, let me start with the kid menu. Everything on it is around $6. My son got the 2 mini cheeseburgers and my daughter got the chicken strips. Both came with a generous portion of fries. My son gave his the ultimate compliment: the burgers were so good he didn't need ketchup. The chicken strips were hand breaded and great. I had the rib platter, it looked like something out of the Flintstones: a giant rack of bbq rids and a mountain of fries. The ribs were tender enough that you could pull the meat off with a fork. But if you did want to eat with your hands, they brought out 2 hot towels with lemon to clean up. The wife had the Medallions 3 ways. She raved about them, siad it was nice to get a steak cooked right the first time (rare). The steaks get a little pricey and they don't come with any sides, which makes them more expensive to eat if you want to go that way. They also had a pretty good selection of draft and bottle beers. We really didn't look over the wine list, but I expect it was above average. We didn't get to see the upstairs, maybe next time. Although I really enjoyed the bar area where we were seated. Wife and son were hoping to meet Mike Ditka, but it was the night before the Super Bowl and I told them in advance that there is a .1% chance of him being there. One last thing, the location is about a block off of Michigan Ave, not far from the Water Tower.
Although this place is a little expensive it's quality of food and service is indeed worth it. The New York Strip was one of if not the best I have ever had. The service was great and friendly. A very nice staff, The four of us were to be seated upstairs but since i use a cane they seated us downstairs. very nice.
We travel to Chicago a couple of times a year and one of our favorite places is Ditka's. We enjoy the service and every meal is great. An excellent wine list as well. Dining can be quiet in the dining room or eclectic in the bar area. Went in for St. Paddy's Day and though we went just before closing, we got the last two servings of corned beef and cabbage. A perfect ending to an Irish Day.
Attended in June with three adults and three kids (11, 9, and 5). Our 11 year old does not always get enough to eat when ordering from kids menus. Not a problem here. Grilled cheese and fries is adult sized. Kids burger (two slider sized with fries) and chicken fingers were also good sized and tasty. I ordered light (soup & salad) so I could finish my five year olds tasty chicken fingers and fries. Service was great. Waiter noticed my wife was given regular fries when she ordered Truffle fries. He brought a large replacement order without us ever commenting on it leaving the regular fries as a bonus. Adult bleu cheese burger was good and so was the soup & salad. I have eaten here several times previously and have never had a bad meal or poor service.
I was excited to take my newlywed hubby there, as Chicago is his hometown, he is a football coach (and sports freak in general) in Puerto Rico where we live and da' Bears are his all-time team and I wanted to surprise him. We took the train there, so we walked-in and didn't need parking therefore we didn't even pay attention to that aspect, but we were hungry and happy not to have to wait in line to be assisted. The friendly hostess sat us down immediately in a comfortably-sized booth near the bar downstairs. We could hear music coming from another, more informal bar upstairs, but it was wonderful because we could enjoy it and still be able to talk to each other and the staff. With no delay at all, our water glasses were filled and re-filled everytime one of the waiters passed by (we were thirsty from the walk, so very grateful). We got our menus right away, made a decision quickly (I had read about their "Fridge" burger) and it seemed that within 10 minutes, we had our plates, hot and perfect in front of us. The burgers were cooked to order and were very tasty. The waiters (one for food, one for beverages) were very attentive, friendly, respectful, well spoken, squeaky clean and ironed uniforms. They never let us (or our sodas and water glasses) out of their sights but still stood far enough from us that we could talk uninterrupted, enjoy the music and the memorabilia and art on the walls. After dinner, we walked around the restaurant looking at all their memorabilia collection and bought a "Da' Coach" t-shirt in Chicago Bears colors at their little gift shop. It seemed that they have at least four or five different spaces to choose from, depending on the mood or occasion: the actual bar, the booths near the bar, the bar upstairs (with bar-type taller tables and chairs) with live music, regular dinner tables upstairs at the opposite end of the live-music bar and a large room downstairs for previously-reserved groups, meetings and other events. I had imagined about twice as much memorabilia, but I was still pleased browse the many pictures, etc. They say Mike Ditka actually shows up every once in a while, but we weren't that lucky this time. We'll be back!
We spent the Friday and Saturday in Chicago before we went to Indy for the Super Bowl and we decided on Friday night we should start at Ditka's. We were very happy we did. Everyone in the restaurant was very friendly. We had a short wait at bar before we were seated. We did not have reservation and we were seated on a Friday night in less than 20 minutes. I had the chopped salad and the ribs. Both were great. The ribs had a little kick to them but I liked that so it made me enjoy them even more. The portions were very big. I usally an able to finish anything put on my plate but I was not able to finish the ribs. We enjoyed the restaurant so much that we decided to return on Saturday night. On Saturday I had Da Pork Chops and they were also great. My friends had different steaks and everyone enjoyed their meals. We also loved all the sports pictures that are hanging throughout the restaurant. Ditkas was a great start to a super weekend.
Had a very nice meal there. It was our first night out in Chicago, and we'd gone there on the hotel concierge's recommendation. The waiter was very warm and friendly. I had no idea how expensive steaks are in Chicago, so I had the hamburger and my daughters had one portion of fish and chips between the two of them (they are 11 and 13). Their portion was so big they had leftovers. I now wish I'd bitten the bullet and tried a Chicago steak not because the burger wasn't good, but because I didn't try what the Midwest is famous for. I can't say our food was remarkable, but I'm afraid I found eating out in Chicago to be disappointing in general. I would return to Mike DItka's though if I had a bigger budget.
Had Da Chop. Hands down the best pork chop I ever had. The cherry sauce and apple chutney really set it off. Filet mignon was also very good. Banana creme pie ended a great meal. The only down side was the noise level. We were put an an alcove area with some other loud groups and it held the sound in. It was hard for my wife and I to carry a conversation. To the benefit of the restaurant. One of the groups did apologize for being loud. The other areas in the restaurant may not have this 'acoustic issue'
We have been to both the original Joes in Miami as well as what has now become one of the best places in Chicago. There is a reason that this is call Joes Seafood PRIME STEAK & Stone Crab The steaks are some of the best in Chicago...which is the superbowl of Steak! We had the bone in filet that was aged perfectly. We also had one of the finest service experiences ever. Friendly, fast , knowledgeable...and gave us a personal guided tour of the menu. I believe his name was Oz...and he was a food wizard! Save room for dessert...the pies may bring tears to your eyes!
Was in town for business & I think there were close to 30 of us that went out for a group dinner. We had a private room upstairs & walked through what I think was an ESPN radio show broadcasting live upstairs. Was decorated with lots of sports motif memorabilia, most of it of course featuring "da coach". For appetizers, all our tables shared an appetizer tower that included coconut shrimp, & liitle lamb chops. For my main, I had the bone in filet mignon ($49), my neighbour had the tuna (he said it was awesome) & I saw more than a couple bone in rib eyes happening. All you get is your piece of meat, so our server insisted that we order several sides (think we each chose 1) which we all passed around & shared. Meat was good (& quite alarge cut), sides were good, all in all quite good. For desert I ordered the chocolate cake & it was massive too, easily enough to share with 4, & we shared it amongst 8 I think. It's a kinda celebrity vanity type of place, I'm told Ditka is there quiite often, & he did make a point of coming into our room after our dinner & thanking us for coming in which was nice. A bunch of people in our group took his picture, he wasn't exactly kissing babies, but he did stay for a minute or two before leaving us.
We ordered five of the small-plate offerings: Charred cauliflower with cornichons was tart and luscious; prosciutto bread balls were bathed in a tasty, lively sauce; grilled scallops were large and succulent; pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - the ultimate comfort food. And then we had an order of some kind of cured meat, which turned out to be a few nickel-sized slivers, no bread, no crackers, hardly a mouthful. Why bother? On balance, I'd recommend the place but beg the management to make the menu more user-friendly by explaining the dishes a little more clearly. Although our server cheerfully answered our numerous questions, it really would have helped us compose our meal better and more quickly if we just could have read it up front: (i.e. -- what's the "tartufo," what's a "spiedini," what's "a la plancha," etc. etc.) Nice lunch, anyway.
This restaurant was so fun! We tried so many small plates and they were all delicious. The waitstaff was friendly and efficient. The wine was amazing. We sat outside; the heaters were on which made it pleasant. The inside seemed like it could be loud.
We went on recommendations from friends to Purple Pig on New Years Eve and had a blast! The wine was wonderful and the food incredible. My friend is a vegetarian so don't be frightened off by the name. While there is a lot of pork on the menu there are many other options as well. The wait staff was extremely knowledgeable about the food and the wine. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. They have a small plates menu that is extremely resonably priced. We ate way too much but you don't have to. You could just go and have a small plate and a glass of wine. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Chicago. And it's right on Michigan Ave. so the location is very convenient.
Since it isn't that easy to find a nice hang-out on Magnificent Mile, which is not a rooftop bar and where you can sit outside without being blared by music I was happy to find 'The Purple Pig'. I have to admit that it is hard to get a table without a longer wait time but the wait is worth it. The menu offers decent European wines; most of them for less than $40 a bottle and tasty tapas/small plates you can share with your companions. But the most important thing is that you can spend hours talking and have an enjoyable evening with friends without being interrupted by noise. If you cannot decide on the menu try the milk braised pork with mashed potatoes, the spreads, and the artichoke, potatoes and asiago cheese appetizer. The restaurant's inside also looked promising but I guess it will be noisy. + nice patio to have drinks with friends, + delicious small plates to share, + good European wine selection, - long waiting time Average price for a plate: $10 Average price for a bottle of wine: $35
After hearing from a few locals and the concierge of our hotel about how wonderful this restaurant is, we had to give it a try and WAO!! Is the only thing that can describe it! Most dishes are meant to be shared so please come very hungry because you don't want to stop. We had the Whipped Feta with Cucumbers to start along with the Roasted Bone Marrow with herbs... amazing! Who would have thought bone marrow could be so good. Then my husband ordered the Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes... It melts in your mouth! I ordered the Prosciutto Crusted Cobia with Clams & Sea Beans and I don't think I have ever had better fish than that. Of course, after all this deliciousness... there was no room for dessert! Bummer. Definitely, coming back and highly recommended! Do not leave Chicago without going to this place. Now, be ready because they do not accept reservations and the wait time is usually over an hour.... But you'll be glad you waited!
A group of us tried this place this week based on trip advisor. We couldn't book a table and so we sent in an advance party to reserve a table for 8, we arrived about 20 mins later and in total we waited over an hour for the table, but they kept us adequately supplied with the drinks. AND BOY was it worth the wait, we sat outside under the heaters and were looked after by Ryan, we told him we would go with his recommendations and he just kept the dishes coming, every dish different, every dish hitting the spot. The food flavours were fantastic. My only downer is I think they pack too many people in and getting people to wait around means they are hanging around the diner's personal space a bit too close. Nevertheless, great experience.
If you can handle some noise and a "no reservations" policy, this place offers a unique culinary adventure. The menu is full of unusual offerings, and everything we tried was delicious. The foie gras preparation was light and delicious -- the best I have ever had. Fried pigs ear was served on a bed of crispy kale. The pig's ear was OK -- but the kale was GREAT! Tapas-style portions allow you to try lots of fun new preparations. We spent about $150 for 2 people -- with plenty of excellent wine.
I had read about the Purple Pig, but when I went there last week, the food far, far exceeded my expectations. The quality of the ingredients, combined with truly unusual combinations, created one of my best meals in the last few years (and I travel and eat at a large number of restaurants each year). I loved it so much that I went back two nights later to try some other items and found them to be equally outstanding.
The catchy name stuck with me after reading several favourable reviews so when we happened to pass by on a rainy Saturday afternoon, we jumped at the chance to give it a try. We were not disappointed. From the moment we moved into a tentlike patio area, we felt welcomed. We were able to get a table for two but would have happly sat at one of the long community ones. Even though the place was bustling, our server took the time to explain the menu and helped us choose a wine by letting us taste it first. They also served water in lovely old fashioned bottles which they refilled regularly. It's the type of place where you chat with people at neighbouring tables and so many of them were local, repeat customers. We watched as each dish was brought out - they were served one or two at a time, sort of like tapas, family style. We ordered 5 plates and were not disappointed in the least. We had a couple of antipasto dishes - a bowl of braised baby artichokes, fingerling potatoes, asiago and salami and the calamari plate . Both were delicious but I wish we had a bit of bread to wipe our plates clean! Next we had a caslefrank, sunchoke and hazelnut salad with a tasty apple vinaigrette - ditto about the bread. I did ask but none appeared. That was okay because I really didn't need the extra carbs. Next we enjoyed an order of Jimmy's house sausage and some fried sardines. We finished off with a perfected prepared machiatto.
We LOVE Joe's! We go whenever we are in Las Vegas, and knew that we would also go while we visited Chicago. Our first day in Chicago we walked in to see if we could get a supper reservation for that night. They were booked solid until 3 nights later... a reservation is a MUST!! the food is a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. the atmosphere is wonderful, and the service is absolutely FANTASTIC!! We each had Fillet and Crab legs which were delicious! the Peanut Butter pie is an absolute must! We will definitely eat here again!
Based on the reviews, we decided to try this place. We were not disappointed. All the dishes we had were excellent. Some I may not do again (bone marrow was intriguing but not something I need to do again!) but I am glad I tried it because it was good. Other dishes I loved-the beets with goat cheese and the scallops! Our waiter was awesome. He knew when to offer advise, when to show up and when to go away. The place was busy as rush hour, but he acted like we were his only customer. We sat at a communal table. This was a lot of fun. We met some great people doing so! It is a loud place though, so conversation is difficult!
After the airlines stranded us at the airport for 10 hours we decided to rent a car for a quick trip into the city. Once we got to the miracle mile we spotted the Purple Pig. We decided to be adventurous and we were well rewarded. I have never seen most of the items on a menu and we took a leap of faith. After tasting the selections we were rewarded with some of the best food ever. The staff was helpful in recommendations and it made the delay in Chicago not that bad.
Amazing but expect a 2 hour wait. The food was deadly, in a good way for your taste buds but not for your heart. The place had a nice comfortable relaxed but busy, unpretentious atmosphere. The waiter was helpful with some wine pairing. I had the octopus which was perfectly done skewered so it cooked evenly, not rubbery at all the perfect texture never had better. Than I had the homemade headcheese and a nice aged piave, than the bone marrow smear with homemade bread. While I was eating this the waiter had thought I ordered a JLT jowl lettuce and tomato sandwich with a perfectly cooked egg on top, how could I refuse, I was deciding weather to get it but had not ordered it when you see that beautiful specimen of a sandwich how can you resist. So after eating pretty well through all of my gastronomic symphony I decided to blend a couple of heavenly morsels together. First the toasted homemade bread than then marrow smear, next the headcheese, than onto the pork jowl, and lastly the heart attack before I even took a bite, like those people that die before they hit the ground. (No real heart attack but you can definitely feel the palpitations). The richest mouthful of food I think I ever had. What a meal the top of my list in Chicago. Adios amigos!
We had read positive reviews on Trip Advisor before leaving home, so we decided to give the Purple Pig a try. We arrived at the restaurant (conveniently located on 500 block of Mag Mile) just before 5:00 on a Friday afternoon and it was already packed! A quick 15 minute wait and we were seated at a long table on the covered patio next to other families/couples. This really contributed to our enjoyment of the meal, as we were able to see other diner's selections and share a little chit-chat with friendly strangers. It felt almost European. The plates are small which is perfect for trying many items. Our kids were very good about trying different selections, but probably the chorizo sausage was their favourite. The chicken thighs on a skewer were melt-in-your-mouth good, as was the caesar salad and beets with goat cheese. The service was quick which was amazing considering how busy they were, and the clientele seemed to be a mix of young urban downtown workers and families. Probably lots of parents feel frustrated that the only options for children on menus involve hamburgers or chicken nuggets with french fries. I know we were glad to see our kids enjoying some vegetables! We would definitely eat here, again.
It was recently on the cover of Chicago magazine as one of the city's best new restaurants. We had to check it out. They do not take reservations so go at an "off" hour if you don't want to wait. We arrived at 5 on a Saturday and were seated immediately, but ten minutes later people were lining up. It's right on Michigan north of the bridge. It's theme is "cheese, wine and swine" and it delivers on all counts. The wine list is good. We asked if we didn't finish our bottle of wine could we cork it and our server readily agreed. Turns out, it was an unnecessary request! Beer is also available. Hubby and I could not decide so the server suggested we start with a couple of the plates and then order more when ready. it was a good plan. We had a lovely fresh tasting asparagus salad and a nice olive plate. Later we had the roasted pork shoulder and mashed potatoes that everyone raves about--deservedly so! i forget the other dishes but everything was very good. Fun lively atmosphere. In the center are big communal tables, Service was excellent throughout. Big thumbs up!
We visited this restaurant twice at lunchtime during our week in Chicago and it was great. Deliciously cooked fresh food, fascinating combinations of unusual ingredients, good service, good wines, central location, pleasant atmosphere, and above all highly recommended for any Europeans who find themselves struggling in vain to munch their way through the vast portions served up at the normal American restaurant The Purple Pig is ideal for a tasty lunch that leaves your revived and fit for an energetic session of afternoon sightseeing. Recommend the sardines with fennel and the bread pudding.
It seems like the owners of this restaurant can't decide what they want it to be: the cutesy name and the horrifically loud pop music says it wants to be a hip, downtown meeting place where people don't really have to talk to each other; the fabulous mezze-portioned, Mediterranean-inspired dishes and interesting, thorough, and accessible wine list says this could be a super place for couples, group of friends, or anyone who appreciates great food and wine to meet, eat, and drink. Unfortunately, these same people will find it hard to TALK to each other without shouting across the table. This is a wondeful restaurant--but PLEASE turn the volume down!
Loved this restaurant!! The wine and food were fantastic. We stopped by on a very busy Saturday afternoon and managed to snag a couple of seats at the bar - super friendly bar staff - generous pours of great wine and a couple of truly delicious dishes later - we left very happy! So happy in fact that we made a point to go the next day when it wasn't so busy, but we still sat at the bar - where you can see the chef preparing your food right in front of you. Very generous portions of delicious, imaginative food - I could eat there every week and not get bored in a year.
We sat outside since it was a lovely day. The food comes in smaller amounts and is meant to be shared. We tried some different meats, cheese, and salads. The nice thing about this type of restaurant is you control the amount of food you want because you don't order all the food at once. You start with a few items and if you are still hungry you can order a few more items. The service was quick.
Along with a few glasses of wine, DH and I had the pork-fried almonds, pork neck bone rillette, 3 cheeses (podda, caveman blue, and a 3rd I can't recall), followed by the lemon panna cotta with our coffees. Although we did not order it, we were introduced to the uber-trendy burrata pugliese, so if you're looking to try that, this may be the place. Lunchtime was a comfortable level of crowd and noise, and a feeling of good fun permeated the place. The food was good and the menu a refreshing change from the usual. In particular, charcuterie and French food lovers will enjoy. This is DH's favourite in Chicago.
We were in Chicago from England for a long planned visit and keen to visit some of the steak houses and other American restaurants we had read about as we have nothing like this in England or Europe. During our ten day stay we ate in three steak houses. All were excellent but without a shadow of a doubt Joe's was the stand out -- in fact the best meal we have ever eaten, notably the fillet mignon -- and having travelled round Europe, Asia and large parts of the USA for us that is some accolade. We'd rate the three steak houses we ate in as follows: Food 1. Joe's Steak House 2. Ruth Chris's Steak House 3. Gibson's Atmosphere 1. Gibson's 2. Joe's Steak House 3. Ruth Chris's Steak House We shared a portion of Stone Crab for starters, followed with fillet mignon and ended with apple pie and ice cream. The fillet mignon was extremely tender and succulent, melt in the mouth and came on the bone, something you don't see in England served with amazing hashed potatoes. We didn't know what they were but found them so delicious I'd be as big as a house if I lived in Chicago. And who knew that a pedestrian dish such as apple pie could be so tasty and mouth watering. Knocks the French version, Tarte au tatin out of the ball park. Service was knowledgeable and efficient. Nothing cutting edge about the decor -- it was the wooden clubby sort we saw in all the steak houses we ate in which we don't mind. We were lucky to get a booth which made the experience more enjoyable. All in all a sublime culinary experience. We also ate in Carmines (Italian), Pizzeria Uno, Mercadito (Mexican). We also had a Guy Fieri Diners, Drive Ins and Dives evening and went to Portillos (hot dogs), Big and Little (Southern Food -- everything was fried and we hated that ), and Kumas, reputedly the best burgers in Chicago. Tip: We found it very hard to get a reservation as we were in town for Mother's Day and a major convention and didn't want to eat in the bar area where's there's endless hub bub so suggest you book in advance of your trip, especially for the weekends. It wasn't as bad as the Frontera Grill who laughed at us when we rang for a reservation while in Chicago and told us we need to book at least two to three months ahead. Who knew Chicago had its very own French Laundry!
What really stood out was the service. The restaurant and bar were full and we had to stand in the aisle a bit - but even there the service was attentive with a drink menu brought to us immediately and an effort made to seat us as soon as a place opened up at the bar. From our entry to the very end, every single employee there added positively to our experience. We also had the good fortune to be seated at the rear of the bar right next to the food prep area. It was quite a show and the preparers were more than willing to answer a myriad of questions about everything they were creating. Though sitting at the communal tables or the other end of the bar would have been convivial as well, this spot made our night. A fun restaurant with a swine theme. "Cheese, Swine, and Wine" Lots of creative tasty choices served tapas style so you can try a bunch for a reasonable price. Every dish we had was perfect: Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg (ears were fried like onion rings and the kale literally melted in your mouth), Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana (one word, yum); Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese Schmear (a meal in itself); and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes (also melted in your mouth). Nothing here was ordinary and there were lots of opportunities to try things outside of your comfort zone. At the same time nothing was so outlandish as to be offensive. Each dish was a perfectly tasty combination. Overall would say this place is a must and is in my top ten favorite restaurant experiences.
Went to Shaw's during a spring break Chicago weekend with family. Reservation was for 8:30 and we were seated by 8:50, the place was EXTREMELY busy on a Friday night. The bar was 3 deep, but the servers are expert, and we got drinks, stood by, and watched the traffic fly by. We were seated and immediately attended by our waitress, and she was perfection in advice and service the entire night. Water servers, stewards and the like are all very quick to refill, and after ordering the oyster sampler (YUM) and full size lobster tails and other goodies, we were eating as fast as we could want. The waitress checked on us often, and the food was dynamite! If you want intimate quiet dining, go elsewhere, this is a large place with a raucous Chicago crowd and GREAT food! We will be going back for the oyster bar lunch counter experience.
I had a great meal at Shaw's. I know from the reviews that the bar side is the livelier but I was seated in the dining room. The bar side did look like it was a bit more energetic, but it was also completely packed. I liked having somewhere to set my glass. Though I enjoyed everything I ordered the oysters really stole the show. Their champagne mignionette is amazing. And the oysters were fresh and delicious. For teh entree I ordered a smapler with shrimp, scallops and a crab cake. They were all delicious. I am not sure how to describe the sauce that came with the crab cake but it highlighted the dish wonderfully without gettign in the way of the real star - the crab. For the beer lovers out there you should also know that Shaw's is one of the very (very) few places I have been that has Stiegl on tap. This is a great beer from Austria that is difficult to find but well worth it. Show up 30 minutes early and have a Stiegl at the bar before dinner.
Recommended by local Chicago friends and did not disappoint! AMAZING seafood, but even more impressive is the knowledge of the staff about seafood. We had the blue crab legs, oysters on the half shell, swordfish, salmon. We have two sons ages 9 and 12 and they ordered off the adult menu. Kids menu and mostly fried foods and regular kid menu items. I would have liked to see a small salmon or fish item on the kids menu. Regardless, we all had great seafood here! We were going to go to Joe's Crabshack the next night and our local Chicago contact told us after going to Shaw's we would be disappointed in Joe's! LOVED the seafood options and staff knowledge!
Eat in the main dining room. Old School seafood perfection. Room is dark paneled wood. Service is always spot on. Love the scallops and the crab cakes. The oyster bar on the casual side is nice, festive, lively; however, we prefer the dining room. Noise is at a minimum, menu is slightly different and service is better.
We made a dinner reservation for Shaw's our first night in town and I'm so glad we did. It was excellent! My husband had the perch which he enjoyed very much and I had the surf & surf which was a lobster tail and crab legs. The lobster had a little too much pepper flavor for me and seemed a little chewy but the crab legs made up for it. It was our most expensive meal in Chicago but you definitely get what you pay for. All of our other meals didn't even come close to this one!
I had a combo platter that seemed to be way over priced...$49.95 for large crab cake, grilled shrimp, scallops and some rice. Could get same at Red Lobster for about half the price. My friend had King Crab Legs. She said they were the best she's ever eaten, and she gets out often.
I went with a friend on a Sunday night and we had a ball! Lovely helpful staff, great menu (you can choose to sit in bar area or across the other side in the tonier restaurant). Fantastic band playing some wonderful jazz, and the seafood - scallops and mahi mahi - was wonderfully cooked and presented. This is just a great venue. Pity we have nothing similar in the UK!
This was our first visit to Shaw's and certainly won't be our last, now that our daughter and husband live in Chicago. The menu is mouth-watering. We both ordered the lobster thermidour and it was delicious. Our waiter was Dick J., a 20 year employee with a truly engaging personality, and detailed knowledge of the menu choices. The service was impeccable,and drinks ice cold. The place is pricey, but well worth the expense. Please call the day before you want to eat there to get a good time. as it is very popular. We booked our reservation before noon, through Open Table, and only 5:45pm and 8pm were available so we chose the 5:45 seating. By the time we left, the lobby was filled with diners waiting for their tables. You will not be disappointed dining at Shaw's.
One might think that Shaw's is a tourist trap, but it really isn't! The food was fresh and delicious and the service was excellent. They have a few different options for seating, depending on your preferences. You can choose a diner style setting, a white table cloth setting or fine-dining like setting but in the bar area. We found the diner section a little loud and the dining room was empty, so we sat just outside the main dining room near the bar. It was the prefect compromise! We had both the hot and cold appetizer platters and both were delicious. A nice mix of seafoods and very well prepared. For our main we split the haddock special of the day (it was a Tuesday) and it was also delicious. We had a free tuna maki (thanks to the Yelp app) and it was also very tasty! They gave us a free piece of chocolate cake since we were first time visitors, what a nice touch! It was one of the best pieces of chocolate cake I've had a in a while, very most and creamy. Our server was very attentive and really aimed to please. I would definitely go back.
We eat at the mothership in Miami regularly and are big fans of the Chicago branch. The iconic stone crabs, mustard sauce and key lime pie are all there and, bonus, unlike Miami's endless waits, Joe's Chicago takes reservations. We've always found the service is always excellent and intuitive.
This was our third visit to Shaw's Crab House in Chicago. The first time we ate at Shaw's was on a whim because it was within reasonable walking distance from our hotel. After eating there that first time and having great seafood and excellent service, we have continued to go back to Shaw's whenever we are in Chicago. Each and every time we have eaten at Shaw's the restaurant has been packed. Table space is really premium real estate as the tables are very close together. The menu is fairly expansive with a number of fresh fish, seafood dishes and even sushi. One side of the restaurant is an oyster bar which we have not tried. The entrees we have ordered have been very generous portions. The side dishes were large enough to feed three people, so go hungry if you order multiple side dishes. The waitstaff is extremely attentive and we have been well taken care of each time we have visited.
We went to Shaw's for the house specials and were well impressed by the quality and generous sweet and juicy portions, served with no unnecessary extras - just lemon and liquid butter. South African Lobster tail was shelled and perfectly cooked, a light and tender texture. The red king crab was the highlight of our trip to date. We've eaten plenty of good tasty crab before but this set a new standard. The legs were half cracked already making it all too easy to extract the clean, fresh and sweet flesh inside. That's all we ate, it surprised us how filling it was. The service from front of house and our waiter was very friendly, professional and refreshingly honest about where we should focus our attention to experience the best Shaw's has to offer. Great beer matching with a Goose Island Sophie. The place was packed and had a real buzz in the atmosphere, decor a grand old style. A true fine dining experience. Highly recommended. $140 plus tip & tax.
Smiling hostesses offering great service, our waiter was energetic, very accommodating and EXTREMELY knowledgable about the menu. He even gave us other recommendations on where we could hang out and lounge in the surrounding area. The food and wine was great. I will go here again when I am in Chicago.
I visited Shaw's twice on a recent visit to Chicago in May. It was absolutley fantastic on both occasions and I can't recommend it enough. On both visits I ate in the 'Oyster Bar' which is on the right as you enter the restarant. I did not get a chance to eat in the main restaurant, which looked quite smart but had seriously big queues waiting to get in, even at 7.30 pm. The Oyster Bar is basically an old fashioned bar with a few tables in it, the atmosphere is relaxed but busy and the waiting staff are attentive but not overly so. The bar offers an extensive range of seafood, no surprise there then! But the staff will be able to tell you what is in season etc. I had the home made crab cakes, very tasty, and on the second visit I had fresh, steamed lobster, which cost around $35.00 for a one and half pound lobster, which was excellent. The bar also offers a good range of beers and spirits, the local Goose Island Honkers is very good. There is no dress code for the bar, I don't know about the main restaurant. My top tip is...get there early (6.30'ish) if you want a seat, the place was packed by 7.30 and I don't know if you can book or not. The fact that the place is so popular with the locals speaks for itself, you won't be dissapointed.
Quite simply one of the best meals I have ever had. Being from an area with a lot of good restaurants, I am not that easily impressed with many out of town restaurants. This one is just great. It has granduer and elegance without being stuffy or pretentious. The food is amazing. My wife and I had the crabmeat cocktail, shrimp cocktail, and some interesting sushi rolls to start. I had a surf & turf and she had a clam chowder. All were perfect. Eating here, you would think you were on the ocean in Maine or Cape Cod with how fresh the seafood and fish are. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone. What a great experience.
As I have just found out that I have a multitude of food allergies with gluten, dairy and weirdly rice topping the list, it was nice to go to a restaurant where the gluten free menu did not consist solely of salads and bland meat dishes. The GF menu isn't huge but definitely bigger than most, and I was excited to have a substantial amount of options to choose from. Although pricey, the Maine lobster dish I had was tasty, a good portion size, and accompanied with flavorful seasonal vegetables. We chose to the sit in the bar area for the more low key dining experience but the service was just as good as if we had been eating off of a white table cloth. The waiter was extremely attentive and our food was placed in front us 20 minutes after ordering with at least two checks-ups while we were dining. The only sub-par piece of the meal was the Greens salad which I would replace with another GF vegetable dish. Over-all my experience at Shaw's was extremely pleasant and I am already looking forward to trying the crab on my next visit!
We ordered three-course crab dinner for two, and it was a lot of really good food. My wife had clam chowder, and said it was awesome. However, I can't imagine it was as good as my lobster bisque. It was the best soup I have ever had. For the main course, we had three different kinds of crab (dungess, Alaskan, and crab cakes). The crab cakes were okay, but the other crabs were incredibly meeting and outstandingly tasty. We also were served au gratin potatoes, creamed spinach, and cole slaw. All were fine and dandy, but let's face it: it's really not what you go there for. Our entree came with a dessert. We both chose the recommended key lime pie. It was good and it was large. My wife drank a triple berry mojito and liked it. While pricey, the food was worth it, but not really a bargain, just really good. The service was good, especially the bus boy. I do like it, though, when the server asks how the meal is within a couple minutes. That didn't happen, but nothing was wrong anyway.
As we flew out to the US on my husbands birthday, we didn't really get to celebrate on the actual day. I thought it'd be nice to go out to somewhere fab in Chicago and celebrate when we got there. I had a good poke around www.tripadvisor.com and decided on Shaw's Crab House, as we had both tried Alaskan King Crab in Florida a few years ago, and we loved it. Alaskan King Crab is Shaw's speciality - yum! I booked online via their website, which throws you straight away to www.opentable.com, and shows you what's available and you book through them. You get the chance to make a note on the booking, and I said that it was for hubby's birthday, so that they knew it was a bit special. We lobbed in there about 15 minutes early and discovered that a booking basically essential. If you don't book, you get your name taken and given a beeper with at least an hour to wait. Half of the restaurant had been booked for a private function for the Ryder Cup - it's pretty popular! We were shown to our table by the friendly staff and then our waiter introduced himself and took our drinks orders, taking our food orders when he came back with the drinks. I started with the Maryland Style Crab Cake with Mustard Mayonnaise and it was gorgeous and not huge, just a perfect size. For main I had a pound of Alaskan King Crab Legs which arrived with a claw cracker and a bib, so I could look extra classy whilst I shovelled it in. And shovel it I did, it was so yummy. Their wine list is good and varied, we chose a bottle of Two Hands red from South Australia. I know, I know, "Red wine with seafood, are they mad?", but you'll just have to trust me when I say it was just right. Our lovely waiter then appeared with a wodge of chocolate cake with Happy Birthday written on the plate in chocolate and a sparkler stuck in the top - how lovely! Whilst chocolate cake is good at any time, I'd heard great things about their Key Lime Pie and we asked for the chocolate cake to be boxed up and to try the Pie, hubby's favourite, which was glorious. All in all, it was a great restaurant with friendly staff, bustling atmosphere and well worth the money - perfect for a celebration.
We ate in the oyster bar area as the restaurant was full. We were seated up on high stools at a table for two which was touching a table for 4 people. I dont know if its a nationality thing but this is something I think most British people find a little uncomfortable. We couldnt have a conversation without our neighbours hearing every word and vice versa for them. We had only decided tos top here on the spur of the moment and werent massively hungry so we decided to just order the crab cake sliders and burger sliders to share. My husband had a beer and I ordered a bloody mary which was huge and delicious. Our neighbours finished thier meal and left and were quickly replaced by another group of 4. Whereas earlier it was really just a lack of personal space which caused a little discomfort it was now really made uncomfortable by our new neighbours. They talked in very loud voices and were pretty scathing of the UK and its eating habits, in particular Scotland where apparently EVERYONE deep fries EVERYTHING. apparently. When our food was brought to us we received glances from our neighbours and they made no attempt to hide thier disgust at the fact "they're in a seafood restaurant and ordered sliders!?" what we ordered was entirely our decision and none of their business. Now I know people will say the place should be judged on its food, drinks and service but when squeezing in as many tables as possible in order to maximise turnover of customers is more important than customers being comfortable and being able to eat and talk and relax with a little privacy then I have to say it all contributes to the experience. If you dont mind being practiaclly sat on your neighbouring tables knees, having to listen to thier conversation and they yours, whether you like it or not, then do go here. The food , service and rinks were all really good. But badly let down by the seating arrangements, we actually got so sick of the people next to us that halfway through our food we decided to get it to take out and took it back to our hotel to eat. We arent unsociable and indeed with the people who were sat next to us first we had a few polite exchanges about menu choice and the size of the bloody mary but the proximity of the tables meant when our new neighbours were seated we were made to feel really uncomfortable by their comments and behaviour, all of which wouldnt have happened if there was a bit of space between tables.
Celebrated our wedding anniversary at Shaw's on a recent Saturday evening while visiting Chicago. The service was excellent as was our meal. Our server made several outstanding recommendations for both food and wine. The seafood was as good as I've had on either the East or West Coast. They did a great job of making our anniversary dinner a special event which isn't easy to do in a large busy restuarant!
We arrived at lunchtime with no reservation. I initially suggested to my friend that we eat in the bar area so we would get a quicker service but I'm gald we waited 15mins to get into the restaurant. The restaurant had a lovely decor. Our waiter was efficient, friendly and very knowledgable about the food. The crab cake was the best I have ever tasted, I would go there again for that alone! The rest of our food (Mahi Mahi and the Seafood Platter) was fresh and nice. It was a bit pricey but if you want nice meal in a relaxed atmosphere it's well worth it.
I used to go to Shaw's Crab House/Blue Crab Lounge every Friday after work. Then my twin sister became the pastry chef at Shaw's and I would drop her off every morning after swim practice and have the breakfast of champions...a slice of Shaw's Key Lime pie (mouth watering) and a cup of coffee! Unfortunately, I no longer live in Chicago, but when I visit the city, Shaw's is a must!
We lined up at 4:15 on a Sat.; we were seated in the main dining area by 5:20! The service was fantastic. We had appetizers, entrees, dessert and drinks. For four of us, $190; very reasonable. The food was amazing! Well worth a visit!
I've read many of Rick Bayless' cookbooks, and watched him on TV several times, so I've been wanting to come to his restaurant for awhile. It's hard for me to judge this place, as I grew up in the Southwest used to a certain type of Mexican food. Bayless tries to feature the many aspects of Mexican cuisine, and his use of roasted chilies and limes are very noticeable in the food. The food at Frontera Grill is refined and the flavors are very deep. Some of the ingredients tasted like they were fresh out of the garden. It is obvious that the restaurant cares about the quality of ingredients it puts on its menu. That being said, it is very different, and in some aspects less comforting than the spicy stews and braised pork enchiladas I grew up with in New Mexico. I never thought I would leave a Mexican meal feeling like I ate "light."
Yes, it's a little pricey for "Mexican food," but don't expect your typcal Taco Bell tacos! Authentic Mexican food with earthy spices and fresh salsas. And Master Chef Rick Bayless was in the house the night of our visit! My husband and I treated my son and his partner to dinner at Frontera to celebrate a new job. We started with an assortment of appetizers, including a wonderfully tasty ceviche, tender-crisp taquitos, empanadas, and freshly-made guacamole. Then we each chose different entrees and shared tastes of each. All of our dishes were superb. Things to be aware of: The doors for dinner open at 5:20, not before, even if it's raining as it was the night we visited. Nonetheless, get there early. They don't take reservations for Frontera, and people start lining up an hour in advance.
Excellent meal with my wife here, excellent clilles rellenos- best we've had, with well done rice and beans, 24 is more than typical but this is not typical food. Guacamole dip was small portion size and high in price- 9.75. House margaritas were served in a martini glass- so small in size- and 11. Ate in the bar, pleasant and active atmosphere. Overall very good, just be prepared to expect more quality and flavor and more cost than typical tex-mex.
We visited this restaurant with our 8 month old son on a Friday evening for an early dinner. They were very accomodating and helped us get seated almost right away. The atmosphere is very warm, with bright colors & wonderful art everywhere. Our meals were better than we expected. I recommend the Empanadas--they tasted fabulous! The avocados were the freshed I've ever eaten at a restaurant. This is a place you could bring the whole family, but I'd also recommend it for a date night too. We'll definately visit again the next time we visit Chicago, with or without the kids.
We husband and I (somewhat apprehensively) took our two young sons to Frontera recently for lunch, and we had a terrific experience. The place was a bit boisterous and loud, so our kids' fit right in! And the food was incredible, as usual (my husband and I knew how good it was; at least it was when we had gone there years before, before we had kids). Our sons devoured the guacamole, and there was a good kids' menu. And when one of our sons tipped over his water glass (of course), the staff was quick with towels and extra napkins, and didn't seem the least bit put off. We felt so comfortable there we even stayed for dessert (a wonderful pecan pie split between my husband and me, and the ice cream sandwich for our sons).
My husband and I just had a great dinner at Topolobampo. This is not a taco and fajitas place, but a nice restaurant to have real Mexican food. We had one of the tasting menus, and the size, quality, presentation and variety of it was really good. The service is very good as well, Whitney was very helpful and attentive. We will definitely come back to this place.
We had a wonderful meal at Topolobampo. Reservations are essential (I made them 2 or 3 weeks in advance). We were seated promptly and our waiter was friendly and charming. His explanations were sometimes excessively long (for example, I asked about a particular species of fish on the menu, and was rewarded with a 10 minute dissertation on a variety of subjects, including that fish and 5 or 6 other menu items I hadn't asked about and wasn't interested in). The service was otherwise perfection itself. The menu items bear no resemblance to the typical Tex-Mex restaurant menu, and you can see the current menu on the restaurant's website. Everything was fresh, meticulously presented, and the blends of flavors worked well. I ordered to Chef's tasting menu; the portion sizes were a little larger than typical tasting portions, and they were organized to present flavors of increasing richness and complexity.
I dined at Frontera on a Saturday night around 10:45. The service was outstanding and did not rush us even though it was close to closing time. The waiter picked up quickly that my friend was a vegetarian and pointed him to the veg friendly items on the menu. I enjoyed my fish tacos and my friend had the portobello mushroom tacos. The guacamole was outstanding, as were the grilled veggies and peppers. The catfish could have been better seasoned, but was fine. We drank Goose Island Marisol on draft which was an excellent complement to the food. I try not to pay too close attention to hype, but this place has always been recommended and it did meet my expectations.
This weekend on a road trip to Chicago I took my mom to Joe's for Birthday/Mom's Day treat, after reading the great reviews on this site. Good choice! Though we called too late for reservations on a hopping Friday night, we found two cozy seats at the bar and enjoyed amazing cocktails while waiting (not long!) for our dinners. The steaks were perfectly done, fork tender, and my mom's lobster also was perfectly grilled. We also had broccolini and asparagus sides, also done to a turn. We enjoyed every bite but couldn't finish our portions so had the leftovers boxed. Only trouble was, when we arrived home we discovered that my mom's partial portion of filet and lobster was missing - a culinary tragedy! I called up and explained the problem to the evening manager, who very kindly arranged for us to pick up a replacement before leaving town the next day. I called the next day to confirm and the daytime manager was just as wonderful. We picked up the replacement, beautifully packaged, and they even included a to-go bread basket! We went to Joe's for the food, but we'll return for that, plus the over-the-top wonderful service. Thanks to managers Sean and Eric and their wonderful staff!
We enjoyed our 5 Prix fix menu tasting. While I would not order some of what came up, I really enjoyed trying things outside my scope. Rick Bayless was sitting next to us, sampling his own menu, which I thought was cool. I felt the service was a bit slow (there for 2.5 hours), I imagine they don't want to sacrifice quality for speed so I sort of understand. It is very expensive, but worth it once in awhile! Margarita's are great!
Excellent meal. Very busy on a Wednesday night, we had to sit outside, where it was mega hot, but worth it. Mojitos were fresh, guacamole was perfection, and the meats that were served with the tacos we ordered were divine. Various types of tamales were enjoyed thoroughly-- sweet corn, shrimp, and more. Very happy.
Spent 4 days in Chicago and took my wife there based on her love of Spanish/Trendy restaurants she likes. We live in Southern CA and of course many Mexican/Spanish/Nuevo restaurants there, but this restaurant hit a home run with her. She ordered the Duck with Apricot Mole and she was in heaven. I ordered the Carne Asada Brava which was this large thick flank steak in an incredible red sauce and just the right spice with black beans,guacamole and plantains. The wait is long, but try the bar because we got a spot for three, including my son who felt like a big boy(he's 12) and were in and out in just over an hour. The drinks are especially good and the bartenders are good at giving suggestions on dinner. Out of 4 days this was our favorite restaurant in town.
Went on a Thursday and enjoyed signature margarita along with the lamb mole - wow! It was pretty special in terms of flavor and I really enjoyed it. Don't know that I would call it Mexican. Rather Mexican inspired fine dining. It is loud and crowded and the service is crisp. The waiter suggested my order and I was not dissappointed!
Okay, so going into this dining experience the bar was already ridiculously high. James Beard Awards, tv shows, cookbooks, etc... Well let me tell you, there is a reason for the hype. This dinner blew me away. The homemade guacamole was the best we'd ever had. The Jicama/Cucumber/Pineapple salad was incredible. My wife ordered a roasted chicken dish with beet sauce while I had grilled shrimp with crispy kale, green herbed rice, and a pepper medley. For dessert we ordered the raspberry-apple turnover with sour cream ice cream, topped with pink peppercorns. The entire meal was simply outstanding.
We were told that the wait was 90 minutes. After 20, I went in and inquired, and we (2) were seated in the (noisy, busy) bar 10 minutes later. Despite the hubbub, the waiter was attentive, the appetizer great, and the entrees terrific. By the time we finished dinner, the bar scene had calmed down a bit, and we lingered over a Hot Chocolate with Mezcal. This place is justly famous - the menu is mouthwatering just to read, and we left very happy.
The DH and I visited Topolobampo in December and loved it. Yes, the food and drinks are on the expensive side, but I think it's well worth the visit for those special occassions. As far as Frontera Grill, we just visited this past weekend and only have positive things to say about it as well. We didn't make a reservation, but got there early enough, or at least I thought, and had to wait an hour and a half to be seated. On the plus side, and if you enjoy beer/wine/cocktails, they have an awesome bar. We had a great time while waiting to be seated - ordered margaritas and the guacamole appetizer. Now, one thing to note about their drinks, they are so tasty, but itty bitty. The drink prices start around $10, not worth how small they are. As far as what we ordered once seated, we chose the steak tacos and mole chicken enchiladas - so good and on the inexpensive side compared to the rest of the menu. Overall, we had a great time and will likely return to Frontera Grill before Topolobampo.
I had the pleasure of lunching at Frontera on Friday 6-8-12. My sister, her boyfriend and myself were prepared to wait the 45 minutes for a table but as we were waiting for drinks from the bar 3 people just happened to be leaving. Score! We started with the salsa and chips, guacamole and the queso fundido with shortribs. The queso was phenomenal! My sister's boyfriend damn near licked the crock clean-it's that good. For lunch I had the Frontera Classic Trio, my sister had catfish tacos and her boyfriend had the Frontera Street Trio. All three of us cleaned oour plates! It is a little bit spendy but soooo worth it. You can check out the menu on the restaurants website to get acclimated to the prices and the offerings. Don't miss out on this place it's worth every penny!
Topolobampo is an excellent Mexican restaurant with flavorful food and excellent margaritas. This trip was our second time at Topolobampo and it did not disappoint. The summer margarita made with cucumbers was mixed to perfection. The watermelon mojito was a very refreshing drink as well for a mojito lover. We started with ceviche, which is one of their specialties. I had a scallop and crab meat ceviche, which was bursting in flavor. The problem with most ceviches are that they either have too much citrus, or not enough. The ceviche was made perfectly. For my main course, I had lobster made with two types of garlic. It was fantastic. The lobster was moist and came out of the shell easily. The best is when I took a piece of lobster and swirled it around in the garlic sauce. Very flavorful. It also came with some barley that had some of the garlic sauce. Very flavorful as well. For dessert, we had a pistachio cake with pistachio nuts on the side and creme fraiche. This was fantastic. It did not last on the plate long. The service was also really good. Attentive, but they did not hound over your shoulder. They gave you enough time to eat each course. Topolobampo is next door to Frontera Grill and they share the same entrance. Frontera Grill is the more casual of the two restaurants. One would expect the noise to filter into the Topolobampo side, but it was really not that loud. For a restaurant of this caliber, the portion sizes are fairly big. Come on an empty stomach. Rick Bayless will not disappoint.
We were so looking forward to this meal and it exceeded our expectations. We could not get a reservation at Topolo or Frontera so we lined up on Friday night at 4:50 before they opened at 5. The line moved really fast once they opened and when we got to the front they said it would be about an hour, come back to check in 40 minutes. We were starving so we went around the corner to Xoco and ordered a takeout sandwich to share. While we were waiting we saw chef Bayless in the open kitchen tasting all the dishes - what a thrill! We walked around the neighbourhood and ate our {amazing} torta, then went back to Frontera Grill and got our pager and had a drink at the bar. The coconut mojito was delicious and so was the margarita. Once we were seated the service was incredible. We mentioned an allergy and the server was very knowledgeable, then a manager came right over to check on us as well. We had the cheviche trio and duck carnitas in masa boats. These were some of the best things we've ever tasted! I wasn't as crazy about my main - pork in a creamy bacon sauce, but my husband's tacos al carbon were great. We had more cocktails with the meal and coffee afterwards and the bill was only $150 for the two of us, including tax & tip. More than 50% of that was drinks. The food is very reasonably priced. I would love to return!
