The reviews of this camera are correct. It is an excellent SLR. High megapixel produces great images and usual canon controls. For landscape photography it really does the job. Video is clear, would like to see better out focus and can be grainy at high ISO. Recommend staying at lower ISO, but I have been able to take amazing night sky shot. Really love 6D and cost just right
Great sensor with high ISO. Purchased two years ago. Full-frame camera at a terrific price point. The high ISO and HD video capabilities make this a terrific purchase at a $1,600 price point. Sensor/ISO quality is much better than 5D Mark II--compared via indoor videography.
This camera is simply amazing. It's small and light weight. It's also very easy to learn the new features (compared to my last Canon body). There's nothing wrong about it. It takes stunning pics. The best part is the built-in wifi feature. The camera gets on its wifi and from my iPhone, I can see the pics and instantly post my shot. Love this camera. Can't recommend it enough!!!!
Amazing camera body, combined with EF 24-105/F4.0 L zoom. An excellent combo. Has very high resolution, excellent color quality and extremely versatile. Still experimenting and learning its huge range of features. Excellent FX sensor camera at a reasonably low price.
Favorite camera in my bag with it's light but strong body, full frame sensor, and high resolution. For the price, can't be beat. I do love the 5d Mk III but, again, for the money, can't be beat and sometimes the features on the 5d almost seem overkill for every day and wedding shooting.
Been shooting it for four months. I love the low light capabilities. I opted for this over the 5D M3. I am satisfied. No stars off because of the position of the AF button. My hands are big and with my hand strap I am always accidentally pushing it.
WOW, a year later and I'm still finding new stuff... only complaint is the wireless feature, doesn't seem to have a very good range when using my phone and remote apps. Otherwise this camera is awesome! Very happy!
Very high end, full-frame professional camera. The 2014 canon rebate made the price right. Lots of research went into this purchase and this is where I landed for a full-frame camera!
I need to have always in my house these marker. I use them to write my lists,and they look awesome!Just get a frame,change the default pic with a nice pattern background and you have a cool board.
I ordered these because I got a great deal and half regretted it until I tried them out. Did I need them? No.. but they're beautiful! They glide over surfaces. I tried them out on windows and the color is bright and happy. They wipe off with a little pressure. I'm confident I'll get a lot of use out of these!
These are great. They work on any non porous surface, but I've only used them on glass so far. They're perfect for writing on the bathroom mirror and windows. The colors are vibrant, a lot brighter than I had expected. And they come with this cute holder. The ink washes off easily too. I love these markers!I recieved these at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review.
Theses are really amazing. I hadn't really thought of using these before but after getting them you realize how many things you can use them on. We mostly use them on car and house windows (our own of course) to have fun like drawing a face on our back car window or flowers on our house windows. These do come off easily when you need them too and they don't have any smell.
These markets work great on chalk board or black foam boards. Love the silicone case that comes with them!!
It takes a couple of minutes to get the marker ready to write for the first time. The color look great and tip of marker stays saturated with ink. The paint is dry after few seconds. A lot better than the average dry marker. I would not recommend for small children however.
My daughter LOVED these ans uses them every day! They are so bright on her chalk board. I would lutchase these agian and agian. I recieved this product at a discount for my review.
I was given a discount in exchange for an honest review. These chalk markers work great! Gorgeous colors, perfect for decorating my husband's car for our anniversary. (*evil laugh*) Highly recommended! The holder is super handy, too.
These are great markers! There is no smell like those permant markers! The colors are so bright and cool! I can think of a lot of applications from the glass to labeling things in my pantry! Will get s lot of uses out of them, thank you for a great product!
Wonderful marker set for advertising using our storefront glass. Its a business must have. It does take about one minute or so of priming the market before its ready for use.
Just got these markers! Love them! Very cool! These are perfect for use in my classroom. Very easy to use, with bright colors.
Very bright, smooth flow. As an amateur crafter I am delighted with these chalk markers ---- small to large chalk board displays are one of my hobbies and these ones with their super bright colors add the special touch needed to impress.
We homeschool and these are the first chalkboard markers I have ever used. I love how smooth they write. This is a seriously great buy. I don't know how I got along without them.
I received these today and could not wait to try them. They do not leak nor do they run and they come out clean and even. I have chalk bubbles up the wall by my front door to remind me of appointments and such, and with these bright colors I feel more secure knowing that I will notice my important dates as they stand boldly out.
Good book..I enjoyed the story and the subplots. Good character development and story lines. I highly recommend the whole series.
I found this book delightful. It is quite entertaining and has an original look at dominant and submissive relationships. What happens when a charming, handsome dominant falls hard for a girl who is not a natural submissive but is a total sexual innocent. Can they make it work? Can they learn to love and trust each other. Will they need to make compromises and can they?
All everyone talks about is all the kinky sex that goes on, but really.. There's so much more to this book. I read Fifty Shades Of Grey in less than two weeks. Completely and absolutely hooked from the very first chapter. It's like a television series that ends each episode with something crazy and you just have to see what's gonna happen next! Ahh love it love it !
I actually seen the movie first and decided I wanted to read the book to compare note. The book was well written I thought, and would recommend it to all the curious ladies out there.
 actually love this series..... I get into it... sexually hahaha but you need a read. And you want something different. Go ahead and try. Instead of judging.
Best enduring, soul searching, gut reaching, heartless finds true love- story ever written. I will read these books until I'm 100.. Timeless classics
It came nicely packaged. I used it after I washed my daughters hair with a dab of conditioner. Really soft and shiny. I used on my hair as well, then flat ironed it the next day. We have really curly hair and it gets real dry. My hair came out shiny too without being greasy. I use on my dry hands and cuticles too. It's non greasy and doesn't have any smell to. Can't wait to cook with it.
Awesome product. I use it on my dry hands and my daughter's hair. It says external use only. But the label also says it can be used for cooking. consuming this would then become internal, which is confusing to me. for this reason I plan to only use it as described above (External use) as a safety precaution.
I use coconut oil all the time, but had never tried fractionated coconut oil before. This was to my surprise better and easier to use than the solid.
"If you have curly hair, I recommend you buying this product! I saw an almost instant improvement with my hair which is curly, colored, and damaged from straightening. It was sent to me & received in exchange for my honest review."
I love this for mixed with my essential oils. Also i like so much, the follow up the company provide and service. I receive a discount on this product as exchange of my honest review. And im truly love all this products!
I absolutely LOVE this coconut oil! So far I've used it to help my daughter's cradle cap, clear up her diaper rash, and as a moisturizer on my legs. You don't have to use much so you really get your money's worth with the 16oz. I'll definitely make sure to keep this stocked in my house because of its versatility!
Excellent product. Very easy to use. So far I have used it for a skin moisturizer and after a shower in my hair for a light conditioner. I have a mild case of psoriasis and this is very soothing, non irritating. Non oily/greasy. I would purchase again.
This is a good sized bottle for the price. The smell is good. I was very surprised at all the different things you can use this for. I do believe this is the healthiest my hair has been in a long time. You only have to use very little and that works very effectively. I highly recommend. I WILL be buying it again. Love it.
Radha does it once again with excellent quality with their Coconut Oil! This oil is great for many skin conditions and can be used as carrier oil as well for massage oils. I use it as a moisturizer and it works very well, with a quick drying time and no staining. At this price and amount that comes in the decently-sized bottle, you are getting a good value too :)
Totally love it, is odorless like it says it doesn't dry out and works wonders, use it to give a well deserved massage to my husband and he loved it... I highly recommend this product
All the great voices we have gotten use to for years. love it and now happy to say I have the whole Justice League Series. Hurray!
had to been one of the best cartoon show around - great use of all the DC star - yes batman does steal the show - but love the use of all the other hero
Even without knowing anything about DC Comics, you can jump right into action with all the adventures included in all the episodes. My kids and I love it!!!!!!!!!!I bought it out of the correct order, but I like it!!!!!The correct order to watch is:1. Justice League - Season One2. Justice League - Season Two3. Justice League Unlimited - Season One4. Justice League Unlimited - Season Two
Love this set. Discs are well secured and fit in the box tightly to keep them safe and scratch free. Incredible special features/commentary tracks. Highly recommend for any collector.
I love this episode! Downloaded for the kiddos because its their fave too and they watched it 6 times in the car on the way home. Well worth the $!!
I love this show because it shows how even superheroes make mistake and own up to them. Even they aren't perfect. I also like how this show has actual plots and characters you care about. Marvel seems to be in it for the money, but DC Comics seems to care about the relation between the viewer and the characters on the show; making sure you can connect to some of the characters in a personal way.
I LOVE this series! Best animated series ever IMO. But ... Where are the Blu-Ray discs for both JLU's two seasons? The two JL seasons are out in Blu-Ray already. I want to buy these NOW but I really want the Blu-Ray treatment for them. Guess I'll have to wait a while. Drats!!
IS A GREAT REPRODUCTION, THE EXACT NUMBER OF EPISODES AND ALL COMPLETE. SO FAR NO COMPLAIN. I LOVE JUSTICE LEAGUE! XD
this is the show that really solidified the durability of the DCAU in the wake of BtAS and SuperBat Adventures, before Batman Beyond. while the predilection for two-part episodes got annoying later on, this is still eminently satisfying to rewatch.
Justice League: So much imagination. I so enjoy cartoons. I so enjoy Justice League. Voice actors, thought that goes into the clever writing, just the total imagination and everything that goes into making these awesome shows. Thank you.
I love the theme song so having it appear all the time did not bother me. I loved seeing other characters from the DC world. Each episode usually focused on one villain or hero. I loved it. I wish Shayera would wear her mask though :)
ordered these for my 47 year old boyfriend and he loves them, he almost watched them all already and will be ordering more
What can you say about these Justice League Animated shows. Hard to find on television, so pick them up now while you can. Great show. Don't go over $20, but try to get for $15 even if its used.
I used to catch bits and pieces of this on TV back when I was in high school and only recently remembered about it. Pretty pleased with Amazon for making this one available, it's successfully resparked the inner comic book nerd in me.
Great collection of the justice league unlimited episodes. Great stories, great animation, very happy with this collection. Will buy the next one soon.
This is exactly the television we were looking for. No complaints at all. Highly recommended if all you need is a simple, thin, light, and non-smart TV that has excellent picture and sound. We mounted this on our wall right away with ease and have been enjoying it ever since.
I'd seriously give this product 6 stars if I could. I'm thoughoughly impressed with this TV. I have two Samsung 6000, 7000 series and this matches their quality, possibly even better. The picture is crystal clear and sound is great. My best buy on Amazon to date!
HD pic definitely great. For the price you really can't go wrong. The legs have to be installed (which I found great as I was putting on wall anyway) and it is pretty light. Overall great value thus far
Rarely write reviews, however this tv is worth writing about. Clear sound, perfect picture. Audio could be better but it's really good. Besides you can adjust the audio to how you want it which I did and now it's perfect. No complaints here. This tv is amazing and I'm glad I got it.
Great vacuum. I have a dog, and this thing sucks up all of the dog hair with ease. It has a long enough cord that I can vacuum the majority of my apartment without unplugging & replugging in every room. I like how the brush-roll is auto-adjust -- no need to stoop down and convert the brush roller from "low carpet" to "high carpet." Emptying the canister is also a breeze.
It's lightweight and has a lot of power. I didn't realize how much dust accumulated in my carpets. The canister is large and holds a lot of dirt and the attachments make it easy to clean any area. I love it!
loving this vacuum. needed something strong to pick up dog hair but I hated my Dyson--too heavy with not enough control. Everyone I surveyed said "Shark" and I chose this one that Amazon had a great price for. Very happy so far. Strong suction, with a release to handle small area rugs, lightweight feel with great easy turning.
This vacuum is awesome! It picks up everything, it's fast, and the cord has a decent length to it. It wasn't even difficult to put together. I'm so happy I spent the money for this vacuum, as it was TOTALLY worth the price!
Oh my goodness; what an excellent mqchine! I was a little sceptical until I read a review by another person who's situation is similar to ours; lots of pet hair! My rugs look brand new; no exaggeration. I have psoriatic arthritis and this is easy to push, maneuver around & lightweight.
Absolutely LOVE this machine! I purchased it based on the reviews I read....and everyone said exactly what this machine did! I was shocked at how much it picked up and sadly embarrassed because of the other machines I've purchased which did absolutely nothing :( I pray this baby will last forever.....MUST HAVE!
This vacuum has tremendous suction - as a matter of fact, the attachments and hose have a "bleeder" port so as not to pull the paint off the walls. Works well, picks up pet hair well, is lightweight and easy to maneuver. Watch out Dyson....As to longevity, I will amend review if needed.
I purchased the Shark Navigator Deluxe to replace our old vacuum. It is a lot smaller than our old one, but works GREAT! We've only been using it for a couple of weeks so far. The suction is impressive, and it practically pulls itself along! As of now, I'm very happy with it. We will see after using it for a longer period of time.
Had the Shark Navigator and loved it. Lasted longer than any vacumn I'd ever owned. Got the Navigator Deluxe and am one happy camper again. It's just as great with the added bonus of being self-propelled and a larger dust cup. Way to go go Shark!
It had no suction at first so I assumed it was broke, but the next day it was working just fine! I owned a shark navigator, but my dig ate the chord, so I used my hose on this deluxe vacuum because it did not come with a hose and some minor things, such as the handle screws. My point is, I am going to use my navigator to supply the parts for my deluxe. Other than that, it works like brand new!
A lot better then Bose headphones and cost $300 less . They are very comfortable(sometimes I forget I am wearing them) and the sound is so crisp and clean. The first time I bought them was back in 2005. after 5 years of wearing them they broke and but I am buying a another pair.
Called the company, excellent customer service. I put it in a 1978 3/4 ton full size Chevy truck and did not have to modify anything. This thing works like a champ.

Awesome brake controller with many options. Installed on a 2003 f250. Easy to install works great. Tow an open 16 landscape trailer. 14' enclosed and a 20' enclosed loaded with lawnmowers. Handles all no problem. Easy to switch trailer modes with the boost button once set. It's great!! Looks great in truck too.
This controller is great. I installed it and the setup was easy. I had a short one day at the trailer and the controller automatically sent a trouble warning. I was impressed. I would buy this controller again. Great product.
I got this controller in 2011 and it has been fantastic. The acuity of the control is second to none. I recently had an issue and it was resolved under warranty with no problem or stress. I've hauled 18 and 40 foot trailers and the ability to adjust the voltage is a must have feature.
Great brake control! Let's you know if things are connected as they should be. Much more advanced than my prior control. They all should be made like this. Has been very durable over the years
Easy to operate and easy to see when making adjustments to the braking force. You will not go wrong with this EBC!
Worked well. I wish all cars with a toeing package had a built in controller, until then, this was easy to install and use.
Perfect replacement for an old Tekonsha unit. Very easy install in our 2004 Expedition using the Tekonsha 3035-P Brake Control Wiring Adapter also purchased on amazon. Mounting bracket and holes were identical to the old unit. Easy set-up for our new Double D horse trailer. The all-electronic (vs mechanical pendulum in the old Tekonsha) of this controller gives us smooth stops.
Unit works great. Only have 2 complaints1. The installation instructions are not detailed.2. There isnt any way to turn it off. However it does go to sleep but really wish I could turn it off.that being said there may of been a whole book of instructions that wasn't in there.
After installing it in our truck, the trailer shop we worked with is starting to carry them because they liked how it operated, installed and looked. I couldn't be happier and feel so much more secure with our 28' snowmobile trailer when its loaded and the roads are questionable.
This brake controller is absolutely transparent in operation. I press the brake, my truck and trailer stops quickly with zero drama. 74 Scout II, 1969 14" Timberline LoLander. Brand new Dexter 3500# axle.
Tekonsha makes a REALLY good brake controller. Have used this now between two different trailers and it adjusted so easily between the two different sizes and weights. Love the inertia sensing and auto adjustments. There are cheaper units available of course, but after using this I wouldn't ever consider going to them.
This is a night and day difference between my old controller. It is so smooth with my 35 FT trailer. The best purchase I have made for towing my monster of a trailer.
First time needing a brake controller, went with this one because of the reviews. Very happy with decision, easy to hook up. Very easy to set up once trailer is hooked up.
Comfortable, easy to read and the night light is an added benefit! Only problem I have is the stem is a little difficult to pull out to set time or date other than that it's the perfect watch for me!
I have always owned a Timex watch...actually my Timex sopped keeping time after several years of constant everyday wear..so I was so happy that Amazon offered 2 day free delivery as I am a person that cannot live without my watch..for the price you cannot beat a Timex watch. Love it and thank you Amazon for such prompt delivery.
Purchased this for my 93 year old mother this Christmas. She totally loved it! Especially since she can light up the dial to see it even better. Would recommend it as I had already purchased one for myself and liked it for the same reasons.
always buy Timex as they're durable, have an easy-read face, second hand, and the light-up dial. Strap is ample. Equal quality to past watches. I've gotten compliments on this style.
The watch is basic but it is perfect if you only need it to be accurate in telling time and the current date. I've had several of these in the past and they've all worked well.
It is a bit plain looking but has the night glow I needed and easy to read numbers. The band is not quite the nice thicker rawhide of earlier times but works just fine. It also fits my rather large wrist. And I have always trusted Timex.
Was heartbroken when I lost a similar style Timex as it was my favorite and kept excellent time. Am equally happy with this purchase which is identical to the old one except it has the addition date feature. As always, Amazon provided a great price and fast shipping.
Nice watch with good styling and comfort and not too bulky or large on the wrist but a clear and easily readable face. And the indigo nightlight is a nice feature...particularly when the season makes the days shorter and more consistently dark than not.
Very practical. Such a great watch! Really worth the price because it's water proof, it has an elegant design yet simple, and it features "indiglo" which comes in handy at night. I received it the next day which was super fast!
This is a nice basic everyday watch. The numbers are easy to read and I love having the Indiglo light for at night when I wake up and wonder what time it is.Timex is a trusted brand and it was delivered quickly.
I love this watch! I have small wrists and I didn't have to make any additional holes to fit. I love that it lights up at night when I want to see the time. Awesome watch!
Best watch ever. My wife and me have been using this watch for many years. Easy to read, and the best "night watch" with the Indiglo feature.
This is at least the 3rd purchase I have made-I love this watch-only problem ever is the leather wears out after a while, but I buy straps for it and am good for awhile!
I have been buying and replacing with this same style watch for years. Very convenient. with the help of the glo light I can read the watch at any time or condition of day. I really depend on it. Now I have one in spare.
It's a great watch! So far, the date function has been working fine and the light feature is also nice when checking the time late at night (a lot better than blinding myself with my cell phone).The band and watch face are small and it looks pretty / feminine, but can fit a variety of wrist sizes.
It's a Timex, pretty much indestructible! The dial is definitely easy to read as advertised and my aging mom really appreciates the Indiglo dial light feature.
This is my second indiglo watch. I lost the first one in my house and bought another one just like it. That's how much I think of this watch.
My dad purchased this for my 84 year old mother. She had been looking for something simple with an easy read dial. My father suggested searching for good old Timex and we found this. Great price and my mom loves it. She has very small wrists and this adjusted down to her size which many watches don't.
I bought this toaster a few months ago and it worked great right from the start. At first I was concerned because I thought the elements were not all working. Boy was I wrong! I used the factory setting of 4 and it put the perfect golden brown toast evenly on the bread. I have used it many times and the toast comes out perfectly every time. I highly recommend this toaster!
We received the toaster right on time -- Prime shipping is fantastic!! The toaster is great. We have had several toasters and have been disappointed because of uneven toasting. This Cuisinart toasts evenly. This is the best one we have had since our old Sunbeam automatic gave up.
We are very pleased with it. We have been through 4 toasters in the last 3 years, and this Cuisinart works far better than of the other ones. It toasts all four slices evenly, and we love the 2-ding bell when the toast is done. The default timer is 4, but we like our toast a bit darker, so we use the 5 setting.
This is my second indiglo watch. I lost the first one in my house and bought another one just like it. That's how much I think of this watch.
I bought this device so I could record the audio output of some of my devices (like my Wii U) directly to my computer for recording purposes, since my mic jacks don't work. (I basically have the audio cables merged to a 3.5mm jack, and the 3.5mm jack plugged into this device, which is plugged into my computer). I wasn't expecting phenomenal audio quality out of it, but after disabling the 'ACG' setting and switching to DVD quality in the recording settings, the audio quality is surprisingly good
Bought it for the wife out of self defense for my ipad. It is very very nice, a very clear screen and seems to be just perfect for us.We bought it from E_Trade&Tech LLC (NO TAX) - Amazon Marketplace, and it came very quickly, very well packaged. A pleasure buying from them.
This is one AWESOME little radio! The reception is amazing! It is so handy to take with you. I do a lot of walking and this little radio will be going with me. Love it!! Would highly recommend it. :)
My Microphone input was broken On my laptop but I was able to use this instead and use my headset, works perfectly
Need a DVD. This is a cheap way to use for your CD and DVD disks. The CD audio is sweet. The DVD video is great watching movies and home DVD's. Low price and awesome use. Get one and be happy.
Bought 3 now... and will buy more as gifts. This is so simple to use, inexpensive to buy and just plain works great
I bought this Roku a while back. It works great! I love it so much I don't know what I would do without it. It's only happened one or twice but, sometimes the remote will un sync itself. Very quick fix though, there is a small button you press and Wha-La it syncs back up and everything is fine.
Works great. The mac has a nice feature if you're using a usb headset that allows you to hold down the option button and click the volume in the upper right, you can select what output to use. It's a great way to switch from headset without unplugging them
A very fine Chrome Book, and I'm extremely satisfied with it. The large -- 13 1/2 inch -- screen is clear and well-lit, keyboard easy to use, and it definitely has answered all my needs and wishes for all that a Chrome Book has to offer. I would highly recommend it.
works perfectly. includes hdmi and 30-pin connectors so you stay charged when connected to the HDMI source, e.g., a TV. Be warned: I had ordered a cheap not Apple adapter and it failed to connect my iPad.
This is a great product... I needed two sound cards on my PC for some recording I was doing and this device fit that need perfectly. This device was completely plug and play on my Windows 7 system. I couldn't ask for more at this price.
cool camera...shipped and delivered super fast. Love this new toy. Wish mounts and such, were cheaper, but its a cool camera...you should get 5.
I really like all the cool features. I purchased two of them when they were offering them for $199.00 ea. This a super bargain for a phone like this. Both the wife and I like them. Add to the deal 2 Yrs. of Amazon Prime, how can you go wrong. Thanks Amazon
This battery ($29) is much less expensive than the price quoted to me at a large electronics store for a replacement battery ($79) for my HP Laptop. I've had this replacement battery in my HP Laptop for about a year now and have had no issues. My Laptop is not my main work computer however, it is mainly used for leisure so I cannot say for those that extensively use their Laptop that it will work as well as the original. However, I have no complaints and would certainly purchase again if needed in a few years.
We had a total failure of the original batter in the laptop and this one fits and holds a good charge. The price was very good compared to others we had looked at. Nice to not get that warning about battery when we boot it up.
For those who are concerned about their gaming system in tight places with little ventilation and the system heats up, I use this for my Playstation 3 system. Sits right under it and plugs right into the USB port. BUT WAIT. You think it'll take up a spot in the port? WRONG. On the back of the plug is an extra USB port so you can plug this in then your PS3 charger USB cable. SOUND? Well honestly it is silent but with a big PS3 Slim on it, you can hear it slightly. Overall I would buy it still it's the perfect size.
So far, I have used this several times, and I am quite pleased with it.I only do wish that it had a small display showing "play," "stop" etc and elapsed time though, since in my opinion it would be a convenient feature. I also appreciate the fact the remote also controls the television since it's also a Sony. The movies I have played in it thus far, all are a truly excellent picture quality. My only complaint is the annoying buzzing sound at higher sound volumes, though I do not know where or not its caused by the DVD player, or the TV itself. Certain discs, the volume has to be turned up quite a bit, and the higher it is, the louder that buzzing is as well. It is connected using the included cables, my TV is a 35" SD which lacks an HDMIso perhaps the buzzing i caused by those cables. I can live with it though.
wish i had purchased the silver, but for 200 dollars this camera holds its own, great stability and structurally sound, stupid-proof piece of technology, easy to use. @mstewart_va
These speakers have fantastic sound for their size/price and very easy to use - with no speaker wire! I bought two in time for a dinner party, one upstairs and another down. Easy to set up, great music options, fantastic sound, all synchronized and controllable from my phone! It is refreshing to get a quality product that works as advertised for a reasonable spend.
This mini is idea for doing anything gaming, downloading movies or music, doing business or just surfing the web, the down side is when ever playing movies or stream the battery dies quickly.
This is my third Sonos Play 1 this year (master bedroom, master bath and office). Also have a Play 5 for the main and larger room. Awesome sound and great versatility offered by Sonos. I use the sleep timer every night too. I am planning to order another Play 5 for the kitchen area to pair with the other come January (have to have two of the same speaker to pair). Great sound at a great price. Piece of cake to set up - two minutes or less - intuitive for the end user. What is really nice is the fact that if you move, Sonos moves with you. Can't beat that.
This simply works, no problems so far! It is so much smaller than the one it replaced. Picture quality is great as well
I owned a Roku 2 for a while and appreciated the intuitive interface and straightforward setup. I bought the Roku 3 for my parents and was very satisfied with the new hardware and remote. Everything runs much faster and the on screen menu system is as easy to use as ever. This is a great product for people who don't always feel comfortable with the latest technology.
Works fine . Was uncertain about the 5MP but looks much better than I expected. I love being able to control it with the I-Phone app and also seeing the Picture real time makes it easier to aim. The +/- 4 second delay is a bit distractive but still useful. Bought a EEEkit to take it Zip lining, Caving and Snorkling in Costa Rica on our Honeymoon. That gave us all the different mounts we needed and some for the motorcycle as well.
I'm persnickety guy so not much gets my approval. I'm also a technology snob as my wife calls me. With that being said this is a solid and we'll built machine. I was immediately impressed with the build quality when I opened the box. This computer has excellent battery life, intuitively designed and just is fantastic. Well done Toshiba.
The reviews are correct. Incredibly easy setup, great streaming quality on our existing router with 0 skips or delays or buffers. Really good sound quality. Only thing I wish was that it would work with Spotify without Spotify forcing me into a subscription. But doesn't really matter as Pandora rocks and we can use our own purchased music library. Highly recommend the Sonos system.
Best thing EVER!!!! I don't know when, but I had messed up my headphone jack and it only played out of one channel <left>. I said...oh well I will buy some blue-tooth headphones, really good ones....well they don't show up under my audio devices so i cant listen to jack sqaut with them. I ran across this USB audio adapter and BAM perfect solution. Sound quality is really good and totally fixed my issues for less than ten dollars. Once you plug it in the laptop speakers turn off instantly. This fixed my issue and I am good to go! The only downside is it may block another USB connection so if you only have a couple USB connections, you will need to count on this taking up the space of two. It would be nice if is was just a headphone adapter without the mic. but for the money, it is awesome!
I bought a plug-in microphone to use with my MacBook and was originally unable to use it because the computer did not have a audio input plug. This cheap (not an insult) little adapter made it work and I was recording in seconds. Thank you
A great little tool for the laptop. It allows me to use two memory sticks, the digital camera and an external hard drive. Takes very little room, but delivers so much.
Daughter wanted it to play our 45 and LP's records (really large CD's for those really young). Seems to play well and has options to adjust speed and save digitally. This is not a high fidelity unit. If you're an audiophile, you probably won't be happy. But if you want to save in digital format, or just flash back to the 70 and 80s, good unit.Cudos to Amazon for getting the order moving after an extended backorder.
I just wanted to upgrade my 2005 Ford focus Radio to something with an auxiliary input. Works and sounds great :-) My picture is before and after.
I have the Diana camera with the instant back and bought a ton of this film. Yes it's a little spendy but when my friends had a goodbye party moving across the country, nothing made a better gift than 20 small instant photos of their friends at their last party. Sure you could take a bunch of pictures on your digital but this was a conversation starter and I did take a bunch of pictures on the digital and none of them came out as fun. Very good quality, quick mailing, good service!
I have had this phone for a good five months now and I have thoroughly enjoyed it! It has a few defaults that you may want to change, like auto scrolling at others, but it has a Great camera and a friendly O.S. but that's another default that you may want to change, from what I have heard, it's quite easy to get Google Play Store on this phone, but I can honestly say that I haven't missed it at all. I love "Firefly" and use it often. I really like that it comes with a "free" year of
I have the roku 2 and have enjoyed it for awhile before it kept freezing and had to be reset everyday. The roku 3 was doing great until it started not showing shows. I read some blogs saying an upgraded hdmi cord was need so I order and newer one and haven't had any issues since.
What could I said about a product that it is iconic already? yes it may be a symbol of consumerism and really good marketing. But even with all different tablets on the market Ipad has become kind of standard to compare other tablets.
This version keeps my laptop cool during the long hours that I'm on it & the motor is so light that I hardly even hear it (a plus when I'm online in webinar meetings). I hope this item lasts me as long as the other version I had from this company.
Sick of spending an obscene amount on headphones for your computer? Then get this and a cheaper pair of headsets with no USB plug and BAM you will be set for life. This product with a pair of nice 20 dollar headphones from Staples and I have been set for years.
I have had this for a few months and it replaced a netgear n600 which was getting sketchy on its connections and lag times. Easy setup. App lets you see what is connected at all times and block and control what you want. I have at least 15 devices connected with several streaming for TVs and have had no issues or flinching since installation. Very happy so far.
Great little record player! I bought this to use in my dorm room, and its great. The speakers aren't super loud but any simple speakers will solve this problem. The pitch knob and tone knob are great to get a better sound. Also something I didn't know when buying this is that it transfer records to mp3s. Great little record player over all!

i was skeptical about this stereo, but i hooked it up with a amp and new speakers, it sounded great!! i use flash drive and sd cards with tons of songs, it picks up were you left off when you restart the car, best part flash drives dont skip like cd's!!! great for off roaders!!
Solved my 900 mhz Internet problem after much tinkering, antenna aiming, replacing cables and general hair pulling. Should have started with this. Took a screen shot of my old router settings before I swapped them. Entered the settings in the new router and used the install wizard. Took a couple days to start working well consistently, but I think that was just related to the radio side of my Internet connection. I was my daughter's hero for at least a day. Ok, maybe not an entire day.
I have an HP G72 laptop that started complaining about its battery. This unit appears to be original HP equipment. The original battery had "Replace with HP spare 593553-001." This unit was described as being a replacement even though it is a 593554-001.This battery fit perfectly. It appears to hold a charge as well as the original. If performance holds up, this is an excellent value for the price.
I am soooo happy not to deal with windows, that I could dance :). This is a wonderful replacement for my laptop. I couldn't be happier. After learning a few keyboard tips and shortcuts, I've been able to make a fairly painless transition into the chromebook world. I highly recommend this.
This is my 4th Roku and 2nd Roku 3. They all perform well as long as you have a fairly fast router and WiFi connection, however the 3s seem to require more coverage on WiFi. The 3 is very fast and has loads of content to choose from which is available on all models. If you are looking to do a "cord cutting" Roku is a great choice.
The smart phone was a great buy without a contract. I purchased a sim card from the company I wanted to be with for 99 cents. I have a pay as you go card which gives me flexibility to change to a different cellular company if I'm not happy, without any early penalty charges. Happy!
This film fits the Instax Mini 8 camera and is easy to use. One film pack holds 10 photos. Since the film is pretty expensive, I bought in bulk for a better deal. Everyone is in awe when they see the photos pop out of the camera and it is always fun waiting for the image to finally appear. Voila! Like magic! It is wonderful having actual photos of friends and family pinned up that I can look at any time.
This phone I'm sure has made many wish they did not buy it, but like all devices it takes a bit of learning to get used too, I like it so far, was very easy to setup, called T-Mobile and they were able to activated onto my account without a hassle just had to go and get the sim card from T-Mobile Store, and Walla it was running, As mentioned earlier just need to learn how all functions work but the most important one is knowing how to make phone calls the rest will come with time, other than that it has so far been a great item
Excellent device, it's a pleasure to work on it, really.Special awards for the screen quality and the sound quality.For European potential buyers: I've received the device after few days from US in Italy, the only thing you have to do is to buy an European cable instead of the US one supplied with the device.
I've wanted an iPad for the longest and this has been by far the best bang for my buck. It came in its original package which is always a relief.. when I don't purchase items directly from the manufacturer it sometimes doesn't come in its original packaging which makes me a bit weary of the product. I've had this mini for two weeks now and definitely have gotten my money's worth! Being petite I did not need anything bulky but buyer beware, if your must haves include a large screen it'd be more practical to shell out the extra $80 for a regular sized iPad. Overall an A+++ for timely shipping and quality of product!
Great product! I love watching netflix onnit more so than on an android tablet that i bought for $60 for my daughters. Movies n shows r so clear on it n load fast with our wifi.Great size! Not too big, not too small :)
I bought this for like $25 and so far it has been the best $25 i have ever spent. With blue led lights, this baby adds a modern aftermarket touch to 2005 interior, it consumes less power than the stock radio, and it bangs amazing quality sound through my stock speakers.
We bought the S5 after reading some of the breathless reviews. The concept of high quality, easily mobile wireless audio technology has always been appealing, but it didn't ever quite seem ripe. Well, it is now.Setting up the S5 (if you don't have other Sonos equipment already, you're going to need the $99 Sound Bridge unless you only want to connect the S5 to your wired router . . . but why would you do that???) is about as easy as it gets. You tell it where your music is it indexes it, and it's all there, anywhere in your house, any time you want. The integration with Pandora, last.fm, and other internet radio is exceptional -- you would almost think they were proprietary services of Sonos, it's so well done.You do not need to be a computer geek or a technician to install or appreciate this device. I am the geek in our house; my wife could care less about technology. About the best recommendation I can make in this regard is this: my wife does not have the technical interest or desire to even attempt to use Pandora and last.fm in their traditional, computer-based formats. She was setting up stations and using all of them flawlessly and joyfully within hours of the S5 arriving at our home.If you have an iPhone and have any interest in this product, you won't be sorry.
This works great for connecting my printer and scanner or anything that does not need power from the USB port. While not tested, it may work less well for a web cam or charging a phone since they are powered by the port.
Performs exactly likes it's supposed to and as advertised. Especially good when considering that first attempt with a non Apple brand adapter proved to be an absolute failure.
Cheapest stereo I've ever bought for my car, lets me listen to my phone in the car, that's all I really needed :)
I think it is a nice little USB port. Isn't as large as I expected. I saw complaints about the light being too bright but it didn't bother me. it helps to know if you turned on that specific port.
This is my second one. I use it when I walk my golden retriever. The reception is unbelievable and the sound is so full for such a small radio. When i was looking for a small transistor radio I never thought Sony would have one in 2014 - Now 2015 bought another - Best small radio by far I have ever bought. You will not be disappointed. This little gem blows away all the others a fraction the cost.. (Simply Awesome Quality)
This is why i shop Amazpn. I read the other reviews before i bought this and decided to give it a go. I had bought an old used Acer standard laptop for 25 bucks on Craigslist. It was turning off and slowing down due to the heat emanating off of it constantly. This fixed it immediately and I havent had a problem since.
I don't have as many USB ports as I'd like on my computer. This little device is magic! I love that you and turn on and off which ports are in use, too.
I decided to purchase this record player because of the reviews and affordability. I was looking for something reliable and with good sound quality at a reasonable price. This product is perfect fo that. I've had this for about two month and use it almost every day and so far, nothing has been wrong with it. I strongly recommend this record player to anyone looking for one and who is on a budget
The wide angle lens and high-def, high fps framerate make this a great camera, especially for it's size. Throw in the underwater housing, and (FREE) remote control app (iOS & Android) and this thing is awesome!! I'm taking mine snowboarding in a week, hoping to look like the pros, will be happy to look like a high-def amateur.. XD
a small simple radio that works. my 87 year old mother has one and she brings it everywhere. i got one for myself also. And since then, i got three more to give as gifts
All the technical stuff about this chromebook has been said a thousand times over so I won't go there. I want to let people know that there are covers you can place on this chromebook that look amazing. There are also nice bags for this chromebook to protect your investment. I purchased both & it really makes this unit look even better as well as adding extra protection. I just want to add that everyone is talking about it's beautiful screen so hey, we may as well dress up the body too - just a thought !
This is a twin pack so you get 20 pictures total. If you have a fuji instax mini or a polaroid 300 this is the film to get. It works for both and is much cheaper in price than the polaroid film. Instant gratification.
It is small, compact and WORKS perfectly. It took 10 seconds to hook up to my TV; two plugs go into the Audio and one plug goes into the Video and the movie CD was ready to go. Color and sound wonderful, I am very pleased.
I needed this adapter so my iPhone5 could communicate with the 30-pin FOB required to open a Supra lockbox with an iPhone. Many of my co-workers have had problems with adapters, so I was concerned. That is why I bought the Apple Adapter and am glad I did. It has been very dependable which is exactly what you need when you want to enter a house for a showing.
I replaced the OEM battery with this battery about two months ago. It has worked very well, performing and holding a charge as well as the original battery did when it was new. I'd recommend this product and would buy it again.
I installed this and got it up and running in a few minutes. It increased range, so I can now easily get a good connection on my laptop and phone when I am in the back of the backyard.
This is wonderful. I have wanted a turntable for a long time, as I have quite a large library of vinyl that I have been auctioning off, but the price held me back. This was a great buy and works great for what I'm doing. If you're wanting an audiophile turntable this is NOT the one for you, but if you want to listen to those old records and bring back great memories of the days of AM radio and 45s this really fits the bill. Haven't tried recording from it yet, but everything I'll need seems to be there as well. Great fun at a great price.
Excellent! High Definition. Terrible shame that depends on Comcast internet service (in my case). I like that you can add extra channels and you can watch Amazon Prime, hulu, netfix and some free channels. I recommend it 100%. It's a great savings compared to Xfinity TV ($ 165 monthly 2tv + HD). With Roku savings is about $ 1,700 per year. I love the shortcut buttons on the control and the headphones.
So I've owned this product about 3 weeks now, and I can honestly say it's the most reliable and stable router I have owned to date. The provided instructions to set the router seemed simple enough, but it didn't wanna respond positively for about an hour and a half for some reason. I can't say why this happened, nor how I fixed it. I just kept messing with settings and it eventually started working properly. If you know about computers and it does this to you I would just stay diligent and keep trying. Hopefully the install will go smoother for other people. Ill update after some more time and after I move into a building that isn't made completely of concrete. I highly recommend it!
My second (and not last) Sonos purchase. Sonos continues to exceed expectations. Sound quality is excellent, set up couldn't be easier. The only thing that slightly disappoints is that you cannot play Amazon Prime music with this system! I hope this functionality is added ASAP.
This little guy does great. I carry it around the house each morning to listen to the news without turning on the full stereo. The batteries last a long time (weeks) with regular use.
I just love this phone. I loved it so much I bought one for My husband. I am not a geek and yet the phone has been easy to use. I have not missed Google at all! Every application made for this phone has worked great. I think that this phone is the best on the market right now. It has the best of both worlds. I had a iPhone, and my hubby had a Android OS. Since I was.used to iPhone I thought this phone would be hard to use. It has been great to use and understand. My husband has not had a hard time with this phone either. customer service is wonderful also.
I've been a Prime member for years and rarely leave reviews but I had to endorse this product as soon as I plugged it in. I have a Yoga laptop and this cooler works perfectly! You know how you whole body gets hot when your laptop heats up? Well this will help that issue since the fan also cools your lap. This was a really good deal. Very excited with the purchase.
A gift for someone and they love the mini. I wish I had gone down that path. One of the best buys I have ever made
I've had the full HD version for a week or two and I can honestly say that it has surpassed my already high expectations. In one word, it's fantastic. I'm used to macbook pros and I already like this more. It boots up instantaneously, it's surprisingly fast, there is no clutter or things I don't want, it's so deliciously light, and the screen, well the screen is amazing. I know this is minor but I really love the wallpapers from Yosemite, but Crome's wallpapers, on this screen, blow them away. I know you wouldn't buy anything for the wallpapers but from the moment I opened it I was in love. Honestly I use computers mostly for internet so this is perfect for me, I can surf reddit, watch youtube videos and shop amazon, what more do you really need. I haven't tried any video or picture editing apps or anything like that, that's not why I bought it. My greatest concern was life without word, and so far google docs, etc, works fine. I'm not entirely used to them and there are still things I'll need to learn, but I'm fine with leaving office. And if you want too, you can download a word app, but I like google docs. I was worried about uploading documents online from google docs, such as resumes, and at first I was only able upload them as google docs, but don't worry, you can download your document in a couple different formats, such as docx and pdf. The docx messed the format up a little but the pdf version was perfect. So, I easily uploaded my resume as a pdf from google docs. Honestly it's hard to believe this laptop is around 300 dollars, you could easily fool people into thinking it cost more, much more. Highly recommend this product. I will update if things change.
This is a pretty straight forward product so I don't have any specific comments or complaints. I have a FujiFilm Instax Mini & I had run out of film so I ordered replacement film. It was exactly what it said it was, and it got here in time for my trip.
This is phenomenal, and easily worth the $448 I spent. The sound is exquisite, and it's mind-boggling to think of how much music is at one's fingertips. Just this morning I listened to Nick Drake, Jeri Southern, Brook Benton, and Mel Torme; they all sounded great. To anybody who has reservations about buying this, please take my word: you won't regret it. I can only vouch for the Sonos 5--haven't heard the 1 or 3.

Great little affordable record player. The self contained speakers sound justi fine. This is perfect for somebody who loves records but is on the move or doesn't have a huge stereo system.
These things are ridiculous, really big sound in a small package. We use this in our office and it can send high quality sound through the whole complex. I cant use it at home because of the dependence on WiFi, if you have weak or slow signal or spotty coverage the speakers will disappoint.If your signal is strong and your internet has high bandwidth, there is almost nothing better for the money.
I have debated buying the Sonos system for several months mostly due to price and also in part wondering if it could truly live up to the claims and reviews. I am fairly technical and am usually an early adopter, although have at times, been disappointed with other purchases not working quite as well as advertised. I am thrilled with all aspects of my Sonos purchase and cannot believe how easy it was to set up and the sound quality. I received it about an hour ago, and in minutes, had the Zone Bridge connected to my router (since the router is kept hidden in a closet out of sight) and then the S5 ZonePlayer set up in my living room. I can now stream my iTunes Library from a Time Capsule (NAS) and listen to streaming music from Pandora, Last.fm, Sirius and more. Plus, as a transplanted Minnesotan in New York, I can save my favorite local stations from MN and listen to them here as if I were at home. The music is flawless, crystal clear and I would never know it is from the internet- no stutters, gaps or delay. This is one product that has surpassed my expectations completely. The only downside I can see will be now wanting to buy another S5 for my bedroom.
I was scared I was going to get a fake battery because I seen other reviews for other sellers about them sending another brand of battery but advertising an HP. This one is the real deal. It came sooner than I expected and works great. It gives me a good 3 hours of power after charged. Just remember to leave your laptop off and charge it first for 8 hrs. then drain it completely and then charge it again at least once a month to keep your battery working good.
i take it everywhere i go, films great. i normally do 1080p which films at 29.97 fps or so. which isn't THAT bad but you do notice the lag when you switch it to 720p at 60 frames lol. dramatic difference but i like the better quality of 1080p, perfect for what i do within budget. bought the gopro frame for it which was a huge difference in sound quality and size. still sturdy enough to drop a few times and take a shock or two. definately would recommend it to those vloggers out there like me who use it outside alot and would hate to have the sound go to crap because of the housing it comes with! thanks gopro for a quality product.there are a few cons about the battery freezing up that i saw people complain about. yes it does do it rarely but all you gotta do is just undo the battery from the back and plop it back in and it starts back up. i leave my wifi off because it drains the battery SO Bad. extremely fast. and without a battery pack of some sort to keep it charged while filming. it will die within an hour of continuous filming.
I was very pleased with the gopro. A 32gb sd card definitely holds enough footage for any day of action, up to 4.5 hours in 1080p. The waterproof casing held strong under 30-40 feet of water and takes better still pictures than most smartphones. I would recommend watching a video on how to clean the casing, as an improper cleaning can cause condensation and blurring of videos and pictures. Overall, it is a great product.
Set up myself in minutes... walks you though every step. This is a must have to stream Amazon and Netflix to the TV. Stays on so when you come back to view another movie it downloads in seconds. Very happy with this product. I read all the reviews before purchasing and I can only say that if a 70 year young woman can make this work, anyone can :)
I purchased one and then purchased another for my niece and I just bought a third one for back up , just in case. I absolutely love them. Quiet, slim, no problems at all. First one purchased in March 2014, next one in Nov 2014, the third one just today. I go through keyboards faster than fans. Maybe Cool Master needs to design keyboards...LOL
After some research, I chose the HERO3 vs. newer versions, just because I won't use it as often to necessitate the price difference. In particular, wanted to use for scuba diving and it worked out just as intended with great picture quality. Was worried about underwater case leaking but didn't encounter any issues despite multiple uses over consecutive days (definitely recommend cleaning it thoroughly after each use to prevent corrosion or debris from breaking seal. These weren't actually problems for me, but still recommend, per manufacturer recommendations). Manual scrolling to device options via buttons is a bit laborious but it is manageable. Appreciate the range of photo options, as well as video setting. Great to have the GoPro app for fairly easy review after filming; if I understand correctly, there is the LCD screen accessory that could be purchased to do this, but I haven't tried it yet. Nice to be able to charge camera while still viewing video via app. It has a great lightweight, compact design, making it easy to travel with and store. Overall, terrific camera!
I really enjoy it. It's lightweight and the screen is so bright and clear. It's easy to take with you wherever you go
I love the Roku interface. My mother is hard of hearing so the headphone enabled remote makes her life easier. Incredibly easy to use, well worth the money.
Works great. I knew (and like) that this cord was very short, so I have been very happy with this purchase. I've had it for over a year, use it often and it's still working like new. Recommended.
Upgraded from first generation Roku and WOW, what a difference. Increased processor speed is great. Channels and apps load super fast. Nice user interface. Easy hookup. Lots of free channels to choose from.
It works and looks really cool, no pun intended. Not a gamer, but now and again I'll have a laptop that will start running hot. Sometimes it needs to be cleaned out, other times there's a bigger problem. Either way, having something like this around can really be valuable whether I'm going to eventually fix it permanently or not. The ability to set variable speeds is nice, and the fact that it runs off USB and doesn't require its own transformer.
This film is a bargain. Fits the Polaroid mini camera and is less expensive than the Polaroid film. Have ordered this a couple of times from Amazon now and will probably order again.
Love laying in bed and reading; it's later than many books I've read. I love how I can hold it with one hand while I am able to navigate with my other hand.
So amazing 43500 on antutu bench mark!! Amazing phone, now running 4.4.4 with April's 20th update, custom wallpaper, android wear, New lock screen backgrounds, faster on benchmark was 40,000, Google now launcher now works, lg g watch works! Many more great things
Got it for a decent price and using it as we speak the deliverer sucked cause he just left it out in the open but good thing I was home and got it before someone else did. He didn't even knock or ring my doorbell
great little radio, i bought it to use in finding dog fence wire brake. I mounted it on the end of a piece of plastic pipe and with a roll of wire as a RF choke it works quite well for a wire brake detector. the only down side is finding the actual brake point, it will get you as close as an expensive detector, i just bought an actual detector and it fails to find the actual brake the same way. save your money and by this radio.
We ordered this to hook up to an old fashioned TV for our kids to watch their DVDs. It works great and I love how compact it is. Came with the cables to hook it up to the TV, and was packaged carefully and shipped quickly. 100% pleased so far.
This speaker is excellent. I have it in a bedroom and it sounds great. I could probably use another one to fill the room with music ... and its on my list of things to purchase.
We love our new Roku 3!! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to pricey cable or satellite services. We are truly enjoying it and are so happy with this purchase.
This product allows me to use my 30 pin connectors on my new iPhone 6. I connect to older docking stations to play music and to my I home clock radio to charge and play music. Short cord but not a problem connecting to my devices.
Works perfectly with my hackintosh. No drivers needed. I was forced to get this because Yosemite kept disabling the audio after sleep. This resolved that problem!
got a bose? file down 1/32 down around from the base of plug to phone and 1/16 from base of plug back. phone will charge and play back music its worth the money just a little time with small file modifying is all. don't buy cheap we get what we pay for. very good quality.
AWESOME!!!! Got my iPad in 2 days (just in time for my cruise) it is perfect and exactly what the details said. I have an IPhone, A MacBook Pro, and now an IPad. I'm a very very satisfied customer.
I taped this to the back of my all-in-one screen, works great. There are little buttons to turn on/off each slot. I wish I had bought the longer one.
This battery is also recommended for the HP laptop class advertised. I purchased this for a friend's HP and it works very well. Delivery was on time and as promised.
I bought this because it saves a lot of money than buying the one in smaller packs. Overall the film are in great condition, and the shipping was pretty fast.
SO FAR SO GOOD! It plays the DVDs just fine. I bought all the old Johnny Carson TV DVDs for my Intellectually Challenged Brother. This is a small compact DVD player, which is nice. It fits perfectly under my light weight flat screen that my brother watches when he eats. I think it is a nice quality little DVD player. So if it lasts a long time I will be happy.
I purchased my first Instax camera a little over a month ago. I got the Instax 50s camera for a trip and this is the film for it. It takes a bit of figuring out your preferred settings on the camera, but as far as the film is concerned... it is fantastic! Great vintage look. Great color! I am really in love with everything about this product! I thought the size might be a little on the small side, but I find that I really love the size. I purchase cheap card holder books here on amazon to put them in and they fit perfectly! EVERYONE loves these! Become an instant artist, and fall in love with these little pictures!
It has exceeded my expectations! HP wanted over $150 for the exact same battery but purchased thru HP. I saved a ton and got the same exact battery...it's working GREAT!!!
Take the waterproof case off and it's a great camera for vlogging. I use it daily. its so tiny with such power, the quality is amazing, I don't feel like im sacrificing quality for a small camera.it doesnt have a screen but as a vlogger I mainly have the camera turned at me anyway and cant see a screen. and as for when I turn it away from me and have to record something else I think just years of holding a camera lets me know what I'm pointing at.my complaint is that it beeps so much! turning it on, 3 beeps, turning it off 9 beeps! so many beeps!
I don't know how this compares to other devices, but it's exactly what I needed. I like that the ports can be switched on and off to avoid draining power when not in use. I have a portable blu-ray that requires two USB ports, so this way I don't have to stop using everything else when I need to use it with my 13" laptop.
It says "made in Thailand" and does not look identical to the original battery my HP laptop came with. It does work as expected, however. Performance is roughly the same as the original battery when it was new. It's been working fine for a month now. Much less expensive compared to the other MU06 battery on Amazon. I'll update this if I encounter anything unexpected or troubling.
I've bought 2 Fujifilm cameras that require this film and the 2-pack for $13 is definitely the best deal. Don't be fooled by the 5-pack for almost $50 or the 2-pack for $18.99. If you browse through Amazon, or wait a little while, this $13 one will show up. Sometimes, it is not Prime eligible, but even when I bought it without the expedited shipping, it came in 4 days. My friends love the Fujifilm throwback instant pics and the mini pictures that make everyone look good! Get this pack; it's the cheapest!
You probably do not get the most amazing performance, but for music and video this does just fine.Has worked for probably about a year now, and I hope it stays that way.
Best thing EVER!!!! I don't know when, but I had messed up my headphone jack and it only played out of one channel <left>. I said...oh well I will buy some blue-tooth headphones, really good ones....well they don't show up under my audio devices so i cant listen to jack sqaut with them. I ran across this USB audio adapter and BAM perfect solution. Sound quality is really good and totally fixed my issues for less than ten dollars. Once you plug it in the laptop speakers turn off instantly. This fixed my issue and I am good to go! The only downside is it may block another USB connection so if you only have a couple USB connections, you will need to count on this taking up the space of two. It would be nice if is was just a headphone adapter without the mic. but for the money, it is awesome!
This camera is awesome! I was able to get some really cool pictures and videos on my trip to Hawaii. I would post the pictures up on Facebook and everyone would comment on how nice the pictures were. I only had a problem when it would not turn on for some reason, and 1 time throughout the week i used it it froze and wouldn't turn off but i just took the battery out and put it back in. The fish eye effect makes the pictures different. It was worth buying it! My iPhone 5s would not take pictures or film videos the way this did!
This unit satisfied me completely. Simple, reliable, improved the sound over the original recordings, what more can you ask.
I worried about the GoPro getting damaged when my son described the wet and wild plans he had for it. This protects it from water and mishandling. We got it both quickly and in brand new condition. If we need another, after this one is destroyed, we will order from this seller. Thank you...
Very easy to install and if you have a download speed of 10mps it works flawlessly. If you do not own a smart tv then this is your best solution. The only downside is that it does not include an HDMI cord which you have to purchase separately.
Changed the way we use TV. Don't know why we delayed purchase of this technology for so long. Easy to install. Needed to purchase only an HDMI cable.
If your looking for a good cheap head unit it is great. It is kind of cheap and the wiring took me a while to figure out but works great for my needs
A cheap stereo, only usable to plug my MP3 player....but that's exactly what I wanted and it's working exactly as intended. I think it's a good buy for it's price.
I just received wireless controller and S5 today. Not paying attention to dimension specs I was little surprised by smaller then expected size. However in some cases size does not matter and this is the one that it is true. Sound quality is very good for portable device that can be easily moved to your deck or other room. Moving S5 is as simple as removing power cord and reconnecting it in new location. Setup of Pandora, last.fm and mp3 library was very intuitive (for initial setup use your computer, which makes this much easier). I use iphone with Sonos app that again is very easy to use and has all needed options to control the system. The good news is that you control Sonos with many devices including computer, iphone, etc. When I was buying it I was not sure if that is the case. With service like Pandora, last.fm you basically can stop buying music and discover new artists that you did not know. Another compatible great service is radiotime that works like a charm. Since it is not possible to see device locally I was little skeptic that it may not deliver what it promises and price doesn't belong to lowest. To my surprise I am very happy with it and will definitely keep it. I will probably get one or two more of these in near future (if you are planning one, be warned that you will want more).
This radio is excellent! If you're looking for a simple transistor radio with a speaker to keep in your go bag or next to your flashlight for when the power goes out, this is it. The speaker is loud enough to hear from across the room. No, it's not in stereo. The earphone jack is even in mono. As other reviewers have pointed out, if you want sound in both ears of your stereo headphones, you'll need an adapter. It's not a block rockin boom box, an MP3 player, an alarm clock, or a dishwasher... It's just a plain old transistor radio like everyone had in the 1970's, and it's very good at what it does! Thanks Sony!
It's a wrongfully bought item and by the time I start to use it, it's over 30 days later and realized that I got the wrong item and therefore it can't be returned. I need something like this one but w/ a CD player that can read MP3 files. This unit doesn't have a CD player. Ouch! That's what happens when you order while doing something else. Multi-tasking doesn't pay well
This machine is wonderful! We choose it because we have some very old 78 records that we could not listen to as the victrola that used to play them is not functional. We also chose it because it enables us to connect to our computer to download the records and then burn them to cds. This turntable is great because it plays 33, 45, and 78 records. We look forward to putting our entire record collection on cds eventually. The sound is great and because the speakers are built in it is a spacesaver.
Actually this is a great Receiver. Installed in my pickup and really enjoyed it so far. Had it for several months now. Very impressed. It has stiffer buttons but its not bad and has some good features.
I was looking for a compact old-school radio to listen to AM baseball games on, which iheart radio blocks. It fits the bill. The speakers are surprisingly good

Great radio. All the wired were clearly labeled making hooking up the harness a snap. It even included the little bars to pull out the old radio. Great media connections. Surprised me by reading my wife songs through the usb connection to her mp3 player. The units is physically very small thanks to the ommission of a cd player. Has accepable though not amazing sound quality. Very happy with my purchase.
It is EXACTLY what I imagined: a little record player that won't wow you with sound but lets chill in your room to 33's and 45's like an OG. My hinas love when I start playing them oldies on it. Something about the little hiss of a record and the mesmerizing spin just gets them all riled up and in the mood. Wish I had bought this sooner. Getting all kinds of tails and I got Jensen to thank for it. Big Ups, Jensen. You done right by me.
This is the second unit of the same radio that I have purchased in about a one year time span. Purchased both radios for my father who has in my opinion abused the heck out of it. The unit I purchased a year ago still works after having been dropped numerous times, the antenna broken off, the battery door missing, and the batteries being crammed in. I will say that tuning in a station is a bit tricky but it keeps my aging father happy. I should note that my father only listens to AM news and sports stations.
This DVD was a life saver. My daughter is 4 and slightly addicted to Disney. Her previous DVD player in her TV died, the playstation 2 only played half the DVDs and this compact DVD player effortlessly plays EVERYTHING! Even the scratched ones! No buzzing or problems! Cheap price so might buy another for the other room
I bought this item as a replacement for an older DVD player in my child's room. The price was right, as we were looking for a cheaper unit so we wouldn't be out much money if the little ones tore it up. I wasn't expecting much when I got it, as all I was needing was for it to just play movies. To my surprise this is amazing. It plays great, shows an amazing picture, and loads without any issues. Really simple to use and loved that it came with a remote. Will definitely consider purchasing this unit again in the future and was worth taking the risk on.
I didn't know which battery to buy to replace mine. When I contacted my HP office their battery was going to cost over $125. I took a chance with this one and I am very pleased. It came in a timely manner and works just fine. The price is extremely reasonable. I now know where to purchase my battery replacements.
This phone is truly under-rated! What needs to be understood about this phone is that it's not like the others. Amazon made it to be used with gestures, and with like everything new, you need to get used to it. once you do, you'll love it. if you buy this phone remember that you will be getting a great product, but its the consumers job to learn how to use it. once you do, you will love it. one thing amazon could do is make it easier to side load the google play store. i understand that google is amazon's competitor but this phone would be selling like hot cakes if people could still use some things that google offers like gmail or some games that are on the play store and not on the amazon repo. i hope this helps
Has changed how I deal with mobil computing to be sure. I like the compact size and native apps like camera and music. It's my traveling radio station, digital camera and 'laptop'. Highly recommended. There are some functions that you have to find out through osmosis, tricks you have to dig out through various sources, but nothing that can't be learned if you ask the right person, or find those hints on line.
We live in a large house with several large rooms and this is an excellent speaker system. No complaints at all. We use it all the time. I really recommend the Play 3 over the Play 1. Sound and features are such a better value. We have a Play 1 as well, but wish we had purchased two Play 3s instead.
Bought this hoping it would make my laptop run like NEW again and as soon as I put it in, IT DID! It holds a charge for hours and Im now mobile again. If your battery has died, purchase this product it's worth the money.
it came fast also I had no problems with it. the usb sound card worked for what I needed it to do and it did more then I needed ti to do. I needed it for me to use my mic no my turtle beach ear force x12 on my ps3 but when it did more when I needed it to do it worked. I used it on my pc and mac when my Logitech headset died I used it and it word well. so if you are looking at this item BY THE S*** OUT OF IT
I suppose I'm an idiot for thinking the speaker itself was wireless, so if anyone else is as ignorant as myself you now know the speaker must be plugged in to use. Once you download the app for your device, and plug in the speaker, your listening to music within seconds. Considering the small size of this speaker, the sound of the music is exceptional. Make it loud enough and you feel like you're in a recording studio.
Heat is the greatest enemy of the laptop computer. Every laptop I have had die on me died from heat issues. This cooler has one HUGE fan that puts out a lot of air and doesn't seem to draw much power. Protect your laptop, keep it cool. This may be the best way to do that.
this has stopped my laptop shutdown issues. is quiet. fan is even as it blows on the underside of the laptop. adjusts well to angles. can have on lap with no discomfort
omg I am loving my new mini ipad. it is my 2nd one. it was hard to find a lower price ipad but you have to be careful when you shop. make sure it is a brand new one.
I purchased one and then purchased another for my niece and I just bought a third one for back up , just in case. I absolutely love them. Quiet, slim, no problems at all. First one purchased in March 2014, next one in Nov 2014, the third one just today. I go through keyboards faster than fans. Maybe Cool Master needs to design keyboards...LOL
whoever uses these films know that these can get a little pricey. but 50 sheets for this price is a great deal. plus with the speedy service i got my film just in time for a great disney adventure with my nieces.
Excellent little hub, works well as a powered, switching usb hub. Unsure about speeds for read/write through this device; if that is your concern, then there might be other high speed, non-switching hubs better suited.
I love it the features are great my only thing that don't like that I can't use 4g data only 2g data and the fact that I didn't get any manual telling you about the phone an it features but it's way better than the s5
Router has been great with very good throughput. The admin interface is not the best and seems to be little finicky, but once you have this setup you shouldn't need to be in there much.
I previously had an original iPad and it was becoming very outdated (IOS). After purchasing the new iPad Mini, I am thrilled with the speed. I also love having a camera built in. I still have lots to learn about it, but I love it so far.
The screen is brilliant and fantastic. I read a lot of reviews about the different Chromebooks, and this Toshiba is definitely the best overall Chromebook out there as of today's date. Highly recommended if you are thinking about a Chromebook.
Not a bad little stereo, especially for the money. I have not experienced the issues that some other reviews have stated, like reception, lighting, and charging of cell phone. Installation instructions are vague but not a problem for any stereo shop or mechanically, or electronically inclined individual. Also it's so light weight that I thought they had sent me an empty box. Another note that may be of help is that there is a delayed shut-off so give it a minute before you think you've wired it wrong.
this product just works, right out of the box. the remote control was able to be programmed to my tv so i dont need a pair of remotes. it runs quietly and reacts quickly to whatever you tell it to do. lightweight and good looking. it just works!
I purchased this turn-table as a Christmas present for my boyfriend because it had such wonderful reviews. While it may not be much of a looker, the quality is surprising for the price-point. I initially planned to purchase one of those Crosley portable players, but after reading the reviews for those, I decided to choose function over form. So far, there have been no complaints. Sound quality is fine for us, the controls are nice, the size is perfect, and it is easy to use.
I opened the box, followed the instructions, and was running wi-fi in less than 10 minutes. I had read a review that stated the user interface was not very intuitive. I didn't find that to be the case. If you have ever installed a wireless router before, you should find this to be a simple task. If this is your first wireless router, it may take you a bit longer. Performance is great. I updated from an old a/g/n router and the speed difference is visibly notable. Seems to be a fast router at a great price point.
So far, so good. Product does exactly what I need it to do, I'm getting a kick out of listening to some old vinyl albums. Maybe if I get serious, I'll upgrade, but this does the job fine.
It was a pain when my laptop crashed during the game because of overheating. Now, I can play the game without worrying about a overheating,
I love the phone. I waited months for it to go in sale for 189$ it was worth it. It is quick. Easy to handle and the photo quality is amazing! I wouldnt get another phone. The only down part is that there is no cute phone cases like iphone. You will have to go to Snapmade.com and make one if you desire cute. And the app store is different. For example amazon doesn't have snapchat sadly. They have some chinese brand called Snapgrab. Its awful. But if they updated the app store to have it and etc then great. But for the most part it has every other app out there except snapchat lol. But i would suggest this phone to anyone.
For what it is, a compact wireless speaker, the Sonos Play:1 is an excellent piece of kit, as the Brits say. Well-built, well-designed, easy to use and good sound in a small package. Great addition to the Sonos speaker lineup.
I got this to listen to the Cincinnati Reds games and it works great. Decent reception and sound quality. I wish there was a little more play in the tuning knob but it works for what I need it.
listen to me for the price this is a great radio it does the job its light weghit easy to install and a great product i cant remember i think it came with a renote not sure oh ya and works great with a sub system so stop putting it off and just but it ok u wont regret it
Between my cordless mouse, my Garmin Vivofit and my scanner, I had a gang of things hooking up to my laptop. I decided to order this so anytime my laptop was brought home, I could hook up one Hub instead of each of my products. I was concerned that this wouldn't function as it should because of the terrific price, but since it had good reviews, I decided to give it a try. Believe what you read about this USB Hub. It's exactly what I wanted, it works great, and is easy to use (just plug it in). I highly recommend this!
awesome specs for the price if you can get it on sale around 200. Easily can add Google launcher & play and keep the Amazon ui also. Fyi Remember to swipe up in chrome to go back a page on this phone. Took me awhile to figure that out.

Everything came exactly as I wanted and it was very fast shipping. I am very happy with this company. The only thing was that my film box was the same fujifilm instax mini, except the picture wasn't of a girl, but instead two girls (must be an updated version). However I still got my 20 film pieces and it fits into my instax mini 8 film camera, so i'm happy :)
Purchased to enable use of iPhone 6 in home and car (VW) stereo system. Worked perfectly in both cases and I can control the media with my car touch screen system just as I could with my previous iPhone.
After a month the router is performing well. One or twice I had to reset the router because none of the devices were connecting. Other than that is good for the price. Set up couldl be better.
I got this player because half of my movies on my sylvania portable DVD player wouldn't show subtitles, and that's not cool, because I can no longer hear.
I was very excited about this phone to begin with, but wow. I use Amazon for everything so having it all on one device is awesome.I only have issues with getting used to the operating system, however that's just my fault. I love the ease and simplicity this phone has to offer. I only wish the Appstore had some of my favorite games without having to pay an arm and leg. But again that has nothing to with the phone. If your looking for a great phone with great design and feel then then look no further.
Went back to Roku after trying Amazon Fire. Convenience was most important. Fire did not have all the channel access Roku has. This Roku 3 is much faster than previous Roku 3 and comparable to Fire's speed.
This 50 pack of Fujimax Intax mini film is worth the money you're paying for. Just remember to take your photos wisely, because these films do run out pretty quickly .
Brought this radio cause after I bought my car was strapped for cash and it was worth it but the memory card slot never worked but hey it was twenty dollars so I didn't mind everything else worked fine
Love, love, love my min I-pad. Would hate to be without it. Wish I had the regular one too. Love Apple product. Recently went from a I phone to the Samsung Galaxy 5. Big mistake. Wish I had my old I phone back.
My friend's laptop was getting a lot of feedback from his headphone ports so i bought this for him to use instead.It works awesome and no feedback whatsoever!
I bought a Bose sound station when I got my iPhone 4- I paid a good amount for it so I needed a converter for the 30 pin to the lightening pin. This is perfect and works great!
The iPad has some significant scratches on the back but I purchased mine refurbished so I guess that's to be expected. I just wish that it would have been a little more clear on the description, BUT hey I love my ipad mini! I purchased it because my regular iPad was getting too big to haul around in my purse so the purchase of this one definitely wasn't necessary. All in all i'm very happy with my purchase!
I thought that since this was a 2.0 usb that there would be some problems. But it works great! The sound is very good, as if it is coming out of the mini jack. I have only used this on MacOS so I can't speak for the performance on a PC. For either platform, just be sure to select the proper output. Also, I advise using a usb extender with this so you don't run the risk of damaging your usb port if your headphone cord moves around.
My old PC is an i5, 8gb of RAM so it starts up pretty fast too; but i am still amazed with this machine's speed (4GB of RAM is pretty reasonable for this OS; please do not get the 2GB version). Loving the track-pad and all of its gestures (sliding to go back and forth, 3-finger-scrolling, 2-finger-scrolling; basically just like a Mac trackpad-- really convenient). Loving the keyboard, I like the feel when typing. The screen is the best of all, after having this baby I don't think I will ever be able to buy a laptop without an IPS display. Compared to Mac Retina screen, I seriously see no different, if not saying that the Chromebook screen is a little bit better and brighter. Thin and light-weight. I only own this baby for a month or so, but been loving it so far! Highly recommend this product! (if you don't need to edit video or photo, this can really be your primary machine!)
I just got it. It's awesome so far. I'm trying to install Google Play but i must say that i linked my Gmail accounts with the native email app and they work properly. I'll write more about it but so far i'm happy with. Screen is awesome. It's fast, good sound, etc
Sounds Amazing and works well with 2 other Play 1s and a soundbar. Size is perfect and completely fills a larger bathroom with sound (and base).
I did a lot of research on something that would play music wireless controlled by android phones and tablets. I was thinking about a Bluetooth radio, but ran across this device. I also bought the bridge so I could set this up in a remote location. (Sun room). Easy to set up. Just plugged them in, ran the software to add music and boom! There it was! It sounds amazing! A little on the pricey side but for the sound quality and great control apps, it is worth it! Now, for the only con which is minor to me. You can't play music to the system directly from your phone or tablet (music stored on phone or tablet) unless you plug cable from phone to back of system. But here is my solution. I have a drop box account on my phone, tablet, and computer. Then I have the drop box file with music in my sonos library. So I can take a song from phone or tablet and share it to drop box folder then refresh sonos library, and it will then play on sonos! Great system!
I would have never known how dependent i would have become, dont onow how i functioned without an ipad for so long. And this item was such a good purchase. It was practically new. Great comunication from the seller. She told me that this item was used as a demo only, so no previous owner but the store to show to potention buyers
Previously used Roku 1. This Roku 3 is infinitely faster, more easily connected to my network by Wifi, and cuts down buffering time when watching videos, especially on the Hulu channel. the Netflix channel on this machine is much more slick and useful for browsing. A great purchase.
After reading all the reviews and along with the promotion of $199 and one year of prime free, I decided to buy the unlocked Fire phone. For the price and quality of the phone itself, it is a GREAT value. All the features are simple and intuitive to use. It is super fast for browsing, email, and basic work related functions. It syncs perfectly with Google accts. T-mobile contacts and call related items works perfectly. Just be aware that you need a NANO sim card to get the phone working. The camera is excellent.
Love my fire phone blows the iPhones out of the water and on to the moon. I got mine on a deal 200 bucks for the phone and a year of prime can't beat that
Arrived on time and intact. Plugged it in and added four more ports to my laptop. Added a stereo speaker using one port and a camera in the other. Worked fine. Quality is good.
So there are ever-declining reasons to have an AM/FM portable radio...but this does whatever you may need it for, flawlessly, and it costs about as much as a Cheeseburger at a sit-down restaurant..
As someone has mentioned before this film is compatible to Polaroid 300 cameras. So if you want to save a couple dollars on instant film you should definitely purchase Instax Mini film instead of the polaroid one. Its cheaper and the quality is the same :)
Very friendly interface. Packs a lot into a small package. As long as you have great WiFi or a good workaround like a MoCA then this works great at providing streaming media from multiple sources.
We connected an external hard drive to this router and loaded all out music onto it. Now any device hooked to this wifi router can access the media files on it and we can play them anywhere within range. It's a pretty sweet setup

I've had an older chromebook that has been dropped at least 4 times. There are things rattling inside but it still works. The mouse-pad is a bit touchy and really only works well with a mouse now. This is why I bought a new one. I converted from Mac about 2 years ago and have never looked back. This new chromebook is very light, has absolutely everything I need, speakers are fantastic, it's very light and easy to slip into my enormous purse. Plus, the screen is off the hook. The newest updates with design and such are great. I'd be surprised if I ever go back to a traditional laptop.
Read about this router on line so I thought I would give it a try. Glad I did this router has performed flawless easy to install. My download speeds are the fastest they have ever been. Would recommend this to anyone great router.
This is a great product. The wire on the device is great compared to the cheaper ones. Why pay for two at half the price that do not work versus one good one that works. It' s like getting two for the price of one in the long run.
Great Router! Worth the extra money increased my wi-fi range inside of house considerably. Dual band seems to never be lacking in our neighborhood, so bars are always ample. After updating firmware the phone app is cool too.
This 4 port USB 3.0 port worked excellently to replace my older and defective amazon basic 4 port. Ultimately this hub will give you the best bang for your buck, and I highly recommend it.

Love it! Changed my life! This is so far superior to cable, and so much cheaper, I'm amazed that there are still cords left to be cut. When I go visit my brother with cable, I'm always struck at how much I hate the experience of watching cable compared to Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, and few other channels on my Roku
Wanted a spare, usb 2.0 hub as it works very well, and connects my 3.0 devices to my old usb 2.0 computer, was having issues with usb 3.0 external drives not working consistantly when plugged into my old computers usb 2.0 port, with the hub, they work everytime...
This Sony product like all others, no matter the price, is top quality. Do not let the low price fool you! The Durable Remote control is a plus, and even batteries are included! The Construction of Top Quality Plastics and Metals come together to form a beautiful design. You can preform the following options while viewing movies, or listening to CDs as well; Fast Forward, Rewind, Slow Play, Fast Play, Pause and even use the included Remote to control volume on a connected Home entertainment system. At just $50.00 this would have been a Great Product at a Great price! But for just $29.98, this is not just good, its bloody AMAZING! What in the world are you waiter for, GO BUY THIS DVD PLAYER, RIGHT NOW!
Have had several routers over the years. Signal travels over 65' through several rooms and provides reliable signal no matter how many devices access it. A good value for the price.
This is a small player this is simple and straight forward to use. Cable was long enough to connect easily to the TV hung on the wall above it.
Fantastic!!! Handy little device. Plug it into a USB on your PC and presto...you have four more USBs that you can turn on and off. Love it!!!
I love my GoPro! Its so versatile with all the different mounts and tripod applications and can be controlled by my phone which doubles as a viewfinder! If you don't plan on using it in extreme situations, definitely get a frame case for it because the audio quality with the waterproof case is terrible. You'll be thanking me later when you compare videos with and without the waterproof case.
Battery was a HP direct oem replacement identical to the failed battery. Product shipped on time, tracking information was accurate, received on date promised.
We bought the GoPro Hero 3 White edition for snorkeling in Hawaii. It's not our primary camera, so we didn't want the upgraded editions. We used it for both video and still shooting, and the pictures and video were great - very clear and bright. We were impressed with the f2 lens, which let a lot of light in - some cameras with smaller apertures give a much darker image underwater. The waterproof housing kept everything dry. We were also impressed with the battery life. The menus take a little getting used to, but that's true with any camera we've owned. Note that the camera does not have a screen for seeing what you're shooting, nor for viewing images afterwards - you just have to trust that you're shooting in the right direction, but the wide-angle lens helps a lot. We used this with a Sannysis floating handle, so that the camera would float if we let go of it - definitely a good idea for water use. We definitely recommend this camera!
Very fast router on both bands. A little hard to setup but this is my first dual band. I didn't realize that that means 2 separate networks with their own SSID and key. I have it in a cabinet my tv is sitting on and it runs fairly cool. Huge range and speed. Can't be happier. I don't need to use my WiFi extender any longer. This covers the range I used the extender to make up for my old router.
The instant I hooked up the Notepad X-Slam Cool Master, the air from the fan is keeping my Laptop was heating up like a Oven. I can easily feel the Laptop and notice the difference between the temperature and performance of my Laptop since today. It's only 20 bucks, what do you have to lose? I've had my Laptop for 4 years and this Cool Master just gave my Laptop a second chance of life, and it's like a quiet mouse now. Pick up the Cool Master and you won't regret the decision.
As a music lover and a vinyl collector, this is one of the best record players I have ever owned. Jensen is a reliable brand. The speakers are great for what they are. They are not the loudest, but they get the job done. I recommend getting some bigger speakers if you want to make the neighbors mad. If you listen to rock and guitar wailing records then the pitch adjust is a life saver. All in all I am extremely satisfied with this product. It is a great deal when it comes to the price and the quality.
It''s the only site I can get these pocket radios for my disabled son. Easy for him to manage. K-Mart has these also, but only in limited supply. I know I can go to Amazon and order as many as I want.
After reading some of the revues about this product, I was a little worried about how loud the noise from the fan would be. Not to worry, this is the quietest cooler that I have ever owned. Thankfully, as I'm going to be laid up in the hospital for a couple of weeks and the last thing I would need is a loud laptop cooler. It's easy to connect, works great with Windows 8.1 no extra drivers needed for it. It fits perfectly in the "AmazonBasics 15.6-inch laptop bag". Well worth the money.
I procured my GoPro to use on my paddle board but found so many other uses. The sound capture is really clear with both the skeleton back and the waterproof case. Great to give to children to see the world through their eyes. GoPro has captured some amazing moments with my child that I would have never fathomed capturing without a waterproof case. Stellar buy!
Working the way it should. I am paying for 30mbps. My old router was delivering 11mbps. Hooked up the Archer C7 speed test took me up to 27mbps. Plus, the install was easy. This is the first day of use, however, it is delivering what I expected. I have Fire TV and Roku and those hooked up to the 5 ghz.

I bought this radio for my father, he is used to hearing music while going to sleep. The radio is a perfect size and it streams the radio station clearly.
Worked like a charm. The audio jacks on my laptop stopped working and this adapter allowed me to continue wearing headphones while working on my laptop.
This is the best router I have it is long distance and speed is fast. Very happy with the purchase. If you want something cheaper with smaller wide range I'd say go with tplink wr84n
Bought this as a present for an18- year old great nephew who wanted to "get into vinyl." He loves the turntable and has been taking it with him when with friends. It has been a big hit. As a joke we let him borrow one of my wife's John Denver albums to listen to while he builds his collection. I'm told that this listener of Megadeth, Slipknot, Motley Crüe, etc. has been observed listening to the Denver album multiple times in the last two weeks since receiving the turntable. Got to give him credit for being open and versatile, if not eclectic, with his music tastes.
Super great price and works fantastically! I'd stock up if i were you! I compared the prices of this 2-pack to the prices of the 5-packs or the 2 5-packs and came to the conclusion it was cheaper to just stick with buying the 2-packs! Its a great prices and definitely the cheapest and best option!
I just received my item today shipping was fast. I started using it right away and it is so quiet and my husband told me he wants on too. So I just ordered him one as well and it will be here in a couple of days.
iI wasnt sure how I was going to feel about ChromeOS, being web based and not having traditional applications.. but after using it for a bit, now I am completely satisfied with the purchase. I am a pro photographer, so I was unsure if this would meet my needs, but it is able to handle 98% of what I need a laptop to do (obviously my editing will always be desktop based). Super light, perfect size, beautiful screen, great style.. perfect for client meetings or dumping cards while on a shoot (sd reader and usb3 help in that regard). It boots in seconds, literally takes more time to type my password than start up. Awesome little machine, and for $300, its a no brainer, esp if you are already utilizing google products. Honestly, I like it quite a bit more than my previous macbook pro for my laptop needs.
Works great and made well. Love the extra port on top of the USB plug and the way you can hide the wires with the built in groves made for that purpose. And you definitely get more bang for your buck.
With the latest OS update from Amazon now available, the most glaring issues with this phone has been fixed. This new fork of the 2014 Android KitKat OS is a major improvement over the 2012 version of android (4.1) previously installed on the Fire phone. If you are hesitating to buy one due to it having such an old version of android installed, the new update is available for manual install (check XDA forums) or wait a few days for the OTA update to be released here in the States.
I really like the phone it was so easy to set up. Straight Talk works very well. I really received the phone in a very timely Manner.Thank you Amazon It really is a pleasure doing business with you.
I love this thing. I've used Mac computers for the last few years, but this does everything I need for a fraction of the cost. The speakers are great for watching a movie on Netflix. My only complaint is that I can't plug my iPhone into it to dump pictures. Totally worth the money!
This was perfect! I got it super fast, and the Fujifilm film works perfectly fine with my Polaroid 300! It's exactly the same as Polaroid film, but cheaper! I'm so happy I found this!!!!! :DDDDD
Its quiet, reliable and cooler then many of the other pads i've used before. My gaming laptop runs about 10C cooler then it ran without it. Its also very thin and no the least bit uncomfortable.
Works great on my Windows 10 laptop. The last set of updates killed my built-in Realtek (ALC-272) so it's been a few weeks with no audio. I just plugged this one in and it works great. Immediate sound again.
I bought it because the price was less than from Staples and HP. I wasn't sure it was an original battery as claimed, but having received and installed it, it's as good as the battery that came with the computer when originally purchased.
This was a great purchase. The film is much cheaper to order from this seller than to buy from Urban Outfitters which is what I usually do. Seller shipped promptly and everything was great.
Very happy with this purchase! I asked around a few before actually making my order but knew I wanted one in this price range. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed! The device plays excellent. The pitch adjustment knob is a great thing to have and helps me hear the records more clearly. If you're playing your music more personally this is a great one because the volume goes up to a low roar but can't be heard from more than a few rooms away at its highest. Personally how I enjoy it! As all the other reviews will say, its great to have a pair of external speakers for this one and I agree because it definitely won't be the life of any party on its own. Also the tone adjustment knob doesn't have an indicator of how high or low I'm turning it so I usually just don't use it. I honestly couldn't even tell you if mine works because I don't ever hear a difference when I try. Includes the adjustment piece to play 45 records as well so that won't be a problem. Also, if you're planning to copy your music from vinyl to digital, everything is included but very time consuming if you want all of your songs as separate audio files. Overall, great for any first turntable!
Enjoyed the product. Came sooner than expected and was in great condition; as it stated in the discription. I would recommend this product/buyer to anyone
I have a rather large laptop and for the past months I've had this it has worked quite well. Previously I had some tiny external fan which would constantly struggle and become jammed for whatever reason but this one has none of those issues. The fan is large enough and there is enough protection around it to prevent any dust from really interfering with its functionality. The blue light is neat but honestly I can barely see it even in the dark since it is placed under with the fan none the less it is a nice touch. If you can afford this fan I think it is worth it considering it should last pretty long.
Setup was simple. We have a small apartment so range isn't a problem. We have 100mb/s internet and we get 100mb/s + on our wireless speed. And when transferring files across the network over Wireless AC the speeds are phenomenal
Purchased this bc I did not want to deal with windows...broken windows. I am an Apple fan, own an iPhone 6 previously had 5 and recently sold a Mac Mini(purchased on Amazon) sold for a good price, I wanted a Macbook but common sense told me not to spend the $1400 for it. Having almost completely given up the notion to buy a computer and keep using my phone to search the web-I saw something about Google Chrome and felt compelled to research it. Turned out, it was rated highly(top 10) so, I decided to buy...and I love it!!! No, it does not have all the bells and whistles of the MB-BUT FOR THE PRICE, IT'S WAY BETTER THAN ANYTHING WITH WINDOWS OS!!!! There are plenty of links on Google to make it your own and it does not break your budget! Give it a try if you are open to something different, I don't think you will regret it!
This is a fantastic device. It's very small, but works quite well. It's extremely durable; where my last one broke within a month, the plug on this one doesn't even wiggle a little. The only complaint I have is that the volume is extremely high and, were it not for my headphone audio control, I'd have to keep it on 2 (on Windows 8.1) just to avoid ear pain. The quality is very good, however, and I still highly recommend it.
I just finished converting 62 old record albums to digital using this turntable. The albums were from the 50's and 60's. Some were stereo and some were Hi-Fi. One was from 1946 and was a series of eight 78 rpm records. The turntable worked flawlessly and it was easy. I recorded them into Audacity (Free) and cleaned then up removing clicks and pops and other sound problems. The end quality was better than the original albums. Admittedly I didn't require perfection but if I wanted that I should have bought a high dollar unit and spent much more time on it.
Well it works with my newly acquired iPhone 6. I use this adapter in conjunction with my PIE auxilary input adapter that's plugged into the factory radio in my car. It works like a charm. It charges and sends the audio signals to my radio like a BAUCE. Well worth the money so far. If something happens to it later on. I'll be sure to let yall know about it it fails.
All-in-all, this laptop is a joy to use, and a breath of fresh air from my past laptop experiences. I have spent $700 on a laptop, and that didn't hold a candle compared to this $330 beauty ($299 at the time of this writing). Between its lightweight body, beautiful screen, great speakers, and Chrome OS, I'm not sure I'll be able to find something in the same price area to compete with thi.Read more of my thoughts here: http://wp.me/p4niR7-jp
I'm using this for my HP laptop, I took someone's advice and put in the battery, I had about 40% charge, I waited until the battery drained out all the way in order to get it fully charged the first time. Well it took nearly 2 days for it to completely shut down, I didn't really use the laptop but goodness it took two days for it to actually shut off by itself LOL! I feel like this is a good buy, thanks! Also it has been working great as far as keeping charge, staying on, it's doing it's job!
Awesome! Router. I have Open-WRT installed on it and it runs beautifully. Wired connection I'm getting 66Mbps download speed. Wireless speeds are great though I do not use much. Copper rules! For under a $100 this is an Awesome deal.
This hub is great - I love the buttons which let me disconnect items easily. I have a RAID drive that my computer won't boot up with while connected (whether directly or through any hub) so this hub is exactly what I needed to easily disable the drive while booting so I don't have to constantly plug in/unplug the drive. It has a nice sturdy feel and while not the most beautiful computer accessory ever, it looks nice enough that I can leave it sitting out without cringing when I look at it.
Great phone,I love it and for 189.00 unlocked wow,Buy it,it's awesome loaded with features no other phone has and a free year of prime,Grab it now.
Keeps my laptop cool and it's very lightweight. It also keep my lap cool -- which can be good or not so good depending on how warm blooded you are. You can always turn the fan off.
This is a very very nice Ipad. The price was excellent. The Ipad came brand new, in the original box, and was very easy to set up. Only took five minutes to set up, and was already charged!... I originally purchased one for my 4 year old son, but then thought to buy myself the same model. I have been finding this online for $250 brand new, and it is worth it!!! I believe it's the iPad mini that is the first version [the version that came out in 2012 perhaps?]. It still receives all the updates and fit's very nicely inside my purse.
Better than expected. The absolute right price to use for those garage-sale favorites. Probably not for the collector who rarely plays the records, then has to take extraordinary care when they do. It is for those of us who love and play vinyl. And the bonus is the conversion to MP3 if you want. If you are going to be a purist, just think 60;s shelf components. Looks just like the changer with the dust cover lid, but no need to get the amp and the speakers.
No sure if it's truly an upgrade over my last router because my chromecast is still a tad laggy but I think the signal range is definitely better. All in all for the price, it does an awesome job.
This speaker is pure awesomeness! The bass and sound from it is so good and I didn't think it can get loud, boy was I wrong. This thing operates solely on wifi connection so if you don't have wifi this is useless for you. It takes less than 3 minutes to set it up and after the set up you can select from a wide selection of radios or apps to stream music from. Overall pretty good buy from sonos.
While the price was high, it got the job done. This cable has let me continue to use my phone in my car via a fm modulator after I updated phones from a 30 pin to a lighting cable.
I absolutely love this record player. The sound is good, it could be a little louder but i am not complaining. You can just buy speakers to plug it into. My only complain is that when i opened it out of the box, i found little traces of this white powder all over the record player, even on the table area where the disc sits, which is not very appealing when i first open the box. But no damage from the powder, I'm listening to a record now and it sounds great. Overall this is a great buy for the price!
Perfect! I purchased this radio for my dog to have on while I am away at work. It was a great alternative to leaving the tv on all day. He seems much happier and I am happier that it is battery operated and saves on power. :) Sound quality is great...even without having the antenna up. I highly recommend.
An amazingly powerful device that is simply amazing to look at. So convenient when I'm out and about.Once you learn the ChromeOS ecosystem its all plain sailing. Hasn't yet missed a beat and every day I learn more efficiency tweaks. Superb value as well. A big thumbs up to Toshiba and Google, I am now a convert.
I usually never write reviews but I had to this time. This camera works amazing and I don't regret purchasing this. It worked perfectly up until it had sound issues so I called GoPro and they had horrible customer service and wouldnt do anything for me. So I called amazon because i didn't know what else to do and Amazons customer service is THE BEST. The sent me a brand new one next day even though it was two months old and not in the 30 day period. They give you a shipping label and all you have to do is send it back within 30 days. Anyway this go pro has amazing quality and with numerous mounts this is the way to go to record any action sport you may do.
I really liked this Chromebook. It is perfect for what I use a laptop for. I may have to downgrade this rating though depending just how well Toshiba stands behind their product. The other day I came home from work, opened up the Chromebook and when the video started the screen was all dark with red, pink and green lines running through it. It never did come on and the screen got very hot in the center at the bottom. I've only had this thing for 3 months and it's never been abused and is still in "like new" condition. Initial calls to Toshiba did not sound promising. After I explained the issue I was having the very first thing out of the representatives mouth was "Well, that probably won't be covered by your warranty!" They stopped short of dashing my hopes completely but I certainly do not have a warm, fuzzy feeling at this point. So right now I am torn between a great little Chromebook that could turn into a bad memory.
This speaker and it's functionality is awesome. After making some simple settings, it comes on each morning playing the music want to hear. I can adjust and or change songs using my phone or tablet and it sounds great. Although it's not cheap, it's awesome.
iI have a buddy who has an older Hero2 and the latest Hero3+ Black Edition. After talking to him and looking at a bunch of his videos from each, I decided on the Hero3 White Edition based on what features I wanted. To me there was no question about the quality or reliability, these things are great for years. I wanted the ability to get HD 1080p vids at 30fps, but didn't have a reason to get the 60fps or the higher-res formats available in the Hero3+ Black. Those really are great features if you need them, the video quality is amazing, but wasn't necessary for me personally. One thing I learned about the White edition that i got is it has the ability to link to my iPhone (and other phones I'm sure but check the specs) and review videos or watch a live feed from the camera with only a few second delay, via a wifi connection using the GoPro app. I can also use the phone as a remote control for starting and stopping recording too, which for me makes having a separate remote unnecessary. Mine came with both the watertight enclosure and the skeleton back if you want clearer sound and don't need the protection. I wish GoPro included a little bit of memory with the package, you can't record without it. Separately I bought a 32GB Ultra Micro SDHC card, gives me more recording capacity than I need, many hours.
Outstanding cooler. Using for about a month now. No problems. Love the 160mm fan. Really pushes some air. For less than 20.00 bucks on sale you can't beat it. Very silent too. The piggy back USB is a plus. Made well. Very sturdy..
Way quieter than my previous Targus Chill pad which I needed to replace because the cable kept making the connect/disconnect noise on windows.It supports my 17.3" HP laptop well. 420/10 would bang and buy again.
I bought this item because I've wanted a record player for such a long time. I searched for different brands and kinds and read reviews that said "not good tone, not good pitch" but I didn't care for something that was high-tech and had so many different buttons, I wanted something that would simply play records. This is perfect. It's easy to handle, it's light, I can understand how to work it (I know nothing about record players). Apparently it plays 3 different size records (33, 78, 45) so you just flip a switch when you have a different sized records. It's really neat and I love having it.
I previously got the stick and I like it so much that I gave it to my mother. Then I miss it and got this one. The only difference is that this one got games, but I got it for the headphones
So far I love this battery! I was skeptical before I purchased it, but I'm glad that I did. My battery was manufactured on 02/14 and it works great. I'm super happy that I no longer have to be glued to an outlet! The battery life so far is just about what my original battery life was (about 2.5 hours) so I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. It's only been about a week so I will update my review if anything changes.
Why did I not buy this before?! I have killed far too many headphones and ear buds because of how my hand rests when I'm writing. The only better solution would be if it was flat.
This is the best cooling pad for my laptop because it has not broken down at all and I have been using this product for a long time! It cools my laptop and the fan works great! I am happy with this product!!
Does it sound awesome? No. Will it last forever? No. Does it do what t says it will? Yes. Was it less than $50? Yes. Would I buy it again? Yes. This is exactly what you would expect a $50 plastic record player to be. The cool thing is it does what it says it will and my youngest daughter loves it! I haven't tried converting any of my old albums yet but my daughter has and says it worked just fine. It all boils down to who you're buying it for and what you want it to do. Obviously this is not for the audiophile. But for a lot of people, this is a great little turntable and you can't beat the price!
Works perfectly and my computer even recognizes each as separate ports. Has showed no sign of bogging down my laptop even when i have multiple running at the same time. The on/off switches are great too
I really like this. Makes it easy to switch between devices without having to access the back of my CPU, and I like that I can easily turn devices on and off as well. The blue backlighting is also a neat touch. One pleasant unexpected result .. my Logitech Wireless Mouse used to frequently freeze up before when it was plugged directly into my CPU, but has performed flawlessly since I attached it through this hub. Go figure.
Excellent radio. I have little experience with replacing electronics and this was far easier than i thought it would be. It works great and if it works so well with my '91 chevy s10 itll work with anybody.
Impulse buy...now I will never go without one. Works perfectly. I guess the newer ones already have the firmware updated because mine had no paper saying to update it first, like I saw on some video reviews. The video is surprisingly steady when mounted to my motorcycle for track day sessions. On the street, only the worst bumps upset the footage. I was worried about getting just the "white" version. I couldn't be happier. FYI, get the GoPro App from google play for your smartphone, it makes the whole thing that much better. You can position your GoPro to frame exactly what you want to film with total ease. It's the perfect remote. I don't even use the menu on the camera, I just use my phone. You can aim the camera, view in real time, change resolution, watch, delete or share clips. Just about everything your GoPro can do, you can control from your phone. Now I have mounts on all of my motorcycles, mountain bike, car, helmets, everwhere. Drives my wife crazy :-) Too many clips of my nine year old to count.
I was glad to find a new battery for my laptop. It was very affordable for a brand new one. Now I know where to look in the future for some things that I might need. Thanks Amazon.com
Put this radio in a golf cart. Just the right size, tho the sound isn't loud enough... that could be the fault of the speakers we used however
Great range, easy setup. People need to start thinking of their router as an appliance, and the one you use the most. An incredible value for the price.
I love this turntable. It was priced super reasonable and it works great. I almost passed on it because I read reviews about the built in speakers being tinny. I am convinced that those reviews are from people that never listened to records on turntables in the 70s. This thing is awesome. It is almost disappointing that it automatically eliminates a lot of the natural record/needle noise. The music coming out of the internal speakers is high quality, I can't imagine out of a Bose or even into a regular stereo. I'm a very satisfied owner of this product that is loving listening to his albums after 30 plus years. I purchased the turntable to convert all of my albums to digital and this is the ticket. The software that comes with it will let you do way more than I am even capable of understanding, but if you just want to convert your albums to digital or even just listen to them again, this is a no brainer.
After reading the reviews I carefully reviwed my order making sure Amazon matched me with the MINI 7 film and they did. I am usually reallt good at checking my orders but make sure you READ all the item description and the packaging! But YES it is the right film and works perfect in the Mini camerea!
OEM HP battery at a very low price. Works just as good as the one supplied with new computer. Allows me to keep working on the computer during long trips where charging is not possible.
Best phone I have had so far... the exclusive content and fetures from amazon make it the awesome... Not to mention how easy it is to download google play to get endels apps....
Fast delivery. Unit has been working great! It is being used in a bedroom on a separate floor from the router, and still streams without any buffering or hesitation whatsoever! Def happy with my purchase AND this seller. Thank you!!
Works great! Perfect for travel! I use it when I go fishing. Was worried it would be tough to tune because it is a dial and not digital but tunes in great! Can be quiet but also can be VERY loud that it actually modulates the sound. I would recommend this to everyone!
Quite simply, the most useful piece of computer technology I have so far owned.Was expecting it to be an online-only tool, except for email and documents etc but pleasantly surprised by the number and power of apps that can also be used offline e.g.wevideo for video editing.If I had the budget, I would buy the Google Pixel version for the physical build in metal- but the Tosh CB35 HD version is all I need
I had bought this for my boyfriend for christmas, and he absolutely loves it. He can hook it up to an app on his phone. and it works really well, and has good quality.
I use one of these on tablets and laptops with no microphone ports to record drums. It's never let me down. Plug and play.
Bought this for my mother in a nursing home....small and lightweight. It's a Sony....so it's great quality. Exactly what she needed. Great DVD player for the price. I would recommend for a Camper or Dorm perhaps. Excellent product----highly recommend.
I'm giving it 5 stars and I am glad I chose this record player over others available. It is a lot of fun too! High quality build. I have only one CON to list. The 45 rpm adapter does not stay put in it's storage well during transport. It could be easily lost if not careful. I had more luck leaving the adapter on the turntable while transporting it form one place to another. Quality and operational wise it deserves 5 stars. Over all well done Jensen! Recommended.
I use this iPad for class and it is perfect for throwing into my book bag and taking notes on during class. The size makes it easy to carry and bring everywhere
The Hero3 is an excellent choice in value between the other options available today. The video quality this camera records is superb. The newer models do have better options for frame rate and even 4K video but the average user honestly doesn't need all these options. This model has the ability to transmit to the GoPro cellphone app directly from the camera via a secure Wi-Fi connection. I found this option to be incredibly useful when capturing and checking video's while away from a computer. This feature is a necessity. The biggest gripe i have about the camera is the poor battery life. Purchasing an extra battery and/or the battery backpack is a must.
I was truly blown away!!! Bluetooth, 3 FM programable bands, USB and SD card slot - All I can say is "WOW" this thing installed like a dream, easy to wire, and sounds great...I'm still waiting for the bill to come in the mail saying I owe another $100 bucks - LOL - really what a deal for only $25.00 XO Vision you really RoCK!!! - thanks so much for an amazing product -
After reading the other reviews I decided to go with this radio and was not disappointed. It gets good reception, nice and compact and is perfect for my needs.
made my surface my computer after I broke the screen works great I have the Anker® 2.4G Portable Wireless Mouse connected too it and the logitek keboard I got from amazon too
I like many other people searched until my fingers flew off researching the Chromebook field. A little background. I initially had two Chromebooks (11.6 Samsung and 14 HP) just after they were released and at that time I really enjoyed them but felt that I probably needed something bigger. I invested in a 13" Macbook Pro and am very happy with it however... like most average consumers I do 90% or more of my computing using a browser. The other 10% is done on my Macbook Pro and really that's only to edit photos (and I can do that just as well with a browser based app). I now store my photos on a personal external HDD and up in the cloud, this makes sharing so much easier. My new Samsung 2 arrived. Un-boxed and plugged in for 30 minutes and battery was full charge. Opened it up and WOW! This display is awesome. Very bright and colorful. This HD IPS display is really something else. My previous ones were the normal dull low resolution models which were fine but this one stands out. Yes it looks like my Macbook Pro and you know I think it manages the web faster! The keyboard is solid and very easy to get used to The track pad is find but has a bit of a rough surface (it's not glass) but responds just fine. This Chromebook looks great, is light weight, quite solid for being a plastic body, the sound is above average and the web camera can take a decent photo. For a 13" Chromebook this one rocks. It looks and feels even better then my Mac. I'm very happy and excited to be back in the Chromebook seat again. I'll keep the Macbook because it has an optical drive so I can copy our old VHSc tapes to disc. By the way, I've been on this all evening and the battery is still at 86%. I'm glad to be back with a Chromebook and I'm very happy with this Toshiba!
Love it! Does not eat up batteries! I have been using it in the bathroom while taking a shower. I have not changed the batteries since November and I have been using it everyday. Picks up signal even if there is no window in bathroom. Sound is loud enough even if shower is running.
Thanks to Amazon Prime, I received my DVD player on Sunday, just as promised! Took no time to set up and starting playing my movies immediately and it was great! The Phillips DVD player I purchased at Walmart didn't make it one week! I am confident, this one is going to do better, so far so very good!
I gave this five stars because I got exactly what I expected - five packs of Instax Mini film for $38.12. Upon further research, I realized it's much less expensive to buy the double packs ($13.40 each). If you buy three double packs of film for $13.40 each it's only $40.20 and it's still available on Amazon Prime so shipping is free. That's definitely what I'll be doing next time.
I bought these for my students to make documentaries. They are hardy, easy to use, and very kid-friendly. Like any new "toy" the fun is with exploring and learning how it works…this was a fun and exciting process for me and my students. Battery life is more than adequate…especially combined with a back-up battery and charger. Using the GoPro Studio software, the class is making some pretty cool documentaries. There are other cams available for such projects, but I wanted a cam that could handle extensive kid use, and was easy to use…the GoPro works!
I don't understand all of the negative reviews about this phone. I love it. I own an iphone 5 and a samsung galaxy phone. The fire phone is my go to phone. Yes, I side loaded some of the apps that were not available in the amazon app store but so what. The phone runs flawlessly and it is quick. I would buy it again
My HP's battery stopped holding a charge almost exactly 18 months after I bought the laptop, and I bought this to replace it. It's been about 10 months since I bought it and it's going strong. I'll probably have to buy another one in a year or so.
Price point is really high, but this cable enabled me to hook my iphone 5s to my car stereo, where it transmits audio in addition to charging. The extra bit of length helps too.
The screen images are crisp and it does everything I need at a bargain price. It obviously not an Apple laptop but I don't need or want one of those. You are limited with the cloud based system but if your needs do not exdeed your limits then it really doesn't matter. This machine is plenty fast and very convenient. Battery life seems more than adequate.
I'm a stay at home mother and if the tv is on during the day its almost always cartoons. By the time my husband would home and my LO was in bed I didn't get a chance to relax and watch what I wanted to watch on tv. I mainly just watch tv shows so decided to buy this instead of installing another att box that wouldn't get used a whole lot. I LOVE MY ROKU!!!! I get to watch WHAT I want WHEN I want and can even fast-forward or rewind which I cant do with a tv provider.
This cable does the job. I've used other adapters that are not as well constructed, hello electrical problems, in various other issues. This cable, comes from Apple, has great build quality, and work perfectly for my application. I use this to adapt an old system in my car to my iPhone and my iPad. It worked out-of-the-box with no questions, And I'm glad I spent the extra money as it's directly solved my connection problem in the best way possible. I would highly recommend going this route rather than a cheaper one. I bought many dozens of cables, and For this application, based on other reviews of other cables etc., I thought this was the best solution. Now that I have I'm convinced it is.
Worked perfectly, albeit very expensive for what it is. Necessary to get audio functionality adapted to older Iphone inputs. Don't try the cheap China made knock-offs; most likely won't work eventhough they look the same.
I bought this Fujifilm Instax Mini Instant Film, 10 Sheets (5-Pack) for my new Fuji instant camera and the pics have good quality.
Works perfectly adapting my Sony sound system with older iPhone 30 pin connector to my new iPhone 6. Charges and plays music at the same time. I wish it came in black too...
Cheapest film. Price was cheaper than bhphotovideo! Shipping free too! Expiration date was over a year away. Buy in bulk for massive savings! Thanks amazon!
This replaced a built in DVD player that was in a 19" television set. I used it to entertain my kitties while I work, and was sad when the player quit working. This was a great price, and once I figured out how to get it going with the set, my kitties were so happy to see their movies again! It's a nice player that I can also use to watch movies on my large set, so it will get used a lot!
It works, asking nothing more. Have not run benchmarks, but it works. Was there something else. Oh, yes, it works and no complaints. Nuff said.
Wonderful. Easy to set up. More fun if you have Sonos speakers in multiple rooms -- sometimes I walk through the house with all of the speakers grouped and it sounds awesome.
My battery was so bad that as soon as I disconnected it from a power source, my computer would die. This is just like the original battery, and it works perfectly. I've had it for about three months now, and it works great.
Working very well so far. I like to have the on-off buttons for each individual outlet, so I can mount and demount a hard drive without unplugging. Most hard drives nowadays don't have on-off buttons; but when a hard drive in mounted to the computer, even when it's not being used, the computer will ramp it up and down on a regular basis, which adds unnecessary wear and tear, and can be noisy with some drives
it was so good to get a radio back in the car that was not AM. My mood got better once FM was back. AM radio is just to depressing.Was easy to put in, a little light weigt but good sound and performance.
Perfect petite size for my instax mini 8! Love clipping them onto my lights with little clothespins :) came quickly & even was able to to be bundled with my camera. Will definitely buy more!
I bought this to connect an Iphone 6plus to my old Bose sound dock. It works perfectly for this, although I wish the cable could be a little bit longer.
Good morning just want to write a quick review about this for aunt and uncle and they enjoyed it immensely thank you for having such reasonably priced items
I bought this because I was having trouble getting Windows to recognize my speakers. No problem with this device. I use it on Windows and Linux with no problem. Highly recommended.
Quite pleased with this Sony AM/FM radio. The good audio for me especially while listening and doing chores around the yard outside. Happy with the reception as I'm typically listening to baseball games.
it's just extra slots. ..wish the manufacturers would attach a cord that swivels or adjusts so it will sit flat matter what position it's in..
I love this speaker! If you already have a Sonos system, this is great for any room you don't already have a speaker for. Since it's portable, you can unplug it and move it to anywhere you want to enjoy your system. The sound is awesome and you can turn it up loud enough to fill any room (and nice base!). And just so you know, this is not a fake review. I'm an Amazonoholic and read a ton of reviews on everything I purchase and I can clearly tell when I read one that was planted. This speaker is worth every penny I spent on it, not to mention from box to music was no more than 5 minutes! If you've been thinking about getting one, go ahead and pull the trigger, this thing jams!
I had been looking for a new phone since I was very unhappy with my Nokia, I had always liked Samsung but they were priced to high so I checked into the fire phone again and the reviews were much better than when it first came out, and I am a fan of the kindle, and the price was right for the unlocked version along with a year of prime. I wasn`t sure what I would think but it had to be better than what I had, I liked alright right away but as I got used to it I started really liking how it worked and really started to wonder why it had the bad reviews, but I understand it just happens to work great on everything I want in a phone, I`ve had it for about two months now and it`s by far the best phone I`ve ever used, and its got plenty of storage, and had played every format of video I put on it, and at this point it`s hard to find anything bad about it, the battery could last longer but that`s not a big problem. It will take a little time to get used to it, but once you do its easier and more handy to use than any other phone I`ve used,
Love love love. I was super concerned about upgrading to the iphone 6 and not being able to use it in my car. Works perfect in my 2010 Nissan Sentra
Arrived quickly and fit and worked perfectly. A lot cheaper than other sites. Ordering was easy as I could look at the photo to make sure it matched up.
I bought it for my mom so she can listen her old records, and I swear to God that I've never seen her so excited with a present. it was definetly a good choise.It works very good. Good sound and volume. perfect size
$189-$99 (Prime Membership) = $90 Kindle. 13 mp camera, great display, solid build quality. Dynamic Perspective is extremely unique & compelling. Auto Scroll alone is worth the price of admission
A great deal for a nice "compact" DVD/CD player. I enjoy being able to watch movies and my own room and not wait in line for the dvd player in the living room after both the kids.
For Playstation 3 users: If you connect your headset to it then you should be able to use it for gaming. Tested it out a few hours ago when I got it and it worked like a charm for me (I'm not going to guarantee that it'll work for you but it worked for me).
This is the best way to beat the cable companies, the channels are endless, one can link it up with Amazon, Netflix...and others....no more cable bills, excellent clarity on pictures.....totally a good deal.
This is a great little radio. I like to listen to AM radio and it has been hard to find something with good reception; but this radio is excellent. And it's small enough that I can take it with me when I exercise. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
This is a great little inexpensive stereo. I needed something for an older pick-up I seldom use. The radio works great, and the lack of a CD unit was fine as I have my music on USB thumb drives and SD cards, which is WAY more useful. If one does not need super loud "Boom Box" sound or Sat-Nav/Blu-Tooth, this is an excellent choice. And for seldom used or older vehicles, it will give you outstanding entertainment that is easy (and affordable) to replace if stolen.
I run a business and do most of my work in browsers so I thought I'd try a chromebook. I also run a podcast. I've had it for about 5 days and I have to say I love it. I've recorded a couple podcast episodes already and it went well. It's super fast. I always have many tabs open to do online marketing so I didn't want it to get slowed down. The battery lasts all day. The keyboard feels good too. The screen quality is awesome and there is a noticable difference with the speakers. I love it!
this DVD player came in good time and was shipped in good condition. The set up was easy and it worked with our previous cords. the instructions were easy and it works wonderfully. I like the ease with loading and unloading. I am happy that we chose this machine. Just good reception and all around ease of handling.
It works and you can turn on and off each port. It works on my 360 for the wireless adapter (I have first gen) and play and charge and kinect. I would buy again.
had to get this coz my old macbook just isnt operatioal anymore.love its functionality and quality . good job toshiba ! . so glad i got this for my junior high daughter. great display and texts might be small at first, u can easily adjust them. perfect for web browsing the net than a tablet or phone. so user friendly. chrome ios is legit. i cant wait til they come out with a CB3 and a 15 inch chromebook. also, for a case, i highly reccomend this : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QFS1EFG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 by nuvur
My battery was so bad that as soon as I disconnected it from a power source, my computer would die. This is just like the original battery, and it works perfectly. I've had it for about three months now, and it works great.
Great sound, very loud. I am very impressed with this unit. I took a chance and ordered it and it does everything it should. I installed it in my boat and am very pleased with it.
Bought this to replace an old g-router. Better than I anticipated. Set-up was simple, and connection/speeds are EXCELLENT. I'm getting better than 130mps downstairs with the router upstairs behind a computer. Haven't had dropped connections like it constantly did with my old g-router. Love the dual 2.4/5 GHz bands.
I purchased this one for my mom. I have one for myself. It is a great little radio that boosts some good sounds. The dial is very easy to use for anyone. I bought it for my mom because it is simple and does not need any manual reading. Put batteries in and go! Whatever your level of expertise, it is a great radio to have around the house or to bring with you.
This is an apple product, just as described! I bought it to use with my docking station that is older and I wanted one that I didn't have the take the phone case off. This product worked perfect!
Awesome!!! Works peeled early to extend my Mini Coopers Y Cable. I also needed something with a thinner tip so i can charge my phone with my case on. Highly recommend this product.
Great little AM/FM portable radio that uses penlight (AA) batteries which seem to last a very long time. I have several of these for trips and camping. You do need to extend the whip antenna for weaker FM stations. The tuning LED is a big help
It's actually better than I expected. The camera is very "forgiving" of light and distance changes. I really didn't expect the focus to be as good as it is since it's a fixed focus camera. If you get one, go ahead and get a few accessories, like suction cup mount and either a handle bar mount or roll bar mount. My only complaint is that they didn't have these when I was a lot younger!
This is a great unit for the money . It took one hour to install and that was because it had a deferent connector then the old one . Came with correct bracket . Plugged in my SD card with all my all my music , about 40 CDs. It sounds Great and controls are easy . Came on time .
very good works great, it is very small so read the dimensions. i love the remote, you can skip chapters, and fast forward.
This is by far the best investment I ever made. After years of paying over $100 for cable. Watching the same things everyday. Paying for a bunch of channels I never watch. I am so glad I was told about this. I'm addicted!! With so many options I want to stay in bed all day just watching my roku
I have a 2000 Ford Ranger I just installed this radio myself and I was a little bit skittish on how it would sound because all of you people on here are bad mouthing it but it is one of the best sounding stereos I've had and it was cheap I like it five stars
We are a Sonos family for sure---and we purchased two of these SONOS PLAY:1s to combine with the Sonos sound bar to have a surround sound experience when we watch TV. Works great--we placed them on each side of us just behind the sofa. Very pleased. Excellent quality. Sonos has never disappointed us yet! We will continue to purchase their products.
boosted my signal a lot I get better internet and faster do not spend money on anything more this his rated in the top 5 in the country
Now, I'll admit that I was really, REALLY avoiding paying for this adapter, but I'm so glad that I sucked it up and did it. I went through a series of cheaper options, and was disappointed each and every time since none of them worked. However, once I got this product, I could immediately notice the difference in quality, and it worked perfectly. Save yourself the trouble and heartache. Just buy the real thing. Good luck, guys!
I was completely blown away by this hotel. It was magnificent. I got a great deal and I am so happy that I stayed here. Before arriving I was nervous as I had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay, for example very noisy. However, whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant, it made no difference to me. My room was huge, bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure, bed was perfect and the view was amazing. Hotel is so close to the great shops of Magnificent Mile, plus a comfortable walking distance to Hancock tower and Millennium Park. 
We've just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Chicago and our visit was delightful. Thanks to tripadvisor reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the facade and entrance..it was a mess. And the hotel restaurant and bar remain incomplete and unavailable. Even parts of the lobby had "wet paint" stickers. All these things could have made for a disappointing stay. Not so!! Although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff. After just a few minutes we felt like we were "at home." The suite on the 25th floor, with a fab view along a wall of windows, was sparkling fresh and clean. The bathroom lighting was outstanding and led to my bride of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look younger...she was right! Everything in and about the room was "like-new" and very stylish. As a visitor we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the Magnificient Mile and all of its ambiance. Thanks to a dedicated and gracious staff, a fantastic location, and chic decorating elements, this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in Chicago. The stay was short..but sweet. 
Excellent location, feels like a boutique hotel. Right next to Neiman Marcus (V.expensive dept store) and 2 mins walk to John Hancock tower. As most American ,medium to high end, hotels service was excellent from the bellhop to reception. Upgrade to a suite if you are staying longer than a couple of days as walking around the windy city can be tiring and a suite feels like a small apartment. The pub in the basement is good for a sandwich and a Beer. They will be refurbing so take adavantage of lower rates now as I feel they will be going for very high end clients after the remodelling 
I travel a lot for business and quite frankly, my expectations were starting to reach new lows. I usually always choose W Hotels just for the consistency (of average hotels). The Affinia in Chicago has raised my expectations and W Hotels are going to suffer in comparison. This hotel is one of the cleanest I have stayed at in some time. Service was impeccable. Friendly front-desk staff and the extra towels I ordered arrived literally within minutes. The gym has new equipment with plenty of space. And such a fun vibe - without dark hallways and loud music. I have to thank the other reviewers - their reviews led me to the Affinia and I was so pleased. My new "Chicago Hotel". It will even lead me to try the Manhattan hotels. 
We visited for my 40th birthday. We had never been to Chicago so was not sure where to stay. Found the deal on this hotel from Travelzoo. Great rate, staff was awesome, very helpful and nice, location was great. Enjoyed our stay but still like NYC better. Great, great hotel. Would stay again. 
As others have said, once all the construction works are completed I suspect that the prices this hotel can (legitimately) charge will put it out of our price range. Which will be a pity because it is an excellent hotel, & the location couldn't be better. The room was very spacious, with separate sitting & study areas & a nice bathroom. Only 3 minor points: downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast (coffee & pastries), but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this; the cost of internet - $9.99 - is a bit dear especially when lots of motels now offer it free; there was only powered milk in the rooms, which wasn't that nice. But none of these really spolied a really enjoyable stay. 
I checked in at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago shortly after dinner on Tuesday, I was greeted by very frendly staff from the valet service to front desk. You can tell people were happy at the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised when I got to my room. The room was very well decorated and well thought out. The furniture was in the right location and there was lots of space. Plus it was convenient with lots of power outlets The bedroom and washroom was very clean and I had a great sleep in their very comfortable bed. I was told by front desk i could choose from 6 different pillows, although i did not take advantage of this offer i thought what a great idea. Once in a while you come across hotels with great service, well thought out rooms in a perfect location (right off Magnificent Mile). When visiting Chicago again I will definitely try and stay at Affinia again 
I had a large, roomy, clean 2 bed room with a large bathroom, big minibar snack assortment and was tucked away nicely in the corner so that there was no hall noise. Customer Service here was absolutely incredible, from the doorman to the front desk, to the gentleman who delivered my toothpaste to my room when I requested it. Sure, you get a little outside noise, but it is a big city, that is not unusual! I really enjoyed my stay here and strongly recommend it. 
This was a great hotel right in the heart of the Chicago Loop. Within walking distance to the downtown attractions. Parking is expensive ($50 p/nt) so we parked at a free remote location (recreation drive) since we weren't planning on driving once we checked in. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and clean. 
This hotel was PERFECT for our girls getaway. The decor is fun & refreshing. Loved the roof top bar. Every staff member was friendly & always smiling. The location is perfect for Michigan Ave shopping, the beach, dinner and night life. It was a mile or two from Millenium Station. The concierge recommended a couple places to hang out after dinner and added our names to the guest list (I'm sure they do it all the time but still a nice gesture). 
We stayed 6 pleasent days in this not too big and very friendly hotel. the rooms were spotless comfortable and great view too... also nice view from the roof-bar. The area is pleasant nice and clean, minute walk to magnificant mile, easy to walk around to the lake. friendly stuff, very clean, great warm hotel to stay in. it does not have the "big hotel" factory-like feeling - more like home :) 
My husband & I stayed at the Fitzpatrick in early June 2004 for my birthday-great hotel! Location provides easy walking to Navy Pier, Marshall Field, Michigan Avenue & John Hancock. Room seemed spacious even though its only about 300 sq ft. Lots of room in bathroom; comfortable bed; very quiet, upscale hotel. We would definitely stay here again! 
After reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo, I decided to give this hotel a try. I must say it was a great choice! The location is perfect, just off from N Michigan Ave, walking distance from everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the room was excellent. They gave us a corner room w/a great view. As many have posted, the bed & pillows were very comfortable (I am very picky about that). I slept well every night! The renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit. I highly recommend this hotel. 
Excellent location, about a block from Michigan Ave. and two blocks from Water Tower Place and John Hancock Tower. Beautiful hotel, felt very luxurious and high-class for being a moderate priced hotel. Staff was excellent -- friendly and accommodating. 
Stayed at this hotel with 3 friends or 4 nights. The hotel was clean and tidy, throughout. The Concierge Christopher was excellent and helped as with all our needs, gave us discount vouchers etc. Hotel was in excellent position. 3 blocks from John Hancok Building and more importantly The Cheesecake Factory , Bloomingdales 3 blocks away and the Water Tower Shopping Centre 2 blocks away. We went to the huge I Max cinema which is about ten minutes away. Cant wait to go back to Chicago and The Affinia 
The recently remodeled Affina was amazing - from the 6 choice pillow menu to the stocked "pantry and refrigerator" to the brand name bathroom ammenities. Within walking distance to just about everything you could possibly need, the Affina is a great hotel. The staff was pleasant and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Having never stayed in downtown Chicago before, the Affina over and above exceeded our expectations. Although our trip to Chicago was only for one night, we will consider staying at the Affina again for a future visit. 
We got an outstanding rate by signing up for the hotels' website newsletter. Affinia has a great location just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower. Beware however: parking is expensive in the Gold Coast....$48/night. Right from the start, Victor greeted us and made us feel welcome. Check-in was easy and our room was gorgeous. However, it was a handicapped acessible room and I wanted a tub, so one call to the front desk and we had another room. All rooms have been renovated and they are beautiful, comfortable and well appointed. The rooftop bar is a must-do. The outside patio has heaters and candles, a high table for big groups and little groupings of chairs and sofas to get comfy on and enjoy the views. We didn't sit inside the bar area. Pedro and Quentin were excellent bellmen, and Christopher (concierge) was very helpful. As we left, we shook Victor's hand (he's always there!) and told him we've found our new Chicago hotel! 
The Affinia is virtually the perfect hotel for a visit to Chicago. My wife and I stayed in an upgraded suite. Very large room, that is modern and has all the little touches. The staff was extremely helpful and professional. The location is excellent. The price is a good value for what you get. We simply couldn't find anything to criticize. Highly recommended! 
Have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted. Great Bar (draught Stella and Guinness) which was being upgraded at the end of March when I was last there, good food, lovely staff, large clean rooms, comfortable beds, spot on location for the Golden Mile, Joey's Pizzas next door are fantastic. Ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please. Highly recommended 
Stayed at the Chicago Affinia Dec 10 thru Dec 12 and was very impressed with the staff, the room, and the location. Close to shopping and the pizza place next door was great. Of course, there were many other restaraunts nearby as well. I had a little trouble figuring out the heat, but it was fine once I learned how to set it. They were working on the hotel, so we got a great rate. But the work never bothered us. The room was great, with the walk-in shower in the spacious bathroom a wonderful surprise. I would definately stay here again and would recommend to others. 
I stayed at the Allegro for several days in August 2004 and I would defintely stay again. I had a very large room with a huge bathroom, although the property is a converted theater so the rooms may vary in size and layout. The lobby is comfortable with big sofas and chaise lounges, a nice place to enjoy the simple (2 choices, no munchies) but pleasant wine reception. At night, there is not much going on in the immediate vicinity, other than theater traffic, but it's a short cab ride to Michigan Avenue shopping and River North restaurants. 
I had a great time here! It is centerally located in Chicago so walking around is so easy and pleasent. The staff was amazing and very helpful! Parking was a bit steep, but to be expected. The room was very nice and the bed and linens were very confortable. The yoga mat rental was wonderful as well! Wonderful and relaxing experience overall. 
This is best hotel bargin in Chicago if you are not overly unhappy with a small room. Great hotel just redone by Kimpton. This is a great hotel chain that really provides a the sense of escape and fun to all of their hotels. This is a location just off of LaSalle and next to the Cadillac theater. It has a 4 star resturant which we enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere an amazing Italian meal. The wine list is one of the best in a city of great restaurants. The Kimptons have a social hour 5 to 6 with wine at all of their hotels. You sit in a designer, kind of London circa 1968 couch with a fire place nearby and have that lost art form of relaxation with you fellow guests. They are super animal friendly and provide complete services to your dog if you wish to bring it. The exercise room is great and there is a spa here as well. There are two other Kimptons here but for the money the Allegro is the best value and location. Always consider Kimptons as they never disappoint where ever we have used them. 
I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels, however I have never experienced top service as I did at the Hotel Allegro. Even before my visit, concierge Mark Kraemer advised us on things to see, and booked tickets in advance to Second City. We were welcomed warmly on arrival, and the bellman checked up on us as we came and went from the hotel. All the staff have a personal interest in making your stay a great experience. The hotel is next to City Hall, where I had some business. We had a large quiet room, and used room service-the meal came quickly, and included a a bonus fruit cup. Enjoyed the pasta night (20 dollars for a three course meal) at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful, the main pasta a bit too salty. And that is the only complaint I can make-from start to finish, if you want attentive service, this is the place to be. Thank you, Hotel Allegro, for a great stay. I can't wait to return. 
I stayed at the Allegro in July for 4 nights for a business trip. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great. I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny, but ours was perfectly fine, with funky, fun doors. The decor is a lot of fun. We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise. The front desk staff was very friendly, and before we even made it to the desk, a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival. We were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier. For people who were upset about no free coffee - there's a Dunkin Donuts about a block away. I definitely recommend this hotel! 
The only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other Kimpton hotels. It was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee. The robes were not in the room and it took a long time (hours) but other than that a great place. The concierge was excellent. 
My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in March, 2006. We had a great time! We were upgraded to a suite, and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with Mr. Bubbles, animal print robes, and a luxurious king- sized bed! THe suite was very nice, and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street. It was very boutiquey, and the lobby was lovely. We enjoyed the complementary wine hour. The staff was attentive, and our stay in this Kimpton hotel made our first-time trip to Chicago memorable! We would return here! 
If you're in Chicago and want to stay in The Loop, The Allegro Hotel is perfect for you. It's centrally located, stylish rooms and attentive staff. I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and was very pleased with everything. The bed was very comfy and had plenty of fluffy pillows, large flat screen tv, radio with ipod docking station and bathroom was hip and clean. Everyone that I came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. My last day there, I ordered room service and not only was my meal perfect and delivered on time, the kitchen called to see if everything was alright. I have never had that kind of follow up service. I've stayed at the Palomar in DC, another Kimpton hotel and received exceptional service there too. I will definitely see if Kimpton has a hotel at my next destination. 
We brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time. Small rooms, but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene. Lots of interesting amenities in the room. Convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping. Really loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone. Lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere. Watch out: The concierge (like all concierges at big hotels) will direct you to mediocre, large restaurants where they get kickbacks. We have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago. However, the hotel is often full so book early. 
I loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown Chicago, an older hotel with a great reno (a bit over-the-top design, but still very lovely and charming), clean rooms, and very friendly staff. They're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb Mastiff cross with a gift bag (treats and directions to an off-leash area), and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog's names on it. 
We have stayed here several times and have always found it to be clean with comfortable beds. We were given a choice of breakfast or free cocktails which we thought was a nice touch. Our room was small but adequate. Location was great, close to the L trains and also close to the train station as we always "walk" from Union Station. 
I stayed here for 2 nights in May 2008. I have to say the hotel was exceptionally clean and very modern and funky. They had a free wine tasting each evening! The restaurant served very good breakfasts and the staff were lovely and helpful throughout the stay. The hotel is located within walking distance to the metro system and also close to shopping / restaurants and sights! Rooms were lovely, althou the bathroom was slightly on the compact side. Will be back. 
Booked via Priceline.com for a weekend getaway and got the room for $75 per night. When we arrived via Midway we took the Orange Line to within a block of the hotel for just $2. Hotel easy to find. Never felt uncomfortable with the neighborhood/area. Saw very few homeless or panhandlers. Walked all over the place. Great location and hotel is about a $5-$6 cab ride from most major attractions/shopping/restaurants. Hotel is almost gawdy with colors/decor, but it's not that different from a cruise ship decor. It was not annoying decor by any means. Check in was painless and the service was great! Heard NO noise whatsoever...the reports of "thin walls" are greatly exaggerated. The walls are all concrete and thick...we heard NOTHING both nights we were there! Highly recommend this hotel! Rooms are small but not crowded for two people...they are old style hotel rooms..very classic 
A very nice hotel with small but adequate rooms. The decor was lovely. My daughter and I spent 5-nights here, saw Wicked just down the street and used the public transportation to get all around town. Was a bit disappointed with the bar/restaurant which opened and closed it's kitchen at will without regard to posted hours. The room description boasted of safe's large enough to accomodate a laptop, so I brought mine. I was informed after check-in that the safes are not in every room (and not in mine). As a side note, I was surprised that nearly all the shops many restaurants closed at 6pm in that area... even the 7-11. 
I was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the Hotel Allegro. However, our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. The room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another. The bathroom was small but well appointed. Overall, it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased. Others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway. One other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and I can't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe. The area is also very close to public transportation (we used the trains exclusively) and got around quite well without a car. We would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others. 
I've stayed at the Allegro a couple of times. Like the other Kimpton properties, it's a classic old hotel that's been beautifully updated. I found the staff to be cordial, and I really like their corporate culture. They're pet-friendly (although I wasn't travelling with the dog), I got a recycling bin in my room, Aveda products in the bath and they don't clean with toxic chemicals. The rooms aren't huge and the bathrooms aren't what you're going to get at a Hilton. What the Allegro lacks in square footage it more than makes up for in cool. OK, they may be a little pricey, but I'm willing to pay a bit more considering the higher cost of doing business responsibily. 
We stayed in a king suite at the Hotel Allegro over Memorial Day weekend. We paid $130/night, and it was definitely a bargain. The suite was huge - living room with a couch, two chairs, desk; large bathroom; bedroom; two closets. The room had recently been renovated, and was very clean. Comfortable bed, friendly staff, great location (near the train and bus), evening wine reception and morning coffee provided. While the Allegro isn't a five-star hotel, it is a great place for the money. (Note: a friend stayed in a non-suite room, and reported that it was very small. Upgrade if possible). 
Very friendly staff - and helpfull with whatever ? you may have. Don't miss the wine bar and the hot chocolate bar. Spacious rooms. Perfect for business and for theatre guests. A little quiet area during weekends. 
The Allegro in downtown Chicago is a great stay/ part of the Kimpton Group boutique hotels the Allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price/ they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city. i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the 'EL' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel/ otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors,comfortable beds and in my case great views. if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days / kimpton does a great job and their properties are "class acts" 
We booked this hotel for the second leg of our Chicago stay..it was great!!!! The Lion King package was pricey but reasonable, given the ticket costs and the Suite. Room was great....classical music greeted us when we entered our room after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. NYTimes and Chicago Tribune at your door every morning. One block from the Washington El train station. We never saw the small rooms that every one apparently doesn't like, but the Suite rooms were fun and our kids loved it. Dunkin Doughnuts and Corner Bakery down the block. City Hall, Picasso structure....this was a great place. Book it and also use the Golden Touch Limo service...reasonable. Omar is a super guy. 
This hotel cannot be beat for location, price, & atmosphere. The location is ideal, at the corner of State & Kinzie. There are fantastic restaurants & bars all around, including House of Blues & Harry Caray's. We stayed in a "Corner King" room. The room was amazing. Two of the four walls are floor to ceiling windows. Even just being on the 5th floor, we had great views of the surrounding area. The decor and amenities are unmatched. The decor is very clean & simple but luxurious. The hotel is easy to miss from street level, but shouldn't be. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Its a perfect home base if your plans revolve around River North, State Street shopping, or Clark Street nightlife. Even if you'll be on the Mag Mile, this is a short cab ride away. We've officially named this our downtown hotel of choice! 
Stayed here for two days in the first week in January, when hotel was very quiet. Got a big corner room. Staff are friendly, decor is modern, and there's a huge choice of pastries and cakes and breads for breakfast, which you take back to your room. The free hors d'oevres with the drinks are great antipasti - olives, breads, cheeses and meats, marinated vegetables. This was a really easy hotel to stay in, fairly central - a couple of blocks away from the 'L', and quiet, despite the building work opposite. If you're in Chicago, stay here. 
We attended a Bachorette Party in Chicago in Aug 2005. There were 10 girls total. We had 5 rooms ... and I did not hear one complaint from anyone during our entire extended weekend. Never been to Chi-town before, I booked our hotel based on reviews from TA. And we were not disappointed. The staff is wonderful, the happy hour was just fabulous. The room was nice and clean, with a great double headed shower and Aveda products was an extra bonus! Then you also get free internet in your room! The hotel was chic and hip without the pretentiousness. We still talk about what a wonderful time we had ... and we all agree that if we ever go back to Chicago we will be staying at the Amalfi again. Trust me the pics don't do it justice! 
This small boutique hotel is tucked away in a perfect location between the Loop and the Miracle Mile. Two blocks west of the Wrigley Building and so convenient to restaurants, etc. The staff, from doormen to desk folks are extra nice and accommodating. The delicious breakfast on each floor is ultra-convenient, the evening happy hour is more than generous, and the morning paper is welcome. Bedding is so comfortable. This is our second stay, and certainly not our last. We love Chicago, and this hotel is one of the reasons why. 
We arrived for a weekend stay and really enjoyed the hotel. The cocktail hour was so full of people that we could not get in. The second night we went earlier and it was very nice. The staff was very helpful and had a good knowledge of the area. The rooms were modern and very clean. We will stay there again. 
Just spent three nights at the Amalfi Hotel, while in Chicago on business. Booked a king-corner room and loved it. Largest room I've ever had in a hotel in Chicago, incredibly comfortable, very clean. The breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too. And the location couldn't be beat. Walking distance to the the River, the Loop, Michigan Ave shopping and convenient to public transportation. I noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise; yes there is some street noise, and the building across the street is under construction (the noise from that was usually between 730-4, if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side) but really, in downtown Chicago it's not going to be silent, if you want silence stay in the suburbs. If you want a great hotel (at a great price) right in the thick of everything, stay at the Amalfi. 
What a wonderful experience, super great, helpful, friendly staff. Angie at the front desk made sure my husbands birthday would be great. Our room was beautiful. Angie suggested we go to Sullivans for dinner..perfect choice, make the reservation for us.(best seat in the house and a special dessert) wow...Above and beyond what any other hotel or staff has done for us before..Looking forward to staying there again & again. THANKS AGAIN 
This hotel was great - In a great area right downtown and close to everything. The daily happy hour had great food, wine and premium liquors. The free breakfast was even better! Actually I believe everything was included breakfast/happy hour/business center/WiFi. Our room was a king size facing the back of the building. Really clean new and comfortable. Small touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel - Would highly recommend. 
This was our second time staying here. We were very much looking forward to our weekend at the Amalfi (based on how well the first stay was). It turned out better than our anticipation. The beds are very comfortable. 2 headed showers with a large bathroom. The hotel is also pleasantly quiet and easy to check-in and out. Our room was near the exercise room which helped motivate us to get in an hour morning workout. Then we were able to grab some complimentary fruit, pastries, juice and coffee on our floor (breakfast is on every floor). No great view from our room, but I don't think there are great views from most any room since it is only 5 floors. We didn't need to drive, take a cab or jump on the L the whole weekend since the hotel is centrally located. We easily walked to bars, blues clubs, restaurants, the hancock tower, the loop and the waterfront all from our hotel. The highlight of the hotel was the complimentary happy hour. Free top-shelf drinks and wonderful meats, cheeses, peppers, and breads. This ran from 5:30 to 7:00, and was a great warm-up to a nice dinner. This alone saved us a bundle in money that would of been spent eating and drinking out in the evening. And an extra money-saving tip...park at the self-park lot 2 blocks west of the hotel on Kinzie. Its $24 per night during the week and only $6 per night on the weekends. I think the hotel charges $30 to $40 per night to park. 
Review's a little late, but... My husband & I first stayed at the Amalfi in 8/06 totally based on reviews I read on this website. We were totally WOWED!! Loved the location, the room, the Aveda bath products, but most of all loved the evening reception & breakfast on our floor. I returned to Chicago with 3 girlfriends in 9/07 and booked us in a suite at the Amalfi. It was great - room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased! Will stay next time I'm in Chicago too!! P.S. They honor a government rate!!!! 
My wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago and enjoyed everything about the Hotel. Most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space, great jazz CD's in the room, wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The staff was very helpful with every request. The Amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry's, fruit's and jucie's. We also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta's for their guests. Would highly recommend this hotel. 
I have stayed at the Amalfi Hotel before and it has always been excellent. This time was no different. Usually I book direct with the hotel, however, I found a slightly better deal booking through Expedia, which saved about $100. The staff were great. I arrived early and they had a room waiting. I was placed on the 6th (top) floor and it was quiet and comfortable. Overall, it was as good as it gets! I will definitely continue to stay here when I'm in Chicago. Remember, the hotel is close to everything - downtown, the Magnificent Mile, lots of restaurants, etc. Everything is within walking distance! 
This lovely hotel has only six floors, making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception. The building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it. Trump's huge new tower is just down the street. The Amalfi looks recently refurbished, very modern, but warm and inviting. Bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very, very comfortable beds. Bathroom quite small but roomy enough, with Aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers. Continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor. Great to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc (robes & slippers provided) without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast. Really enjoyed the Managers evening cocktail reception, especially the Amalfitinis. A nice way to relax after a hard days' shopping! Location is great for all the shops, transport, museums etc. Easy walking to everywhere. Staff also very friendly and welcoming. Would definately stay there again. 
This hotel was wonderful! I am a college student who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it! Pros: THE FRONT DESK and THE STAFF!!! -Helpful: Knew great places to eat and HOW to get there Breakfast: Pastries, coffee, tea, muffins, etc: Fresh Drinks + hors d'oeuvres: Yummy!! Rooms -Clean -Well decorated Lots of people of different ages stayed there Cons: Very very very far from the museums 
We stayed for just one night ,but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite. The rooms were clean and large. The decor had just been redone. The best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night. We got a great rate and would go back. Great location for walking around. 
I decided to book at the Amalfi after cancelling a reservation for a different hotel after reading their reviews on TA. I was blown away by the reviews for the Amalfi on TA and decided to check it out. I was able to secure a great price on the hotel room and I was not disappointed. I asked to be put in a quiet room because I was having an interview the next day. The room was very quiet and in a great location, but my only complaint was that it was right next to the fitness center and I could hear people running on the treadmill during the day. However, it quieted down at night and I could not hear anything. The rooms were enormous for Chicago and I was pleased!!! The hotel provided free breakfast which was good, free internet, and free gym access. The hotel is only a few blocks from the Magnificient Mile and I walked there everyday to do shopping. I have to say that the doorman is truly a gem and is very friendly. I wish that their front desk staff were as friendly as he was. All in all, I plan to stay at the Amalfi anytime I visit Chicago in the future. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting accommodation in Chicago. Ideal position, lovely quiet rooms, good facilities, complimentary breakfast well received and the Manager's evening drinks reception excellent; we always tipped the staff who were serving our drinks. The in-house Amalfitini cocktail was very good. The staff were very friendly and helpful. If I ever return to Chicago I would certainly stay there again. Theres nothing bad I can say about this hotel. 
Spent a wonderful night at the Amalfi with friends. The evening reception was very nice and the staff was very attentive. Breakfast was a plus, rooms were cozy and very clean. Would not hesitate to go back again. 
I already wrote a review about all the free stuff you get but now I'm going to write about the location! I like to walk. This place was close to EVERYTHING!!!! The 'Taste of Chicago' was on during the 4th of July. Let me tell you, this was the best 'taste' of a city that I have ever been to. It was massive and took 10 mins to walk there. I took the train in from the airport (it was around $2.00 but it was a solid 45 mins but for $2.00, how can you complain?)and it was approx a 10 walk to the hotel. We pretty much walked everywhere. We walked the entire magnificent mile strip. We went to the Blue Navy or whatever the docks are called. My favourite bar was 'Pops for Champagne.' Wow. I love champagne. And then of course there was the John Hancock Centre. And lots of shopping! 
Well located and well staffed. The Amalfi was a clean and comfortable place to stay. It lacks a restaurant or bar but many are near by. Free continental breakfast and evening cocktail. 
My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-October. We decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of Chicago in a week. I'll start out by saying that this was a great experience. At check-in, I indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite. The Ambassador East is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the North end of the Magnificent Mile. It is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on Rush. Our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed. Our suite (on the 3rd floor) had two very large closets, a large "living room" and a large bedroom. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough. If I would have payed full price for this suite, I probably would have given it a rating of 4, but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and I had such a great time here, I decided to give it a five. It is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful. My wife and I decided to eat at The Pump Room restaurant, but we were not very impressed. We found the food and service mediocre. The atmosphere was probably pretty neat when Sinatra used to eat there back in the day, but not anymore. Although we were unimpressed by the Pump Room, the staff were kind enough to seat us in the "Sinatra Booth" which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains. That neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here. The Ambassador East is an older hotel, but it is in a charming older neighborhood. The staff's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me. When we are in Chicago again, we will definitely consider staying at the Ambassador East again. 
Our stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was extremely relaxing and pleasant. We enjoyed the location. We could easily walk to the Red line or access the bus lines along Michigan Avenue. We felt safe walking along the neighborhood streets and viewing the fabulous architecture that is on N. State Street and Dearborn. We walked to 3rd Coast Cafe, the Chicago History Museum, and Second City from our hotel. Our room was spacious and well-kept, and it was quiet enough for us to take a nap during the afternoon before heading out again in the evening. We would choose to stay there again even if we could afford more expensive locations downtown. We definitely enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the place. 
The Ambassador East is located in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago. It is just a few blocks from the train station, so it was easy to get anywhere in town. The hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. We loved the Pump Room bar with tons of B & W photos of celebrities. The service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful. 
My stay at the Ambassador East was great! The hotel is in a great location in the charming Gold Coast neighborhood of downtown Chicago. Gave me the feeling of staying in a Chicago neighborhood vs. the concrete jungle of downtown, but the Magnificent Mile and Rush Street are just a few blocks from the front door. The staff was very friendly. Also, really enjoyed having drinks in the historic Pump Room. They had a live band on Saturday, and I really enjoyed looking at the pictures of the celebrities throughout the lounge that visited from years gone by. Definitely recommend it. 
Recently returned from a two-night stay at Ambassador East Hotel. Was looking for a comfortable hotel to stay at while visiting family now located in Chicago. Mission was accomplished. If you would like a quiet, comfortable hotel in a great area - this is it. While some of the furnishings show some signs of their age, it does not detract from the elegant style of the rooms and adds to the comfortable and home-like feeling. Found staff to be friendly and helpful. We will be return guests many times in the future for sure. 
The staff recognizes you by name with excellent eye contact. The "welcome back" sets the tone for your stay. Flowers in the lobby and reception area beautiful. The house-keeping staff is terrific, helpful and prompt. Room service food was served hot and that makes a big difference too. Pump Room food was surprising tasty and impressed my clients. Well done! 
We just returned from 4 nights at the Ambassador East. What a gem! The location in the Gold Coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the Magnificent Mile. There is a train station about 2 blocks away. The room was very comfortable, with nice amenities, and there is free Internet service on the 2nd floor. Best of all was the bell and lobby staff! They really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived. I would say that this was the nicest hotel staff I've encountered in all my travels. 
We live down the block from the hotel. We arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away. The floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night. I think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there. Over the years I had had some visiting groups stay there. I had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself. The lobby is elegant. The service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated. The location is the best residential area in the city (as far as I am concerned -- I live two blocks away) and it is very convenient to North Michigan Avenue ( a good shopping street) and reasonably convenient to the Loop ( the main business area) There are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city. I paid less than $100 including tax for one night. I am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around. 
Be prepared the hotel is old. It is on the historic list. The is updating to be done no doubt.. So just be forewarned. It is clean and the staff is phenomenal. Having said that, you can not beat the location. Right in the heart of the Gold coast. Take a train from O'hare right into the city. It drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel. One block from the beach and public transportation is right there. Incredible area to explore. I highly recommend the Ambassador East 
I love the Ambassador East, true, she's a little old but she's a classic treasure. The service is wonderful, from the minute you arrive you are greeted warmly and with a nice welcome! I felt the service was good, room was clean and quiet and that all the staff was very accomodating. The biggest gem is the Pump Room bar and restaurant. The best drinks, amazing food, exciting photographs and fun music on the weekends. This is set in the most fabulous location; historical neightborhood, close to walk the lakefront, well known hometown bars, excellent restaurants Chicago has to offer and most of all shopping. There was a nice street market going on over the summer-fall weekends, giving this area a real interesting flavor of Chicago. I can see it needs some updating but I was totally happy and content with my stay. I travel a great deal in my work and have seen all kinds of hotels. I will stay here again in the future. 
WOW!! Where do I start? Booked this hotel through Hotels.com for less than I paid for the Travellodge Downtown. Check in was a breeze, the entire staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was huge. The king bed was very comfortable. Our room also had 2 nightstands, 2 chairs with a small table, a desk, and walk-in closet. Even with all the furniture, the room was very spacious. The room did show some signs of wear, but I think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel. The hotel is located in a neighborhood, so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. There is very little noise, however, you are only about 2 blocks from Rush and Division streets, with all the nightlife, and the Red Line at Clark and Division is only 3 blocks away. We decided to walk to Michigan Ave and the next thing we knew, we were at the Hancock building. By staying here, you are away from the noise, but not away from the action. Had breakfast at the Pump Room, which is a story in itself. We had our photo taken in booth 1. Take some time and research who has sat in this booth. It is impressive. Some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the Pump Room. Didn't have a chance to have dinner here, but I will return for dinner someday. Breakfast was not anything fancy, and a bit pricy, but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion. The waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was. I can't wait to return here! 
In a very nice location close to shopping and places to eat and also in a beautiful neighborhood. A small hotel with a pleasant place to sit in the lobby, the Pump Room is a classic place to have a drink. We did not have dinner there so I can not comment but we enjoyed people watching while we had an afternoon drink looking out the window at the people in the neighborhood. It is a short walk to very good shopping and eating. 
We also just returned from a frigid weekend in Chicago. I booked the Ambassador East because of its great rate, $89.00 with my AAA card and we were delighted. Yes, the rooms show some signs of wear, but the warmth and charm far make up for it. This was such a pleasant change from the sleek, modern look of many other chain and boutique hotels. We became members of the I preferred program and were therefore eligible for an upgrade which we automatically got upon check in. We had a lovely suite with lots of sitting room and a comfortable bedroom and bathroom. We had wonderful food at the Pump Room which is classic. Our oatmeal there was so tastefully served, I'd love to have some right now! The location was great. Had it been normal winter weather, we could have easily walked to Michigan Avenue for shopping, but due to the minus 20 degree windchills, we opted for a cab which was less than a $5.00 fare. We also enjoyed a glass of wine around the fireplace in the lobby and found it so welcoming and cozy and not overcrowed at all. We would definitely stay here again! 
I loved the Ambassador! What a great hotel. It's really beautiful, and the room was absolutely striking, very classic and elegant. Everything was done really well: the staff treated me like a regular. This is a top-notch hotel, the best place I've stayed in a long time. My only complaint is that I wish it was on the Mile, but that's it. 
My company booked our group for a Conference and Sales Meeting. The service was friendly, helpful and the property was beautiful. The hotel was clean and filled with history. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the rate was reasonable as well. 
Just returned from 2 nights at the Ambassador and I have to say that I am very happy that I chose this hotel. It is true that this is an older hotel. But it is well kept and it does not lack in style and grandeur. (think of the hotel from the Shining, minus the elevator of blood and creepy twins.) From the check-in desk to the surprise turn down service from the maids, I was made to feel like royalty. A special acknowledgment goes out to the doormen who helped me with all my tourist questions. Also the location of the hotel is great. Close to all the action, but on a quite residential street with beautiful old mansions. I also got a sweet $89 per night room by booking on travelzoo. That was just an added bonus however. Even if I paid $200 per night, my impression of the Ambassador would not change. Highly, highly recommended. 
Ambassador East is an awesome hotel!!! Understand that this hotel is full of history and is a boutique hotel. My family stayed at the Ambassador for two nights in a suite. Very clean room with great space. The best part of the Ambassador is not the rooms though. The staff was extremely courteous, especially the concierge. If you stay here you have to go to the Pump Room. The restaurant is full of nostalgia, the staff is great, and the food is excellent. Great atmosphere and music. 
Upon check in - the lobby was BUSY! I was tired and not feeling well from a tough road show. The Front Desk person I checked in with was so fast and so nice that I walked away from the desk smiling... that alone was such a great feeling. Every time I had any experience with a hotel staff member, I was so pleased! I have to say - service really is everything to me and I have to give this top marks for that. An added bonus was the location... I just think it is perfect for me. On top of that, I had a meeting down in the loop, but not quite sure how to get there - a person approached me in the lobby, asked if he could help me get to my meeting. I thought he was getting me a taxi - but no - he walked me to his SUV and drove me to the meeting, "just a free service from the hotel" he stated as we drove... really!!!! so cool! I haven't even talked about the Pump Room yet - great dinner, very professional service, and no attitude. I will return - just up date the rooms a little bit, thats all... the curtains need some help. 
Booked a room online and got a great rate under $200 which is very cheap for a summer hotel room in Chicago in this nice location, 3 blocks I think from the water. Even though our rate was so cheap, the service was wonderful, the front desk were polite& cheerful, the doormen and valet were great and helpful, and they even put a fridge in our room when we requested on, free of charge! The fitness room was clean, large and provided fruit and clean towels, and it had the greatest view of the city as it was on the top floor of the hotel. Location of hotel is safe, and such a beautiful area. Check the rates directly online of the hotel's website, as it was the least expensive. We will stay here again for sure. 
We stayed at the AE for two nights for a three generation "girls weekend" (Grandma, mom and daughter). I looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. Then I called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named Reece. Rates were a bit high for the Saturday night portion of our stay but when I requested the American Girl Package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. The American Girl package was perfect for us. My 8 year old daughter was thrilled. They give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. They have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). She also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. Our room, 1334, was large and clean. It had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. The employees are all very friendly and helpful. We had a drink in the Pump Room but did not eat there. We ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd Coast. This hotel is north of Michigan Ave. But it is just a short, pleasant walk to the Mag. Mile. I would definately stay here again in Chicago. 
I just left the Conrad Chicago and have nothing but good things to say. We used Hilton points to stay there but paid $35/night to upgrade to a junior suite. We were in room 1519. I would reccomend people ask for an odd numbered room so that they will have a view looking north on Michigan Ave. Our room was very modern with 2 large HD/flat panel tv and Bose 3 speaker sound system. 4 big windows that actually open. The bed lineds were very nice, the towels were OK. The room was clean and the bath room had a seperate shower and tub. Marble everywhere. Robes, slippers, etc. The work out room was good with different machines and some free weights. There are clean towels in the workout room too. We never ate in the hotel so I can't comment on the food or the prices. There is a Starbucks across the street (Michigan) and an Espresso bar attached to the Nordstrom that is on the ground floor of the hotel. It was very nice to have the little mall right under the hotel. The location of the hotel could not be better. We were walking distance to everything. Every kind of shopping or dinning experience you could possibly want was within 2 miles. Over all the hotel had a boutique feel to it even though it is part of the hilton chain. 
My wife and I came to spend the weekend in downtown Chicago for shopping and we found this Conrad hotel well located close to everything downtown and of a size that doesn't make you feel lost in the Convention world. We have had this feeling when staying at larger hotels in the past. Our Suite has view on Michigan avenue with a bit of the Lake at the end. Staff was very professional, pleasant and friendly making us feel very comfortable. Internet is free n the rooms and I am making my review from there. 
We have just returned from 4 nights at the Conrad Chicago, everthing about the hotel was excellent. Wonderful room and service from all the staff was first class. Great view from our room. The hotels location is great, right in the centre of the magnificent mile. A wonderful stay in an amazing city was made perfect by our stay at the Conrad. 
We spent a week in this hotel and were very pleased with the experience. As described in previous reviews. the room was very comfortable with the huge televison and bathroom being particularly outstanding. Service was excellent overall (I especially liked the bottle of water at my bedside with the turn down service). The door and bellmen/women were particularly pleasant and helpful and the concierge was friendly and knowledgeable. We had completely satisfactory (though overpriced) drinks in the bar but didn't eat at the restaurant. The health club was fine and the equipment was well maintained. While there were only three treadmills and two elipitical steppers, I never had to wait for a machine although it might be a different story in the dead of a Chicago winter! One minor quibble--I like to have coffee first thing in the morning and there was no in-room coffee maker. The restaurant offered free coffee "to-go" but only before eight AM. This is a very, very comfortable, attractive hotel in a wonderful location. Chicago is an expensive city but we felt that we got a reasonable value for our money. 
Arrived on 06/04/05, greeted by friendly doorman, and zipped up to the 5th Floor Lobby. Very open lobby area with friendly reception staff. Room was on the 12th Floor and very nice. Everything was in order and very clean! The king size bed was nice and each night I had a restful sleep. Bathroom was large with separate glass shower stall. The room was furnished with everything I needed including internet hook-up access. Also, you can walk thru on the 5th Fl to the Westfield North Bridge Shopping Mall, where you will enjoy Nordstrom and other stores. Of course, you're steps from Michigan Ave. too. The central location of the hotel was great, as I could walk to most places. The CTA Subway stop (Grand Ave. on Red Line) was an easy 2 block walk. I will stay here again on my next trip to Chicago! 
My husband and I decided to take a trip to Chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the Conrad, not really knowing it's location. We were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on Michigan Ave. (It's connect to Nordstroms right in the heart of downtown. ) Great for shopping. The hotel itself was fabulous. The staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants. I recommend going to Joe's that's right across the street from the hotel. Everyone was raving about it . . .but we couldn't get a reservation. The room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. It had a very warm and inviting atmosphere. My husband loved the workout room. I highly recommend the Conrad!! 
Ok, so first trip to chicago and I was a litlle worried about the hotel and the location, finally I decided on the CONRAD and wath a good experience i had, I booked a king deluxe room on the 6th floor, view was not amazing but that was the only coplaint i could had, room is nice, bath was all appliances and good size, good plasma tv, free internet, we asked one day for breaksfast and amazing food! so overall and for the price aroufn 220 It was a great surprise, the locating was very good a few blocks from everything and very quiet hotel 
We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion. The room was clean and new feeling, nice city view, free bottled water in room upon arrival. Check in was a breeze, and our room was ready even though we were several hours early. All staff was friendly and helpful, excellent breakfast. 
We stayed for a one night getaway with family on a thursday. Triple AAA rate of 173 was a steal. 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma TV bose stereo, voss and evian water, and gorgeous bathroom(no tub but was fine for us) Concierge was very helpful. You cannot beat this location... Only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow(2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. Food was very good so it was worth the wait. I would return in a heartbeat. A gem in chicago... 
We stayed at the Conrad for only one evening but it was such an amazing room we would have liked to stay longer! We were on the newly renovated 9th floor and the room was gorgeous and super clean! There was a flat screen, bose sound system and even an Ihome for our Ipod. Wireless was free and they bring you a free bottle of water at turn down. Everyone was very helpful and so friendly. We can't wait to go back again! 
We usually stay at the Sofitel but thought we would try the Conrad for a change. I don't think I would rate this hotel over the Sofitel but it was still 1st class. But I do think the service was better at the Conrad. We arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left. Normally service goes down hill then but our waiter Eric was the best. Even when I kept ordering my after dinner ports. The meal may not have been The Chop House but it was still very good. The bar was ok, no Crown Reserve. They did have the Cask 16 at $24 a drink, ouch. The room service was very quick. Our room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the ashtrays during their visits. The only fault we could find was the temperature on the 14th floor. It was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off. Which wasn't so bad since my wife smokes. The temp on the 5th where the lobby, bar, and restaurant was fine. We enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in Sept. One last thing, if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast. Go to the West Egg, only a few blocks away. 
My husband and I stayed here for New Years eve weekend. This is an excellent hotel in an excellent location. Hotel is very tastefully decorated and warmly welcoming. The rooms had the best electronics I've ever seen. Loved that they had a soaking tub and a spacious shower stall. The hotel restaurant seemed to be empty everytime we walked by, so we avoided it too. Ate at Joe's across the street - excellent seafood. And you can shop til you drop without going outside! Nordstroms and four story mall is attached. Lots of good "food on the run" places in there. Loved Chicago - loved the Conrad. I will go back! 
My boyfriend and I decided to stay at the Conrad Chicago for our anniversary. The second we walked in, we were immediately won over by the look and feel of the room. White luxurous bedding on the King bed, plasma t.v./ subroofer/ surround sound speakers (my boyfriend was more impressed than me, as I reminded him that we didn't come to Chicago for the hotel room) very large bathroom w/ tub and separate stand-in shower, granite countertops, his/ her robes and slippers. The view wasn't great, but we were on the 6th floor and not really high enough to see anything but the side of the building next to us. Not a large room by any means, but again . . . we didn't go to the city for the hotel room. It was the prefect size for the amount of time we were actually in the room. We got a great rate on it ($140 at hotels.com) but I think the going rate is usually closer to mid $200's. I've stayed in quite a few hotels in the downtown area and none have ever impressed me more than this one. We will definitely be staying there again on our next trip into the city. 
This was a weekend trip for my friends and I. We booked a couple of rooms and asked in advanced for the reservations to be connected in some way. Our rooms were right next to one another as requested. As it was almost everyone's first time to Chicago, we had to do a bit of cold-searching for a hotel. And, our choice was next to perfect. I had an amazing time during my first visit to Chicago and it was largely due to this hotel. The customer service was AMAZING. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. One of our rooms ordered late night room service and raved about how they felt they had ordered a 5 star lunch because it was as fresh as having ordered food at 2 pm, and delicious. My friend suggested they had a full-staff at 3 am because the food came up quickly too. In another of our rooms, housekeeping had accidentally discarded a CD when replacing the CD player with an iPod dock. The concierge had the exact CD purchased and ready at check-out from the neighboring record store. Our rate included complimentary breakfast which was fantastic! Everything was freshly made in their kitchen too. An added bonus was that the hotel is attached to a mall. Therefore, you don't need to leave the building to get a pair of shoes, a coffee, or a some other type of trinket. I was beyond pleased with this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation. 
The Conrad Hotel is a beautiful hotel. Our room was perfect and beautiful in every way. I was very impressed (and I am hard to please and have high standards). It was so clean, aesthetically pleasing, up to date, just gorgeous! I would definitely stay there again. I loved it. The location is superb too, attached to Nordstrom and Northbridge mall. Can't wait to go back! 
I travelled to Chicago last week with my daughter for some Christmas shopping. We booked the Conrad based on the reviews on Tripadvisor. It lived up to all expectations. Great big room, with two king size beds. Very comfortable. Breakfast was great, loads of choice and plenty on the plate. Great location, connected to a shopping mall which was very useful the day it snowed. All and all, a great hotel and we would go back in the morning. Chicago is a great city with very friendly people. 
My wife and I stayed here in the middle of February 2005. We took the (EL) subway to the hotel from O'Hare. It was very convenient. The lobby was nice and the room was clean and comfortable. I've stayed in many a hotel room, this bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The hotel is located in a great area and close to everything. Walking distance to almost all the interesting sites Chicago has. Would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city. 
We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving. We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building. To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful. The staff were unbelievably helpful. The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens, luxury bedlinens, iPod radio, huge bathroom. Location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window. Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service. Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5. 
This is my second time here in two months; both stays were great. The rooms are very nice and very clean. The staff is terrific and always attentive. My only concern would be there never seems to be anyone at the concierge desk. 
This is a superb hotel. The rooms are huge, including a luxurious bathroom. It is clean and service is first rate. Breakfast was excellent (and complimentary for Hilton Honors members). Hotel is in a good location, and is connected to a mall, which I imagine would be a great asset in the Chicago winter. Next time I go to Chicago, I will stay here for sure. 
We got a great deal on this hotel, just $91 found through travelzoo. We only stayed one night, but were very impressed. The sevice was fantastic from the moment we stepped up to the property. The hotel smelled wonderful and was immaculate. Our room, while not enormous was perfect. We had a great view of the city and lake. The bed was extremely comfortable. We never heard any noise outside of our room. The bathroom was nice sized considering we must have had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel, two could get ready very comfortably. Location was perfect, just off Michigan Ave and steps away from Millenium Park. We would definetly stay here again, especially if we could get this great deal! 
Great location and quality place to stay. Lovely large clean room with a queen size bed it was great. Staff were very helpful and put us onto some great restaurants and then some music bars. Coleman on the front desk was a great guy to meet as a first impression he sold the hotel to us with his personality. The hotel delivered an anniversary cake to us in our room (compliments of the hotel) for me this showed that they care about their guests Many thanks to all it was a great place to stay. 
The reviews we read were a bit mixed, but I thought it was excellent. I've stayed in The Splendido, Villa D'Este and others and it doesn't compare, but nor should it. It doesn't claim to be in that space. I expected it to be a notch off the Four Seasons and so it proved. A only a small notch too!. Lovely clean and bright room. Superb views, very quiet, comfy bed etc. Excellent service all round and nice staff. For the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed. Couldn't really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the Four Seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience. We will go there again when in Chicago. Great location too. 
I vacationed at the Fairmont Chicago for 3 nights in July 2009. The room, the bathroom, the view, and the staff were all wonderful. I just wish the hotel were a few blocks North (on MI Ave). Sometimes, when you're tired, that extra couple of blocks seem like miles! 
For the price of the Marriott we spent a night here ($122 + tax) and had an enjoyable if brief stay. As others have noted the hotel has been recently renovated, and the rooms are furnished with attractive and sleek scandanavian-type design. The staff was polite and attentive, and seemed to match the redesign with a hip kind of feel. The parking is pricey at $49, so I used an adjacent lot and self-parked, and as others have noted, the lack of water-pressue in the shower was disappointing. Good location. Would return, esp as this pricepoint. 
I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. Staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in Aria restaurant, to the maid who cleaned my room. The rooms were recently updated, with large flat-screen TV's, beautiful linens, and exceptional toiletries in each room. My room even had a view of Monroe St. harbor. It is truly a first-rate hotel. Location is south of the river and east of Michigan Ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way (if that's possible in downtown Chicago), however its location significantly lowers street noise. The hotel has excellent access to Millennium Park, the Aon center (there is a connecting concourse), and is about 4 blocks from shopping on North Michigan Ave. I ate dinner in Aria and it was fantastic! Room service for breakfast was quite good as well. Overall, I'd stay again in a minute if I had business in the loop, or leisure plans in Millennium or Grant Parks. 
I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was very pleased with the hotel. The doorman offered me an umbrella as I headed out for a walk... and sure enough it started to rain very soon after- I would have been soaked with it. Upon my return, the doorman then asked about my walk, etc. This is reflective of all the staff I encountered. The front desk promptly checked me in. DEFINITELY register for their rewards program before you arrive... The complimentary gym access is excellent, plus you save on internet access fees which are waived for members. The bathroom and separate dressing areas were large and convenient. The only negative- no coffee maker! AND the Starbucks in the adjacent building is closed on weekends since the area corporate offices are closed those days!!! Otherwise my stay was perfect, considering the conference rate was $99 per night! 
We went to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute and selected the Fairmont because it was so close. Although the lobby is still being renovated, our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive. The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate. The only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished. The maid does not do that, and by bedtime on the first night, we still didn't have coffee. We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply. The restaurant is a little underwhelming, but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks, we probably wouldn't have eaten there any more than we did. After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels, this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return. 
From the moment I stepped up to the front entrance my luxury service began! I enjoyed every minute @ the fairmont! The King room was spacious and the decor chic! The coffee maker was the coolest and the bathroom is huge! I really like the separate shower, tub, and separate door for the toilet. The desserts and cheese spread at ENO so yummy. Before the fairmont the W hotel was my favorite chain of hotels to stay at. 
My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference. We stayed in a spacious suite. All amenities appeared recently updated and in excellent shape. The bed was very comfortable. Views were great. I love their products in the bathroom and used them in the pristine tub two out of three nights. The room was so quiet, it was very relaxing. We ate in the restaurant downstairs (Aria) and although pricey, it was excellent. The staff were consistently attentive and responsive. It is evident that everyone is very well-trained. I would love to stay here again. 
Simply a nice place to stay... I had a great deal for the room, and was impressed with the quality. Hotel staff was very helpful; they were able to let me check out and helped me print boarding passes. Negative: It is frustrating that nowadays you do not have free internet in most hotels and it's the same here; you have to pay for the internet. Negative: Loud on the phone you may hear your neighbors on the phone, or them shower. 
I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago for one night - I'm a frequent business traveler and am very familiar with travel rituals. I checked in late (almost 10pm) due to flight cancellations from my home airport -- Atlanta. I took the shuttle to the airport (best option in lieu of the over priced taxis), and it was my first time staying at the hotel. Upon arrival, I immediately noticed the entrance, which appeared very welcoming and warm to me. I checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if I'd prefer a king or double (reconfirming my reservation preference). I always take the king when I can, and the bed was fantastic! It was suited with great linen and these incredible down & feather pillows named Encompass made by The Pillow Factory -- I checked the tags, since I plan to buy some! I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - Aria, which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and YES, it does stand out all on it's own. The food is Asian fusion, and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie, I appreciate great food when I taste it! The hotel service was good as well. Only drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely. They missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet, which tasted a bit 'metallic'. But they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after I passed on the buffet. I would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view (if you can get a room with one), fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet. 
We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09. We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $69 (normal rate was around $200). The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed. Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient. Parking is very expensive at $50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $30. We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere. We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict. They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we didn't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast. Glad we didn't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better. I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit. 
I stayed at the Fairmont during a professional conference. While I have to say that for a conference, some of the meeting rooms were too small, in terms of traveler's comfort the hotel is exceptional! I can't think of a single thing about my room that wasn't perfect. The accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many Chicago attractions. 
Nestled just off the beaten path and about two blocks from the river the Fairmont Chicago offers an excellent location to operate as home base for your trip to Chicago. The staff were friendly and helpful, arranging many of the sightseeing events we enjoyed while in the city. There are many attractions withiin easy walking distance (The Art Institute is a must see and Millenium Park is a fun visit). The architectural tour by river departs a dock that is very close to the Fairmont and there are lots of restaurants nearby. The rooms were excellent and the club room is worth the extra expense. We would definitely stay here again. 
We recently completed our second stay at the Fairmont Chicago. The check-in process was quick and painless but the front desk staff was almost disinterested in the whole procedure. That is fine when I am traveling on business, but on leisure trips I would appreciate a warmer greeting. The hotel was hosting a convention at the same time as our stay, but other than seeing some signage/attendees in the lobby, we wouldn't have noticed. This is probably due to the separation of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 speedy elevators. We stayed in a Parkview Suite so we had a large room with a great view of Millenium Park. The anteroom was well appointed with a sofa, coffee table, desk, mini-bar with sink and coffee maker, and dining area. The bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard Fairmont room, but maybe slightly larger. The bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard Fairmont room, and once again, possibly slightly larger. The upscale modern decor is pleasing but not overtly luxurious, and several small touches such as a shoe shine station (with extra collar tabs), are peppered throughout. We booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly handled. The hotel restaurant, Aria, couldn't find our reservation but they oddly new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us. They had no problem seating us and the dinner (both food and service) was lovely. Minor complaints: The pillows could be better. I'm not sure if they remembered our preference for non-down bedding from our last visit, but seriously, these things barely felt like pillows. I'll suffer through some congestion if I can get better neck support. Also, the valet parking attendants seem overly eager to take your car (and charge you $49). And as I mentioned above, the front desk experience could be improved. Best feature: After our first stay, I gave a brief review in the comments section of the Fairmont President's Club (membership is free) website. I received a phone call from the Director of Rooms the same day asking to discuss our experience. After this stay, I left a comment essentially thanking the hotel staff for a great stay, but still received a warm, friendly phone call from the Director of Rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay. Kudos to the Fairmont for taking its customers seriously, and for that, they've won my loyalty. 
I actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price! It was a lovely hotel, beautifully appointed, walking distance from the places we wanted to go. We would highly recommend the Fairmont. 
We stayed at the Fairmont two nights for the SOFA art fair at the Navy Pier. I was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and pronounced it correctly, which is quite unusual. Everyone smiled and welcomed us. The lobby looks clean and friendly, not ultramodern, but not at all tired or worn. Our room, also clean and comfortably furnished, was larger than we expected, with a clean, modern bath and a lovely view of the Navy Pier and the lake. We did not eat at the restaurant, but it looked attractive. Our only problem was that we had asked for non-feather pillows, upon reserving the room, upon checking in, and calling housekeeping. After waiting an hour, we went to bed. The next day the check-in desk person was extremely apologetic and by the time we returned, all the feathers were replaced with foam and non-allergenic materials. The hotel is convenient to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave. We would stay there again, assuming we could get good rates. 
The concierge was so helpful. Without hesitation they had the best recommendations for restaurants and attractions all turning out to be wonderful. They even gave us business cards for restaurants that did not take reservations so we could obtain preferential or immediate seating's. Loved the health club at the back of the hotel. By joining the presidents club, it only cost ten dollars a day to use the facilities. The rooms were large, updated and had views looking out in 3 directions. The coffee maker in the room was exceptional. Location is great for getting mostly anywhere. Parking is overpriced so we took our cart to the underground Millennium Garage that was only $25.00 per 24 hours and a few blocks walk from the hotel. 
I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent. I was given a very large room with great views of the city; the breakfast was extremely good; and the location was as central as I could have wished for. The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims. In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too. Highly recommended as a base for exploring Chicago. 
We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend. We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. Hooray! We were on the 5th floor (Beatles theme). The rooms were very comfortable. One of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. Not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable, the bathroom was full of Aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. No problems there. We did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead. He said it was wonderful. We did use the free internet in our rooms. It was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. The room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. There was virtually no hall / elevator noise. The location of the Hard Rock is ideal. It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery, just blocks to either Grant Park, The Art Institute, State Street Shopping, or Michigan Ave. To sum up, there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about. We would be glad to stay here again any time. 
Got a great deal through Hotwire for $70 a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again, even at full price. We really liked the rooms muted modern decor, we had John Lennon and Bono for company. Comfortable bed, mini coffe maker, plenty storage space and a lovely, clean bathroom stocked full of Aveda products (so I was sold straight away...it doesn't take much, I know!). If you're a product junkie, tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies :) We liked the location and had a great view down N Michigan Ave, found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed (reception, gift shop and bar). The bar area is very trendy, I liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause I normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking...the lack of memorabilia didn't bother me but I was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway. The only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh, and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a "friendly lady looking for business" when he was at the bar. I think it's a place you will either love or hate, if you like laid back, contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you! 
Just putting in a good word for the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. The reviews I read before going were mixed so we were not sure what to expect. The location was perfect. The hotel was beautiful. Our view was awesome. The room was large enough and very clean. The bed was very comfy. The staff were helpful - especially the concierge, Jared. I couldn't find anything negative to say. If you want to stay in downtown Chicago - you can't go wrong with this cool hotel. 
This is a stylish hotel located right on North Michigan Avenue, a five minute walk from the Orange "Loop" line that will get you to and from Midway Airport. Forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. Our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft, we were told). Decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. On the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. No kidding. The bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. On the positive side, however, there were Aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. The king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. We had a largish TV with a DVD player. There is a safe and munchies. The gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. It is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. There are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. Suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to L2 to get to the gym. This way you dont have to traverse the lobby. The front desk staff is amiable, and very attentive. I read some other reviews about nasty personnel, but did not have that experience at all. I got a free newspaper with a smile, a free stamp when I needed it, change and all the coffee I could tolerate in the morning. The Hard Rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the Water Tower, the Drury Theater, John Hancock, and magnificent mile. For those who like a thrifty breakfast, we recommend Gourmet Pantry at 155 N. Michigan Avenue [--]. This deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a Sunday morning, no less: $1.99. The hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person, but we did not partake of it. We would stay at the Hard Rock again, and think it is great for people with "tweens." Not sure about the toddler set, though. 
The Hard Rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway. The rooms are quiet, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size. We had fabulous service and got a great rate. Other than the fact that there were no bathrobes (it's listed as an amenity) and the Sony radio didn't work, it was perfect. Would definitely stay there again! 
We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night to do some intense, day-after-Thanksgiving shopping. It really is a great hotel. The rooms are really cool, and we were just in the basic one. The bed is extremely comfortable, with the softest sheets and great pillows. The technology in the room is great. They have nice upscale tolietries in the bathrooms. For a very modern room, it is still comfortable and homey. The location is perfect for getting wherever you want to go. The staff were very nice and helpful. The bar is really funky with an interesting martini menu. One of the best hotels I have stayed at in Chicago. Really enjoyed it and would highly recommend. 
so my sweetie lures me out under the guise of dinner at the China Grill, upon arrival he tells me his boys are watching the game in a suite upstairs and want to say hi...we arrive at the 35th floor and my oh my!!! SURPRISE!!! ladies and gentlemen THIS is something to be admired...spacious and roomy, yet warm, cozy and inviting...great bed, comfortable furniture, great 42 inch plasmas, and the views are UNBELIEVABLE...my only complaint? a shower should have a door to keep the heat IN...other than that no complaints, room service was great, morning coffee was yummo...overall a fabulous experience!!! 
I stayed here August 20 through 23rd with my sixteen year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. The price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on Michigan Avenue. The front desk and concierge service was excellent and enhanced our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities. The John Entwistle theme on our floor was a nice touch. Any of you single fathers out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago really helped me accomplish just that! 
Stayed for 3 nights for our anniversary. The desk clerk was great and since it was our anniversary, he gave us an upgrade...imagine our surprise when we got off on a floor with only 3 other rooms! Corner tower suite with a view of the river and Michigan ave. Beautiful! Cabs available right outside the lobby... Never paid more than $7 for a cab ride. If you go in Dec. you must go to the ChrisKindl Festival for strudel! 
The service from check-in to checkout was excellent - timely and efficient. The room was more then I has expected. It was spacious and laid out very well. I particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower. The bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable. I believe it's the first time I stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room. The location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go. I particularly enjoyed the excellent food at theChina Grill which is attached to the Hard Rock hotel. The service was very good and the staff very friendly. 
I was attending a conference at the Mariott. They were booked up and I shared a room at the Hard Rock for a week by default. What a lucky break. This is a beautiful hotel. I am not a fan of all that black/grey vibe and find it a little cheesy. What I loved was the way the Hard Rock left the beautiful old hotel features intact, and decorated around the basic stucture. My room was CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN. I want to comment on the staff. What an upbeat group of people. This included the doormen, the front desk, the consierge. They were wonderful! Every morning one of the bell men would find my TV morning news show for me in the bar, while I drank their courtesy coffee. They brought us a refrigerator, IPOD dock, and extra suitcase stand within minutes of check-in. I had a hard time contacting the airport transport. The consierge took care of it for me. While I was waiting for the 4:50 am airport shuttle, one of the bell men found me a cup of coffee in the back. I just couldn't get over how nice and friendly everyone was....great place to stay. I hope to go back with my husband. 
This is a great hotel, in a great location, in a great city !!! There's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part. The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s) in the bathroom ... I had the Beatles and although they're not my cup of tea, I was happy enough with George staring back @ me! The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the "Cheesecake Factory" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the "John Hancock Centre". A slighty longer walk (or a short cab ride) and you're at the "Navy Pier" - take a ride on the "Seadog" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music. This hotel (& city) is WELL worth checking out. 
Awesome hotel, our room overlooked Michigan Ave and we could see the river. Very stylish, trendy room and hotel. Lacked a bit in amenities (pool, etc) but more than made up for it with the location and quality of the hotel. Booked it thought Hotwire for $99 which was awesome value. 
The Hard Rock is glossy and sexy, but an absolutely fantastic hotel.... I was in town for business and stayed here because of it's location, but I absolutely understand why tourists would like it...right on the river, cool art deco building and Millenium Park is just down the street. Regardless- the room was clean, the staff was friendly, but NOT annoying and the bar was fun. I was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were GOOD! I'll definitely try it again! 
The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago has become my favorite hotel. I've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience. As you might have guessed - it has a super Rock & Roll theme, with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor's elevator lobby. The rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians. You can request being on the floor of your favorite band (like KISS, Aerosmith, etc...) The rooms are GREAT. Well appointed. SUPER Comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows. The large TV has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience. There's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar. I've always had a room with big windows and a view down Michigan Ave (the hotel sits right on Michigan - a block from the canal). The bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design... some of the showers have windows in side of them (you can shower AND enjoy the view down Michigan!) or close the waterproof drapes. I've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here... front desk, doorman, etc are all great. There's a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy. Big screen TV to catch the latest scores, too. Of course, Rock & Roll music pumps thru the place. You can stay at a "plain" hotel anywhere... but this is a GREAT, WELL DESIGNED, FUN and MEMORABLE HOTEL that you'll want to return back to. If I had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight. My daily car parking rate was close to $50 per night, which I'm sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop. Stay here. Be cool. 
A bunch of us got together and we had a great time in this hotel we asked for limes and they gave us like a punch bowl of them the rooms were so awesome you really have to see it to believe how extradionary this hotel is i love the decorations on every floor and being surrounded by such elegance. Will definitely stay here again 
We stayed at the Hard Rock on January 27th, 2009 for $125/night. It is located on Michigan Ave, just two blocks from the Mag Mile, two blocks from Millenium Park, and five blocks from the Chicago Art Institute. Our hotel room was very nice with views of Michigan Ave and a unusually comfy bed. The hotel even offered free coffee in the lobby every morning and free wifi in the rooms. Parking was $45 for valet and $30 for self parking. The staff was very helpful with all of our request. 
The Hard Rock Hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into Chicago.. The location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as Lake Michigan, Millennium Park, and Art Museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from. My co-works LOVED the exterior of the building, views from the rooms, the art on the walls, and crisp, clean & hip feeling of the hotel, but not "too over the top" for "business". By far a better experience than your usual "chain" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms. Here you feel special...for the same price. The lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on Michigan Ave (or catch a real rock star in the lobby!) 
Stayed here for 4 nights in Apri. From check in the stay was perfect all round, staff were so helpfuly and friendly especially Chris and Scott. The location couldn't be better right on Michigan Avenue so easy access to everything. Room was lovely and spacious and always clean and tidy at the end of the day. Will definately recommend it to friends and family. 
my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york. The room was very spacious and clean, the bed was huge and extremely comfortable. I really liked the Aveda bathroom products, great smell. We had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot. Compliments to the chef. The concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to Navy pier, directions were given to us accompanied by a map. The weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show, this was spectacular. The whole of the last day of the show we spent at Navy pier and the Millenium park. Location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping. If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay here. 
We stay at Hilton for 4 nights last march. It was a pleasant stay. We got a large room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms, The TV was Ok, a 27' CRT Flat Screen. The coincierge was very friendly when we need. The room was very cleaned when we arrived, we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza was Ok also.The main Hall is beautiful. The breakfast is charged, 20 dollars, kinda expensive. The internet access (WiFi) is charged, 13 dollars/day. Pros: Low rate price, huge rooms, close to attractions at Loop, close to metro station. Cons: Expensive breakfast, Internet access charged. Tip: When leaving the building, always use the Michigan Av exit. Its a great view. 
This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. The entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park. It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. For Blues fans, Buddy Guy's Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel. Highly recommended. 
Staying at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute, budget Valentines weekend trip for my husband and me. We got a great rate -- $70 -- on Priceline. Close to the subway (red line) and we got from O'Hare to the hotel in less than an hour for $3.50 for both of us. We were able to check in more than 4 hours early. Room was great -- very clean, good closet space and fantastic bedding. Had one expensive drink at the Irish bar, but the bartender's advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price. Concierge was helpful, too. Overall, service was terrific, room was great and staying there was a treat. I would stay there again any time, especially at that price. 
went to chicago for a week in may, decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton, we were not disapointed. perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level. we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each. they beds and pillows were too die for, so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles. all the staff were very helpful. a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful. about 2 blocks away on Harrison is a cafe called "Orange" which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast, the cafe and the staff are suberb. expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning. 
We stayed here from Nov. 30 to Dec 2 and had a wonderful time. The hotel is just beautiful and the service was excellent from check in to the maid staff to the bartenders in Kitty O'Shea's. We had a room with a king bed that was very comfortable and had very nice feather pillows. You can request other types if you have a problem with feathers. The large flat screen TV was very nice. Bath products were by Crabtree & Evelyn and included shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash and bady lotion. Plenty of coffee was provided. We drank and had snacks at Kitty O'Shea's. The crowd was fun and there was live Irish folk music each night. Good selection of beer and good Shepards Pie, Cheese Dip and Crisps! The location worked very well for us. We walked to the Art Museum and Buddy Guys Blues Club is right across the street. And shopping was a breeze using the shuttle! The cab ride to the Museum of Science and Industry was quite far though and cost about $15 each way. An excellent weekend getaway! 
We travel to Chicago regularly and have always wanted to stay at the Hilton Chicago. We booked a PriceLine room on the weekend of the half marathon. The place was busy, but the staff certainly found time for each individual guest. The room was nice and just what we expected. The pool area is also very nice for a downtown hotel. The location was great as we were taking in the Bears 49ers game on a Thursday night and a Sox game on a Friiday night. We would certainly stay there again and would recomment it to others. Great quality even at the regular room price. 
I stayed here for a conference and got the conference rate of $149. I was worried that I wouldn't get a nice room, since it was the weekend before the election and the hotel is across the street from Grant Park, so it could easily have gotten a lot more for the nicer rooms. I requested a quiet room away from elevators and foot traffic, and that is exactly what I was assigned (perhaps because I am also a 'silver' member?). It was a beautiful room with windows on two sides, a king sized bed. The room was quiet, comfortable and immaculate. The maid even left a thank you note for the tip I had left. All the staff were helpful, polite and cheerful. I appreciated the fact that I could actually purchase a breakfast for under $15 (oatmeal, coffee, and juice)--something not possible at a lot of big hotels, like the Hyatt I stayed at last year. 
We had a great experience at this hotel. The hotel is Huge! The rooms were very clean, well appointed, and our room was very roomy with a great view of the snow covered park. The Staff was so nice and very helpfull. Donald, at the the Concierge desk scored us tickets to WICKED the day of the performance, and on a Holiday weekend too. They were great seats and a reasonable price. He worked very hard for us to see that show. They truely topped off what was a Fun New Years Celebration. This will be my first pick when I return in the spring. 
We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton - I am so glad we did the hotel was clean, hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing. We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny. 
I stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the Chicago Bears Fan Convention (Feb 27- March 1). The hotel is beautiful. I had a Towers room. I had a decent view of the city (Sears Tower). The room was a little small but had two bathrooms (1 King bed). The Tower room has it's own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast, evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day. The registration/ lounge is on the 24th floor and overlooks Lake Michigan. The hotel was full but service was excellent. The location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two (especially toward the El train). We loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car. I will stay here again. Hilton offered a Sunday night free on their website with a 3 day stay. This made the cost reasonable (for Chicago). However, the Pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired. The pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink. 
My stay was quick but awesome. After a long day, seeing a substantial line at check-in was a bit of a groaner, but then i saw the self-serve kiosks. i was checked in with keys in hand in under 3 minutes. in the morning i was able to check out on the TV in my room. the hotel is a beautiful historic landmark with all the amenities of a modern hotel and all the charm of its 1927 origins. The bed was FABULOUSLY comfortable. i wish i could live there. they have many rooms wtih 2 bathrooms. i stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we didn't know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms. talk about squeals of delight. that was about 7 years ago in virginia beach. i was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms, but it's the first time i've seen this since. what a great feature! 
Thirty years ago, we had a tiny "room" and indifferent service. This time, the service was superb and friendly throughout, with special commendation for the waiters and waitresses at the coffee shop, the door and bell persons, and the hilton honors person at the front desk. They even lowered our price (to moderately high) when we inquired a few days before our stay. When we want to stay south of the river downtown, we will be back 
Stayed at the Chicago Hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door I was very impressed. Check-in was quick, easy and I was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time. We were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant. It made getting ready to go out much quicker! The hotel location is great opposite the park, which is a must see. Although located on South Michigan Ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of Michigan Ave. Would also recommend the street one block back from Michigan Ave for good shopping. For breakfast I would recommend grabbing a muffin, croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant. For evening entertainment Kitty O'Sheas is a must. Typical Irish bar with good drinks and live music. Finally the bed at Hilton Chicago is the most comfortable bed ever. I would have taken it home if I could! Definately made for a good nights sleep. 
We loved the hotel. When I see other posts about it being shabby I can't for the life of me figure out what they are talking about. Rooms were large with TWO bathrooms, lobby was fabulous, pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym, staff was courteous. For us, the location was great--across the street from Grant Park with a great view of Buckingham Fountain and close to all the museums and theatres. I'm sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the Magnificent Mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location. Got it for $105 on Hotwire. What a bargain for such a nice hotel. 
I took the wife and kids to Chicago for one last fling before school started back up. When I checked in, the staff was very attentive, I showed a little consideration for the friendly attitude (small tip) and was upgraded to a huge upper floor room complete with a bar! I didn't get the "Priceline" glare and it paid off for all involved. The air and water show was underway on the lake front, and we had planes flying over our room. The kids thought it was great. That night we had a great view of the fireworks at Navy Pier. The Sunday morning breakfast buffet at the hotel was very good and the price was not out of reason. The conceirge was very knowledgeable and very friendly. It was one of the best times we ever had in Chicago. 
in the windy city ,this is a very good place.amazing rooms and service.everything is a walking distance .An absolute must for business trio as ease with which you can conduct and schedule meetings here is unbeatable. Good decor and impishly modern 
I only stayed out with my boyfriend for one night, however enjoyed my stay. The staff was friendly, the room was nice and clean, the hallways and ballrooms etc were elegant. Room service was quick and had good options to choose from that actually tasted great. The staff was able to extend our check out time for an extra 1-2 hours without an extra charge to the room. Great location too! Walking distance from the Art Museum, Millennium Park, Grant Park (right across the street) and a quick cab ride to McCormick Place. If I were in the city again I would love to stay there again. 
We booked our stay through Priceline.com and got a great deal. We were only staying one night and we had our 2 year old with us. At check-in, we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view of Lake Michigan. It was beautiful. The suite had a king bed with a living room and a bar and mini-fridge which we didn't need, but if we were staying longer, it would have been a godsend. This hotel is in close proximity with Grant Park which has the beautiful Buckingham Fountain. We walked around the park and even saw a movie being filmed....but if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of restaurants around it, this isn't the one. We ended up eating at the Irish Pub inside the hotel (Kitty O'Shea's) which has great food. (We have stayed here before and always end up eating here.) There are a lot of attractions within a mile including the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Soldier Field, and Navy Pier. They may not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window. Overall, we had another wonderful stay at the Chicago Hilton. (Our 4th stay) The only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel.....41 dollars a night is kind of ridiculous. 
Great place, great room, great location. Even though there was a big meeting going on (Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns) the only consequence for us was slow elevators. Ballroom is amazing, shops on ground floor a nice throwback. Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it. Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent. Definitly would return. 
My family and I have just had a two week holiday in Chicago, and we stayed for a week at the Hilton Towers. We had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute of our stay at this incredible hotel. The sheer size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and hospitable. If you prefer discreet modern boutiquey-type hotels, maybe this wouldn't be your thing. However if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz, you will be bowled over by this hotel. The place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby. Tons of celebs have stayed here over the decades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is fascinating. We got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place! 
I travelled to Illinois from the UK on business, and booked Friday and Saturday night at the Homewood Suites so that I could have a weekend in the city. The location was perfect, walking distance to Michigan Ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff, and literally 100 yards to the L (red line) for getting out to the surrounding areas. The room was great: not exactly 'wow' decor but clean and really well stocked. I was expecting a 'suite' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. It was actually a 3-room mini-apartment, with an open lounge/kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Two flatscreen TVs and a huge bed. Breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover(!), and the kitchen meant that I could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed. 
My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in Cleveland so we got a discount. The valets were really friendly, you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel. Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level. That also made finding the hotel tricky because I expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street. The lady at the front desk was friendly and informative. Our room was very clean. The fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants, storing and reheating food. The complimentary breakfast was great! They have real food such as eggs, bacon, french toast, cereal, bagels, juice, milk, and yogurt. The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue. They also have free WiFi. Overall, I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others. 
I stayed at this Hotel for 1 night. We just wanted to stay in downtown Chicago. This hotel is right next to John Hancock building. Walking distance to many shopping, restaurant, and everything else. From valet people to front desk people, they were all very friendly and helpful. The best thing about this hotel (other than the awesome location) is that all rooms are suites. You can choose 1 king or 2 double which will be inside the room and you get another sofa bed in the living room area. You get 2 TVs also. The roof top pool over looking Michigan lake was lovely also. 
Hi,Stayed here for three nights recently,From check in to check out all Staff members went out of their way to make sure everything was ok and if there was anything they could do to help us,directions,restaurants, transport,nothing was too much trouble,The dinner from monday to thursday 5-7 was a wonderful surprise,also the breakfast was more than adequet,Stayed on the 15th floor and slept soundly,Hotel close to everything for the tourist or business traveller.Restaurants and shopping all within 5-10 mins. 
everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money, they have excellent customer service, the employees there really cared about their guests, there was always coffee, tea, hot chocolate in the lobby, good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer, the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions, the room did the job, there was a kitchen, 2 flat screen tv's, and a pullout couch included, it was close to the "eL", but for us we found the buses to be more useful. I would recommend getting a pass, we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $14 which we got at jewel osco, not too far from the hotel, for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families, but us three girls didn't mind, so i would definitely recommend this place, it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels. 
I used to stay at the Homewood Suites all the time on business but have not stayed there on business since 2005 - since that time my company has been doing business in the suburbs instead of downtown. During December of 2007 and this year 2008 I did stay there a few days with my family and was greeted as if I never left. There is a lady named Connie who works the breakfast shift and she greets everyone and always remembers you from years before. A wonderful lady indeed - my wife even commented to me on the way to Chicago if that lady would still be there and would still remember and yes she does! Its a great place to stay. 
we stayed here in january when it was -20. but even then we enjoyed it so much we could not wait to get back. chicago is a great town to visit and the homewood suites is the place to stay, period. now we stayed from the 9/5/2009 to 9/5/2009 and enjoyed every day. (p.s. the weather was in the high 70s). to get back to the hotel, it was fantastic, it has everything you need and its write in the heart of the city. two seperate rooms were very handy as we had our teenage son. full kitchen, (laundry on 7th floor) seveal foodmarkets within walking distance, everything within walking distance. you wont need a car and at $42 for valet parking you wont want one. dont take my word for it , check it out you wont be disappointed. oh and did i mention free breakfast and dinner . job done. its a no brainer book now. p.s. theres also a beach within walking distance 
i was in chicago from september 17-22 for a convention.. my company booked this hotel for me. the hotel is centrally located , michican ave is less than a block away. perfect location! the suites are huge with comfy beds and a beautiful kitchenette. breakfast is the best... bountiful.. not just muffins and toast... i mean everything you can imagine...waffles, bacon, sausage , hash browns, toast, danishes, omelets, burritos, all freshly made... not artifical... really good. and clean .. also they have a free dinner... buffet.. excellent... mexican night, chinese night, american fare.. all included.. wine and beer also.. well worth the expensive price of $279 a night. a very classy and clean hotel.. i love chicago... will come again! 
This was a wonderful stay. The staff was extremely helpful , The rooms are especially large, and the fact they have a small kitchen makes everything a lot more easy. The breakfast and supper were excellent. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable - for instance, they have take-away plates you can take up to your room. the business center, gym and pool also make this my first choice next time in Chicago. 
I visited Chicago with my two teenage daughters. Homewood Suites is amazing. The complimentary breakfast and receptions offer so much variety. The hotel was within walking distance to many places to eat and shop. We got caught in a thunderstorm, and got soaking wet. I dried all our clothes in the dryer right in the hotel! The Homewood Suites was so much like home. The suite was very spacious and had everything we needed. The hotel had lots of brochures and suggestions for dining and activities. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Chicago is an amazing place and the Homewood Suites is the place to stay. I would definitely stay there again. 
Our third stay at the Homewood Suites Chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two. The staff are consistently friendly, polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door, servicing the rooms, managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk. They genuinely seem happy to be working here and can't do enough for their guests. The rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other (we didn't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy). The hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on Michigan Ave, or catching a bus or subway. There is a Jewel Osco and a Trader Joes each within a couple of blocks, which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc. My husband heartily recommends 'Binnies Beverage Depot' for a huge variety of beer. Now all we need is an excuse to return to Chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the Homewood Suites, because we wouldn't stay anywhere else! 
When making my reservation, I made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer Memorial Day. The staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate. The suites are very spacious, clean, cozy, and comfortable. Upon on arriving staff were friendly, willing to exceed expectations, and serve me with enthusiasm. The Hot Breakfast was delicious each morning. The beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other Chicago hotels. 
The location of this hotel was excellent as it is just beside the subway and the bus stop for the free trolley bus to Navy Pier is just beside the hotel. The room was very spacious. Kind of too big for a solo traveler. The view from the room was excellent and it was a great view to sleep at night. The bathroom was spacious too and the room has a big wardrobe. The kitchen has microwave oven and cooking utensils. Some of the cooking utensils were a bit dirty, probably because they had not been used for sometime. However, the microwave oven was very useful as I can heat up food to eat at night. You can easily walk to the magnificent mile by cutting across the shopping mall across the road. Do check out Pizzeria Uno which is near the hotel that serves the delicious deep dish pizza. For cheaper food, do check out the foodcourt at the shopping mall. The hotel also serves breakfast and dinner from Mon to Thur. I did not find the food that fantastic but it was pretty decent. I will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone going to Chicago. 
My family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July, 08. We had (3) 1 bedroom suites. Great Location in downtown Chicago. Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions. The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded. I recommend going early. The rooms were quiet and clean. I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying >2-3 days. We would stay here again. Parking is expensive, about $28/day. It is valet. The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $24/days so we did valet parking. The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly. This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites (3 different cities). I have had a great experience each time. 
Stayed over Memorial Weekend for 2 nites, 2 rooms. Great Hotel, we always love breakfast in morning,and drinks in even when applicable. Around the corner from magnificent Mile,and close to lots of restaurants. Staff was great, we even checked in early before noon,and other room available less than hour later. Fresh fruit was available to us,and bell guys are cool. Suites are on small side compared to other homewoods but no complaints here, house cleaning kept our room clean,and we felt safe! 
Our first visit to Chicago and I really cannot wait to go back. The hotel was in a great location and every member of staff we had contact with were exceptionally helpful. Particular mention should go to the door staff who were amazingly helpful. The room was clean, quiet and spacious, if only every hotel were like this. 
Just back from a business trip. The Homewood is in a great location just off the Magnificent Mile, includes a great breakfast, heavy hors d'ouevres for dinner with beer and all for a pre-paid rate of $129. Without a doubt the best value in Chicago for a long, long time. 
Perfect location, clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay. Its in an area with plenty of stores ( The Mile) and restaurants. Hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall I would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family, friends or on business. The subway to Wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door. 
This hotel was very beautiful. I went with a group of 4 friends and we had a blast. It was very centrally located and was close to all sorts of transportation. The Continental breakfast was magnificent! I didn't see much of the staff but all of the men at the front door were extremely helpful. 
I love the free breakfast and dinners on weeknights. The hotel is clean and nice rooms The pool needs some updating(but kids don't care) My friend and I took our granddaughters for a grandma grandaughter outing and this hotel was perfect 
I got a Sunday night stay for only $50 off of Priceline.com, so it would be hard to complain...but this was truly a great hotel, even if I paid double. The first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the Hyatt Regency Chicago is WOW. The lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant, plenty of couches,seats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains. You take the escalator to the concierge/directory/check in area. The hotel let me check in at 12pm (I had a 3pm check in time). I suggest you call ahead like I did so they know you are coming early.The women at the desk was friendly and when I requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me "I have a room on the 18th floor with a veiw of the river or you can go higher with no view". I thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that I wouldnt get stuck with a room with a view of a wall. The rooms are big (I had a doubles room) The beds were beautiful with great pillows,blankets,headboards etc. An Ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room. Great to plug in your ipod, listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring Chicago. The view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries. Another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. You simply look at the screen, click on your airline icon and following the instructions. I had my boarding passes in about a minute. Came in handy when I got to OHare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers. I was only in the hotel for 1 day, but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences I have had and I travel alot. It is a business hotel, but definitely a great choice for families and couples. Definitely would stay here again when Im passing through Chicago. 
We booked our room on Priceline, and got a good deal at around $100 per night. We stayed for the first 2 nights of our US trip so didnt use too many of the hotel's facilities The hotel is centrally located, just over the Chicago River from the shops at North Michigan Avenue, and around a mile from Navy Pier Our room was clean and comfortable, and on the 29th floor we had a good view of the city, and could just about see Lake Michigan (though the weather was very bad). The layout of the room is a little peculiar, with the bed facing away from the window, but over all we have no complaints about this hotel, and unlike some other reviews we were not disturbed at all by noise from other guests So, pros and cons: Pros: Helpful and friendly staff Clean and comfortable throughout Spacious rooms Large and airy public areas Starbucks and gift shop in lobby Cons A large hotel, so a long walk from the elevators to the front desk / lobby area 
I booked a room at the Hyatt through Priceline and was able to get a rate of $45/night! Can't go wrong with that! The rooms are nice, spacious, clean and contain all the amenties a traveler would need. I have to say that I have fallen in love with the Hyatt chain due to their customer service. I have stayed at a few of their hotels in different cities and the staff has always been extremely friendly, which you don't often see at other hotels. I used the self-check in machine, and the customer service person checked in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly. Then, when she saw that my room was not on a high level, she offered to have it changed for me so that I could have a better view. I would highly recommend this hotel! 
Great hotel in a wonderful location. I stayed in this hotel last weekend for one night before coming home and I loved it. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. Evidently popular and busy, the staff were still helpful. The rooms were lovely and spacious and clean. Bathrooms were clean, bright and spacious also. I'd definitely recommend this hotel too, it's close to the magnificant mile. 
Stayed here for 3 nights for a Bridgestone/Firestone convention. No complaints. Room was great with a beautiful view. Staff was very accommodating. Had drinks and appetizers in main bar. Fantastic! Great location. Yes it's a huge hotel as it's used for conventions but that didn't stop it from being a great place. 
My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the end of May, 2009. She came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city. We got a deal on this hotel through TravelZoos. $249/night stay for $99/night plus we got the full buffet breakfast. The room was wonderful. Extremely large King size bed with expansive sitting area. We are used to smaller hotels with little room to move. The bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows. No wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit (poor taps). We could have upgraded to river view for $20/night but chose not to. We enjoyed the room for what it was. 22nd floor looking south. The buffet breakfast was great. Lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs, non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please. Great to have breakfast included in night stay. Might be a bit dear to pay at $22/person. It was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast, coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal. Concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat, always informative and ready to provide maps, directions, multiple suggestions and even make the reservations. Cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs. Location was great. Blocks from El and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river. If in Chicago again, would not hesitate to stay here again. A swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it. 
Staff were friendly, room was well kept like a typical Hyatt location. Hotel is huge, with two buildings and over 2000 rooms. Good location, close to Michigan Ave and the subway. Parking is $48/day. Ouch! I bid on it on Priceline for $59. 
I stayed here for business and loved it. Got it for $93 inc tax on Priceline, an incredible deal for this hotel. If I wasn't on priceline I would expect to pay $200 per night (maybe more) for this location/level of service. It's in the heart of downtown Chicago, walkable to many locations. The lobby is very impressive, the room was very nice. No complaints at all, from check-in to check-out. I was alone so didn't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves. It was full of people all the time. I want to stay here when I come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city. 
I asked for a high floor away from the elevator and that is what I got. The room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district. 
On our visit to Chicago, we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown, within walking distance to most major attractions, such as Sears Tower, Magnificent Mile, Grant/Millenium Parks, etc. Subway & bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city . Overall the hotel was very nice, clean, and at a great location. Was in a safe area. Went to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both teams play. I love Chicago and would defenitely stay here again! 
Named my price on priceline. $50.00 Bucks. Hotel room was great. Clean, Clean and new. Fresh crisp sheets, comfortable bed, flat screen TV, clean carpet, nice bath, etc. Short distance to food and sightseeing. I highly recommend this property. Be prepared to pay over $40.00 per night to park. Hey, Its a hyatt. They also charge $5.00 for a bottle of water that is normally a buck. For a total of $100.00 nightly stay in Chicago this place is it just don't drink the bottled water. Happy Travels 
My friend and I stayed for just one night, and loved the hotel. It had an awesome water feature in the hotel, and great large bar. Like all Hyatts it had a very comfortable bed, lot's of pillows, and large bathroom. 
This comes a little late as I'm finally catching up on my reviews from the past several months:) A dear friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in late October 2007 for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town. This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. Parking, as is usual for Chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a Sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual I would think). No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through Hotwire, a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel. 
Stayed in a Junior Suite which was beautiful and spacious. It had the largest flat screen tv I have ever seen in a hotel (great excuse to catch up on some movies) The breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium which was nice. The service was top notch. Stayed in a lower floor in the East tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty. The Shed aquarium was a complete waste of time and money but the Field musium was amazing. Chicago remains tied with London as my favourite city. 
We arrived at 10:30 am on a Friday, and they had a room ready for us by 11:30 am, mind you check in is not until 3:00pm. We got our room on Priceline for $65.00 per night and stayed 3 nights. We were upgraded - for free - to a suite. I think I was so blown away by that, that I forgot to thank them at check-in! Our room was fantastic. It also had a wet bar and a fridge. The bathroom was quite large and had a nice sized closet with many hangers. I knew from previous reviews to not touch the mini-bar. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room was very clean. Every employee there went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 25th floor of the east tower and had a quiet room. Yes, you could hear people in the hallways, but only because they were rude and were yelling. These were not children, they were adults. I don't know why everyone complains about $48 for parking. This is Chicago and every other hotel we saw charged just as much, some without in/out privledges. We didn't use any of the restaurants or the health club. We tried to eat at the Corner Bakery but it was too crowded. Breakfast at nearby Houlihan's had a buffet for $9.99 per person. Also the grocery store behind the hotel is great. There is a 7-11 not too far away. I don't know why there are so many bad reviews on this hotel. Yes, it's a big hotel. If you don't want a busy lobby, don't stay in a 2,000 plus room hotel!! I loved the Hotel and would recommend it to anyone. Not one problem. Wasn't too busy for me. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. 
We paid $75 a night through Priceline, which is excellent for June. Our room had a fantastic view of the Hancock Building and the river. The room was large, clean and had a couch, easy chair and desk chair. The bedding was the newer 'non-bedspread' style, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large and, well, we were pleased with the room and the Hyatt in every way. We ate at the lobby restaurant, which is attractively decorated and was bustling with activity when we were there. We only got Cobb Salads, so I don't know if the food, in general, is good or not. The Cobb was so-so. Our only complaint was the $48 fee to park your car over-night and the $13 daily fee for the internet. Many places are offering free internet these days and I wish the Hyatt would hop on board with this concept. We hated to leave! 
Triple A rate with upgrade to view room was less than $200 which also included breakfast vouchers. Had a great view of river, lake, Wrigley Bldg. & Tribune Bldg. Most major restaurants, Shopping, Sightseeing attractions within walking distance. Large room with a very comfortable bed. 
Booked this on priceline for an insanely low price of $65 a night. The BF and I were amazed when we got there--the person checking us in was friendly and helpful to suggest some local nightspots and the room was gorgeous! A nice upscale, downtown feel and super comfy beds. We had a fabulous view from the 25th floor that inlcluded a sliver of Lake Michigan, a sliver of the Taste of Chicago crowds, and some friendly office workers in the builiding next door who waved to us a few times. Seriously. We had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay--which was fine with us. The hotel consists mainly of 2 towers and is like a huge, sprawling city inside. But we weren't there to stay in the hotel room the entire time...we like to get out and explore as much as possible. The location was fantastic. Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the rest of downtown. We walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab. I also highly recommend the Urban Cruise on the river (the entrance is right across from the hotel)--we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise Lake Michigan a bit too. Don't park your car here if you don't need to--it's very expensive. Park downtown or ditch the rental car--you won't need it anyway, you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab. Love Chicago and totally recommend this hotel! 
Check-in was fast, the room was perfect, and there were no problems. This is a standard big-city business hotel with every amenity imaginable. I got a very good deal for a one-night stay, but they made the money back from the exorbitant parking rate and the absurd access fee for wireless internet. If you are bored of the routine hotel fare, walk two blocks to Gourmet Pantry (155 N. Michigan) for a refreshing change. 
I stayed at the Hyatt for a two nights on a business trip. My room was oddly shaped to give a stunning view of the river and NBC Building. Both the room and the bathroom were spotless and the room had an air purifier which ran silently. The hotel was well staffed with individuals who were knowledgeable about both the hotel and the surrounding area. I would not hesitate to stay here again and plan to return with my wife for a weekend. 
Was slated for two nights in Chicago, June 12 - 14, 2007. I could onyl get the Intercon for both nights. I booked a handicapped room since that was they had left. After reading other reviews of the property, I decided to move it from two nights to one, and stay the second night at the Hotel Monaco. Of course, upon check-in, I was given a suite. Nice room, great linens, clean bathroom, and very quiet. Parking is really high ($48). I understand some peopel saying the rooms need to be updated, but everything was clean and worked well. At ,ost, the rooms were a bit dark. I had a late night drink at the bar, which was reasonably priced. i did not eat there, but the menu seemed pretty good, albeit with the typical hotel mark-ups to be expected. In all, I thought the place was everything I needed, and was very happy with the room, the staff, the linens, and the housekeeping. Much better than others have indicated. 
I stayed at the intercontinental during the last weekend in September for a "pleasure trip" -- the InterContinental was in a great location and the staff was excellent. The room was clean and comfortable -- and came equipped with a new LG flat panel tv. Had breakfast at Zest (hotel restaurant) -- a bit pricey but decent if you want a buffet. The hotel is in walking distance to millenium park, museums and the aquarium. There is also a lot of shopping - window shopping is best though, considering the sales tax is 9.5%! (and possibly raising to 11%) Great stay. I highly recommend it and would stay there again. 
We recently stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel for a week. The hotel was in a wonderful location and the service was great. We found all of the staff very helpful and prompt. We highly recommend the Intercontinental for any travel needs whether it be for business or pleasure. 
We got an awesome deal through Priceline for a Friday - Sunday stay at $75 for each night. The hotel is very centrally located on Michigan Avenue "The Magnificent Mile". You can walk to a ton of shops & there are plenty of restaurants handy as well. The hotel staff was very friendly, and the room itself was gorgeous. Very modern decor. Not drab & typical like most other chain hotels. If staying in Chicago we definitely will be staying there again. Price for valet parking overnight was insane ($42/day), but what do you expect in a big city. 
I stayed at the hotel one night. The hotel is excellent, comparable quality than Marriott and Sheraton, perhaps superior, but the location is definitely much better. Whatever your trip purpose is, business or leisure, you can drop your bags and take a walk on the Magnificent mile. Loved it! 
We stayed in the IC chicago for 6 nights from 26th Dec after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. We werent disappointed. We had 2 rooms opposite each other in the Historic tower. The rooms were spacious and very clean with good views towards the river and tribune building. We got a good rate on the rooms but did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was very expensive as was the Wifi at $17 per day. As the hotel is on the Magnificent mile there are plenty of place to eat including for breakfast. The starbucks in the lobby was a hit with the kids - very handy. I would definitely recommend the hotel. 
Spent two nights at the InterContinental on a business trip. This is a tremendous, towering hotel in one of the best locations in Chicago -- right on the Magnificent Mile and superbly convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area. My room was in the Historic Tower -- a 1920s Masonic Club which has been converted at enormous expense. The effort has been worthwhile. My room was very large and well furnished, with a beautiful bathroom which contained a separate shower cubicle. It had breathtaking views down Michigan Avenue. There is a superb recreation centre (with an impressive swimming pool) beautiful bars and a good restaurant, Zest, that serves a great breakfast. There is wifi in the rooms ($9.95 per day) and tea and coffee making facilities. No trouser press, but there is an ironing board and iron. The staff is friendly and anxious to please. I recommend this hotel in the strongest possible terms. It's expensive, but it will be difficult to find a better one in Chicago. 
The hotel is beautiful. It is an excellent location. There was a few minor issues. The hotel is clearly geared toward the convention and business crowd. There were charges for almost everything, although I did not incur any of these. Our room was a little small for the class of hotel, but not overwhelmingly small. Not a true complaint, but the elevators were very slow. My comparison was that we stayed in an equally aged hotel in a different city during our trip, and the Intercontinental's were significantly slower. That's it, no more little nit picks. The staff was excellent, the doormen being the highlight. The hotel bar was also very nice. The hotel was immaculately clean. I would definitely travel to this hotel again. 
My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was great. The check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question, and the bar served the best martini I have had in a while. The rooms were well decorated and spacious, although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door. The bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late. I would definitely stay here again! 
We became an Ambassador member just before spending Mother's day at the Chicago Intercontinental, and received a room upgrade to an exceptional room. Our Saturday night stay was the BEST $99 we ever spent (Mother's day special). The welcoming chocolate covered strawberries began the weekend on a high note; the concierge continued it by arranging a wonderful dinner (moderately priced) , and the great Sunday breakfast topped it all off. All in all, Mother's day in Chicago was Super. We loved it enough to be back for Labor Day weekend (another "package"). 
If you are looking for a hotel that is truly in the best location, the Intercontinental is it--right on the Magnificent Mile, next to the Chicago River, across from the Wrigley Building. My daughter and I stayed here for a getaway, and quickly were able to get to Milennium Park, shopping, Navy Pier, great dining, exploring festivals and strolling through beautiful areas along the lakefront and Chicago River. Check-in was easy and we were treated with courtesy throughout our stay. Maria, one of the concierges, was especially helpful in finding us a unique place to eat. The room was lovely and comfortable, although our tub didn't drain well. Just a wonderful stay! 
Stayed for 3 nights. booked via hotwire, upgraded to historic tower. Got a big room, with a nice view.Service was great. Valet parking was efficient, but you expect it for 53 doller/night. But the location was the best 
I was attending a training conference in Chicago and opted to book my own room thru one of the online discount programs rather than stay at the rather sterile and pedestrian hotel where the conference was being held. I booked 4 nights at the Intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location (an easy walk to the conference). From the lobby to the rooms, this hotel lives up to it's storied reputation. (The indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a Busby Berkeley movie!) And even tho' I was there for a conference, the hotel's location on the Mag Mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters, made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price. 
Stayed at the InterContinental for an entire week on business and for the most part a very elegant, convenient visit. Stayed in the historic tower. Very nice rooms, great view, attentive staff, convenient location just north of the Tribune Tower & the river, and nice fitness club at $16 for the entire stay. The only downside is I couldn't get over the feeling that I was being nickle & dimed: $10 a day for Wi-Fi, $6 bottles of water in the room, $26 mini-bottle of wine in the fridge, tipping multiple staff for carrying the same bags, etc. Their in-house restaurant Zest is Zagat rated though I'm not sure why. Within a 5 minute walk there are plenty of great restaurants with much better food than Zest. But, next time I need to be near the Loop I'd stay at the InterContinental again. 
I stayed at ICH Chicago for business in November of 2006 and loved it. As a Royal Ambassador member, they upgraded me to a beautiful junior suite with a separate living and working area and 2 bathrooms! My upgrade was in place upon arrival and a beautiful fruit basket was waiting for me on the coffee table. They even had a nice young lady escort me to my room. The suite was beautifully furnished and had an Art Deco feel to it. The only thing I regretted was that I only stayed one night. I will definitely stay here on my next visit. 
After reading some of the most recent reviews I'm really perplexed. I didn't know what to expect, but I was most pleasantly surprised. Just as all the past reviews, both negative and positive, have stated, you can't beat the location of this hotel. It's perfect. We had a big spacious room in the old tower. We avoided the expensive pitfalls of the hotel extras such as bottled water and items in the room fridge. The beds were great, the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly. Great martinis in the hotel bar. I really can't understand the negative reviews. I know you can't please everyone, but in some cases I simply don't believe their claims. I've traveled a lot and have stayed in plenty of hotels. This is a great hotel! 
Stayed here for two days while attending Lollopalooza music festival. One of the best locations in Chicago, on Michigan Ave near the Tribune and Sun-Times buildings. An easy walk or bus ride to many attractions. The King sized room was very nice, not large, but with a generous bathroom. Service was excellent throughout. Check out the awesome swimming pool, straight out of twenties. 
What a fabulous hotel! From its location directly on the Magnificant Mile and surrounded by the finest shopping, to the curtious staff and excellent restaurants and bars, this hotel is one of the best in Chicago. Our room was very clean and fresh, the public areas comfortable and the staff at the concierge and front desk very extremely helpful. This is the only place to stay to be in the cnetre of the action in Chicago. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 
We stayed at the Intercontinental for three nights last weekend. It is a located in a fantastic spot on the Magnificent Mile, right near the Chicago River and the NBC building. We had a double room in the main tower. The room was very clean and updated. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The negatives about this hotel is that you have to pay extra to use the fitness centre and internet access. Also, parking is high ($45 valet/day). Overall, we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel. We paid $90 on Priceline and felt that this was a reasonable price. 
We stayed here through Hotwire and got an amazingly low rate- $60 some odd dollars nightly for a 2 night stay last May. The room they had us in was small and had no view of anything except the wall of the other part of the hotel, but it was very clean, tastefully decorated and cozy. We had a great vacation, walking all over town until we ended up near the Planetarium which was where we then turned around and saw the skyline of Chicago and were just wow. So anyway, the hotel is great, the service was great, the room was very nice- I would recommend this hotel to anyone though I work at the front desk of a hotel myself and the previous person's comment about how she wasn't able to get adjoining rooms, well, internet sites don't guarantee things like that anyway- you've got to call the hotel direct and verify things like that. There's a note about that on internet sites as well- no room type/location is guaranteed. 5 stars out of 5 for this hotel. 
Dispite what other are saying, this was one, if not the best Hotel stay in Chicago I have had. I travel to the Big City about three times a year for pleasure and The James rates up with the best. I was upgraded and the staff made the stay worth my special weekend visit. I don't believe you will be disapointed. 
The James hotel is located close to everything in Chicago, the miracle mile, Pizza House Uno,Rush street, The Water Tower everything. We walked everywhere because everything was close by. The rooms are very modern and a little on the small side. But the bed was very comfortable, Very! The service is very good and the calls are answered professionally and nicely. All service was very fast and through. The lobby is a liitle small but that keeps the riff raff from hanging out in it, the bar service was good. The drink prices were high but what do you expect in a hotel bar. I got a great deal from leading hotels of the world for my stay of 3 days was just over $400.00 for a 5 star hotel that's cheap. Due to the location, price and service I may stay there again. But I think my next trip may take me to Trump's hotel in Chi Town. The James is a good stay . The doorman at the hotel are Great! Always pleasent, with a smile and very good service. 
I found this wonderful Hotel ! The location is awesome, just minutes away from all the shopping, Restaurants and Bars you could possibly want . I was in town for an interview, so I was really nervous . I ended up suggesting the Hotel Restaurant for my interview and they took such a good care of us, they made me feel so comfortable that I was hardly nervous at all. And the place was pack! The room was superb! Really cool design . I had a room they call an apartment, and it was fantastic! The natural light you get in this room is awesome, and I am very sensitive to dark places. They have a full bar in the room , which I was able to use to entertain my friends that night. I went to the gym for a little bit of exercise and I have to say I have never seen such a extensive facility in a hotel. All the staff made me feel like I was family. They were available to me at any time, and so friendly ! I will definitely be back for another stay. 
Room: I stayed in the 16thz floor. 2 double bed room. The room has a decent size. Equipment is state of the art. The Furniture are stylish. Room Size was very nice. I could have left my big suitcase opened throughout the stay (which rarely happens in most hotels ;)) 42" LCD Screen Complimentary WiFi in the room The bed and pillows are of extrodinary quality which provided an excellent deep sleep to me. Location Located quite central. Shopping streets are in reach of 5 minutes by feet. Midway Airport is in reach by cab within 30 minutes (~30 USD). Service - Spa and Fitness exists - though I did not use. - Restuarant (not used) - Business Center - Very friendly and helpful staff. (even printed our boarding passes at the reception) I do travel frquently, and do recommend this hotel for a business stay, as also for an overnight with friends going shopping, partying whatever in the city center of Chicago. Pricing was very moderate for teh standard being provided at a downtown hotel. 
My stay at the The James was perfect. My room was thoughtfully designed: the lighting, the storage space, the bar area, the eating nook and everything else in the room was purposeful and pretty to look at. The staff was friendly and and genuinely accomadating. The restaurant (Primehouse) echoed the above. Great service and one of the best steaks I've had in a very long time. 
We needed an extra night in Chicago after a gratus stay at The Penninsula and won a SkyAuction bid for The James @ $203. This is one of the nicest hotels that I've ever stayed in. Bathroom aside, we felt it equalled The Penninsula in comfort and level of service. I echo all of the superlatives previously written and would love to stay here anytime I'm in town. 
My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience. The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. It's in a quiet location, yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have, but it was elegantly appointed, spacious, and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. The service was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable. This was true from the doormen at the front, to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions, and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel, this goes for the room service as well. Dinner there was good, but not great. I mentioned almost flawless, as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel. It involved scheduling and was aggravating, as the hotel actively encourages its use. However, Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied, following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. Overall, we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits. 
We have just returned from a week at the James Chicago. The hotel is fabulous, very chic and chilled. The service is beyond compare. Check in and out were swift and painless. The Concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay. The hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in Chicago - voted by Chicago residents. We stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city. The room (a deluxe king) was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies, hairdryer, safe, tv, robes & slippers, a very interesting selection of minibar items (one of which was a real surprise!) including crisps/snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella! We also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with Kiehls products and a cosy little dining area. The ipod dock/CD/radio and complimentary chillout CD were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv. The super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary WiFi allowed us to plan our next day's activities from our bedroom. We were so busy touring around the city we didn't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab. The bar/lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more. Staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available. The barman mixes a mean mohito ! This hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e.g. The Virtual Tuck In service - basically a couple of PCs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they're away from home on business. Also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends. Next visit to Chicago I'll definitely be staying here and wouldn't even consider an alternative if The James can maintain these standards. 
took a weekend trip with my wife. got a great rate with valet included, paid a couple extra bucks for the larger room. staff was nice, workout facility was great. room has current decor, but was starting to show some wear. watch the concierge, she suggested a pretty bad restaurant to us. 
My significant other and I recently spent 3 nights at The James and on the last day I said, "I wish we could stay longer". That good! The room was immaculate and a very pleasant surprise from the moment you open the door. Everything is high tech. Plasma TV, CD/Radio, Projection alarm clock (love that so much bought one today). If you wanted room service you got it from David Burke and the mini bar and liquor selection was plentiful. They even have a four legged friend menu. The bathroom was pleasant with bathrobes/slippers and upscale products provided. The bed was the best in a hotel ever. Linens were crip, white and fresh. Maid service twice daily with turn down service. Safe in room, ice delivered, iron, hairdryer all top of the line. The filtered window shades blacked out the light and matched the modern decor. Mid-century style with funky chair/ottman, cubes and a table with nightstands gave us plenty of room and felt like comforts of home. The staff was courteous and accommodating. The library, free internet access, in room wifi were extras we didn't expect . Bar/lounge areas seems to be frequented by locals enjoying cocktails and appetizers in the lobby. Funky artwork. Location, location, location. The best place we've ever stayed not only in Chicago. Highly recommend. 
I believe I can not describe how amazing was our stay at The James. Service was impecable, from the door man to the front desk. Location could not be better. Yes, you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor, but, come on, you are downtown, what do you expect....Overall noise was not in a level to bother us. The only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm...PM not AM? Go figure... 
My husband and I wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago to celebrate our anniversary, and I had been looking at the James for awhile because it was attached to David Burke's Primehouse. From the moment I called to make my reservation, I knew this hotel understood what customer service means to a consumer and a picky one at that. From the pre-arrival dossier, to the special sweets from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note thanking us for staying at the James, this staff is well versed in the long lost art of customer service. The rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend. The walking distance to Michigan Av is a huge plus. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, the staff here is top notch! And David Burke's Primehouse is not to be missed! 
I LOVED this hotel. The room was so chic and trendy, the bed was comfortable, great slippers and robes. I love the Keihl's bath products in the bathroom. We went during my birthday weekend, and they had a card and plate with pastries waiting in the room. We got a great deal on a junior suite from Travelzoo, but when we tried to take another trip to Chicago, the deal was gone. I really recommend the hotel. I LOVED it. The ONLY problem we had was with the David Burke Steakhouse. The service was horrible, they switched our order with the table next to our's and the only compensation was they took off a $7 side dish we ordered (and they were nice enough to NOT charge us for the other side dish we DIDN'T get). DON'T go there. Go to the Lawry's accross the street. But stay at the James. (BTW- its not a 3-star hotel like the website lists- its at least 4-star) 
The James Hotel met and exceeded our expectations. A haven of cool, uncluttered comfort in a hot, crowded but congenial city. Located within steps of some of the greatest art, architecture, culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in North America, the staff of the James provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited. The check-in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm, restorative oasis. It is difficult to over-praise the friendly, attentive staff; this is a hotel that truly has its act together! The day before our visit ended, we experienced problems with the room's air conditioner. When the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem, we were immediately upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the Chicago skyline. We eagerly await the opening of new James Hotels in other cities. 
I stayed at the James in June, and I must say, it felt like I was in some ultra-swanky boutqiue hotel. From the uniforms of the staff.. which consists of a small J pin that they wear with nice suits and such, to the wonderful, comfortable beds, the James just makes you feel ultra-relaxed. The gym in the hotel was fantastic for a hotel gym, and the machines were all new and in fantastic condition. I really enjoyed the complimentary Kiehl's products as well as the soft, cushy beds with futons. Location-wise, it's just off Michigan ave, and it's close to all the shops and restaurants. I'd definitely stay here if I'm' ever back in Chicago. 
Stayed for 2 nights at The James, wonderful location 2 mins walk to Michigan Avenue with all the shops. Staff here were all incredibly helpful and genuinely friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. Rooms are huge and the beds the most comfortable I have slept in. Room was very clean, had separate seating area with sofa and chairs with a 42in flat screen tv. There was a bar area with stereo, mini bar and coffee maker. There was another flat screen tv in the bedroom area. Bathroom very good with complimentary shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. Hotel is also "pet friendly". There was even a large bowl of iced water and a barrel of dog biscuits at the front door of the hotel !!!. Pets even had their own options on the room sevice menu. 
I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and I can honestly stay that The James is tops. The service at the hotel is first class. The rooms are modern and very comfortable. The location is perfect within walking distance to all of the great sights and restaurants. Highly recommend to both business travellers and couples. 
Just returned to Seattle after a visit home to Chicago and I loved The James!!! Recently stayed at the Ritz at Water Tower and the Dana around the corner--both of which were great but The James was perfect. Secured the room through a package w/ American Express for a great deal so though the view wasn't great the space, decor and location can't be beat. Staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the gym was substantial and though I didn't try the restaurants/room service, the menus looked yummy. I've stayed in Chgo in that area on avg 1-2s/mo over the past three years and the James is at the top my list now. If you can get a good deal, I highly recommend!! 
The thing that makes this such an enjoyable place to stay is the staff who were all excellent and polite and the service was impeccable. The room was very clean, the beds were comfortable but it was a little small and the water in the bathroom was not very hot. Other than that it was a great place to stay. 
I try to stay at the James every time I happen to be in Chicago. There are other good choices in town, but nobody has what the James offers: superior service - aka class meets efficiency -, metropolitan design and comfort with an attention to details I found only at the W in Seoul, and what always plays a role meaning a convenient location ... Then they get to you with small unexpected touches that make the difference ie: I was about to take off and drive North, it was a hot July day...one of the staff members handed me a bottle of water. A small gesture. Unexpected and appreciated. The management AND the staff understand what we expect and more importantly, what we need. AND they consistenly execute against that. 
I was very happy with my stay at the Knickerbocker. The room were nice, and the staff was excellent. I was able to stay here for $80 per night thru Priceline. That was an incredible bargain in my opinion .. this hotel is very nice. It has an excellent location ... just off of Michigan Ave. All of the best shopping in Chicago can be found right around the corner. It's a great location ... very close to many great attractions. If there is any negative it would be that there is no swimming pool, but I think that is common with a lot of the older hotels in Chicago, I would definately recommend this place ... hopefully I will be able to stay there again in the future. 
My first trip back to Chicago in about 7 years was perfect! I chose the Knickerbocker as I had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to Michigan Avenue, Rush Street and downtown Chicago. I must say I was very impressed with the guestrooms! I had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a refresh from what I've seen in photo's posted on the reviews. The guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a historical hotel! The beds are wonderful -- I need to get a pillow top mattress at home! I used the Internet access with no issue and I LOVED the larger screen TV's. The shower is fun with the different types of shower heads you can choose. And the bathrooms are fresh with all new granite and tile. I'm anxious to get back to Chicago and it won't be 7 years from now! I would highly recommend this hotel -- fantastic guestrooms, location and staff! I've added some digital pictures of my room as they are completely different from the one's I saw on previous reviews with the new renovation. 
We absolutely loved the Knickerbocker. Now, if you expect your hotels to be cookie cutter comfortable, forget this place. If Holiday Inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs, the Knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city. The location is great, the hotel bar is cozy and classy, and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in Victorian mansions. For the price, you simply can't do any better than this in downtown Chicago. 
Other reviews complain about the small rooms. For a major city, we found our room quite comfortable with a king bed and really nice furnishings. One feature we liked is the ability to open the window. The Knikerbocker is a small boutique hotel right off Michigan Avenue in the best area of Chicago. The staff was friendly and helpful. For the $116 we paid on Hotwire, we could not have found a better room in downtown Chicago. 
We were greeted by staff with excellent customer service skills. Our room was such a pleasant surprise, from the flat screen TV, the full size shower with rain showerhead & hand held shower wand, the wall attached toilet with flushing options (on the wall), the comfortable bed, the lovely lighting options, etc.. The size of the room was snug, and very comfortable, as would be, in a historic hotel. It was also quiet, and I know that the hotel was sold out. My sister was in the room next door. We did not hear her TV. We also loved walking less than a block, to the shopping and restaurants on North Michigan Avenue. 
We stayed here as an alternative spot for a friend's wedding. The price was about 50% to 65% of what it costs to stay at similar hotels in the area. First the minuses. 1.) The standard rooms are small. if you want a little more space you might want to upgrade. 2.) Since the hotel has been recently rehabbed you can see some of the stuff that the covered or painted. 3.) There really are no views from the hotel. Now the plusses. 1.) The shower is AWESOME. Probably one of the best hotel showers I've seen. Rain shower with wand, great pressure and the enclosure didn't leak like a lot of these shower stalls do. Very nice. 2.) The fixtures and finishes in the rooms were top notch. Very modern and clean. 3.) The bed was great. Better than some hotels that promote their beds. Great nights sleep. Overall. This is a great space for a trip where you are not going to be spending much time in the room. If you were in town for a conference or for work where you will need to spread out your stuff it might not work. Anyone else should really like the experience. All I care about when I travel is having a nice bed and a good shower to relax in after a long day. If you are the same this is a good spot for you. 
We stayed 2 nights at the Knickerbocker and could not have had a better stay. The hotel has recently renovated there rooms. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful from Dave and Cora at the martini bar to Julie at the front desk who help out with an upgrade for us. The hotel has everything you need for your stay and is close to all the fun that Chicago offers. Our pick for THE CITY is the Knickerbocker. JOHN and JUDY. 
The Knickerbocker hotel is fantastic! It's an old hotel with updated rooms - so you get the old-timey charm and fresh comfort all at once. The hotel has a fabulous location. It's a one minute walk to the Cheesecake Factory and Bloomingdales, and about a 5 minute walk to Einstein Bagel Company (the best bagels and cream cheese EVER), Macys and Saks. This location can't be beat. You're at one end of the magnificent mile, so it makes for easy strolling, as you don't start in the middle and then backtrack. The hotel staff are super helpful and friendly. Checking in and out was very smooth, and the concierge (Cheryl) was amazing. She booked all our dinner reservations and activities for us, and recommended an incredible restaurant called Carmines which was a 5 minute walk. It was the greatest italian restaurant I have ever been to, and I can't recommend it more. The rooms are small but not too small. We had a beautiful big samsung flat screen, cordless phones, a rain shower, ample clean towels, and beautiful marble countertops. The hotel rooms have european charm to them and made me feel like I was at a 5 star hotel in Europe. The beds are very comfortable and the duvet is soft like butter. The only complaint I had was that housekeeping woke us up at 8:30 one morning when the knocked on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on. When we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit miffed. The issue was corrected, though, and it didn't happen again during our 4 night stay. The hotel has some unique items on their room service menu - ie - grilled cheese with mini tomato soup for dipping. Very cute. Their late night menu, however, is lacking. It would have been nice to see some soup on there. That being said, I RARELY order from room service when on vacation, so I really don't see that being a big deal. Overall I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. I think we paid about 130 a night and I would say it was worth far more than that. We had a wonderful experience and I truly look forward to staying there again....wouldn't stay anywhere else! 
Just got back from three nights at the Knickerbocker. Went up to Chicago for some last minute Christmas shopping. Hotel is in a great location. North end of Michigan Ave. about half a block away. Staff was very nice and professional. Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful. Granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets. We were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room. Good size room, with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed. Bathroom was somewhat small. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day. Did not eat at the restaurant Nix, but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar. Overheard comments saying the food was very good. Drink service at the Martini Bar can be slow. Martinis run $9 and up. Very good drinks and they don't shy away from the liquor. Valet parking was $35 a day with in/out priviliges. Overall a great stay. Would definately stay at this hotel in the future. 
My wife & I celebrated our anniversary at the Knickerbocker & could not have been treated better. Before we were out of our cab, our bags had been loaded on a cart & we were walked into the hotel by a doorman. The rooms were well appointed & the entire hotel staff was very friendly. This is a prime location for shopping, sightseeing or nightlife. 
What a quaint, warm and friendly place to stay! Very accomodating ..had 2 dble beds and bathroom was fine....a bit small compared to USA hotels....but compared to european travel...the place was palatial! Would def. stay here again. Location is great too! 
Stayed there three nights from 4/17/09 through 4/20/09. Chechecked in about 9:15 AM. Had to wait about 15 minutes because of specials requests I had made. Room was quiet, and comfortable. Marked improvement over last time I stayed there (about 5 years ago). The renovations were great, and maintained the old time charm of the hotel. 
This hotel was magnificent! Not only was it a mini palace, but the staff was polite, helpful, and professional. In an e-mail I received before we left for Chicago, the concierge, Les, offered to get us tickets, directions, reservations to anything we'd like to see/do. He also got us an upgrade on our room, and when someone rudely butted in line as we were registering, the registry person said they would upgrade our room just for that. And so we were granted a beautiful suite complete with king size bed and jacuzzi. The bed and the linens were so comfortably both of us slept late every morning! 
If you have not tried the Millennium Knickerbocker for a stay in Chicago, do it now! We have stayed (and enjoyed) at the Drake, Intercontinental and others, but we always now come back to the Knickerbocker. Why? If "Charlie" the doorman is on duty and you pull up, he will welcome you. He'll probably ask your name. Why? Because he wants to call you by your name every time he will see you during your visit. Somehow he even lets the other employees know your name and all of a sudden, doorman, receptionist, bellman, waiter are referring to you by name. The employees are what makes this hotel. Yes, it has everything to offer like all hotels, but the others don't have the fine people (including the cleaning staff) these folks have. Try it, you will like it. We look forward to our next visit already... 
I love this hotel. It is one of the best that I have stayed in. The lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable. The made services was terrific. No matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back. I asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly. That is what I liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly. I was there with my daughter for a girl's weekend from Thursday - Sunday. Everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc. was wonderful. I can't say enough good about this hotel. Yes the bathroom was small, but I wasn't moving into the room. I was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway. I will definitely stay there again 
We really enjoyed our brief stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker! From the front desk personnel and bellmen to the housekeeping staff and bartender, everyone we met was helpful and welcoming. Our 11th-floor room was clean and beautiful, and the view looking north to the Drake Hotel and apartments across the street was nice. The in-room coffee service was appreciated, too. There isn't a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletries, but I'd still take a room in a beautiful older hotel with character over a spacious-but-cookie-cutter room any day! 
OK, we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating. I can't believe the bad reviews. I got a priceline deal, and I still got a fine room, clean, up-to-date furnishings (OK a little traditional for my taste) and smoke free. Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews. I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth. Here it is from my point of view. Both rooms on 10th floor. Regarding the size of the rooms. We had two rooms. One was a 2 double bed room. It was about 20' x 15'. Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies. The furniture, bathroom tile, shower (no tub), wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years. A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV, coffeemaker, ice bucket, and mini-bar. Three separate levels (TV, ice/coffee, and minibar) The other room was called "Queen executive". This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence, sofabed, two TVs and terry bathrobes. Also about the same size but different configerations. One TV faced the bed, other in the three level cabinet, the sofabed. Smoke in the lobby. There is a bar to the right of the entrance. It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door. No smoke smell in no-smoking rooms. Cost of rooms $75 on priceline plus taxes. Very good value one block from N. Michigan Ave. Only complaint. Concierge said that the free trolley didn't go down Michigan Ave to Field Museum/Museum complex when in fact it does. Was this ignorance? or trying to throw more business to taxi? Either case, not good. He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter....which is clearly incorrect. 
My wife and I had to stay downtown for event that we were attending at the Drake Hotel. I have stayed at the Drake before and while it is nice, it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price. We opted to walk across the street and stay at the Millenium instead. I know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and I have to say they have done a great job. This place used to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to Chicago on a college roadtrip (I did). But that is not the case any more. This property is directly across from the Drake Hotel and for 1/2 the price you get their great location with a newer (albeit smaller) room and every ammenity you would expect from a 4* hotel. The rooms are tastefully decorated (Asian influence w/flat screen tv) and the bed is very comfortable. The bath is small (no tub), but very clean and the shower is great. You are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when visting Chicago, so the room's size is not a big deal. (It works well with a couple, but a family of four may be a bit cramped.) The service was attentive and friendly and the location can't be beat. I would definitely stay here again, but the next time I would leave the car at home ($49/night parking is a bit steep). 
I loved this hotel - fabulous old building but with first class modern amenities. Great location, as it's so close to both lakeshore and city. Chicago is such a walkable city, so this was a superb base. The staff were just lovely - so very friendly and efficient. The room was wonderful - very, very comfortable and exceptionally clean. Great chair. Great coffee. Lovely bathroom with a huge, absolutely fantastic shower. It was also extremely quiet. That, and the best bed ever, meant I slept so well and since I was there for a week, that was very important to me. Yummy martinis at the Martini Bar. I will most definitley be back! 
I was lucky enough to get a "4 star" hotel off of Priceline for $70 - I was luckier that I got the Knickerbocker! From check in to check out the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms are small but cozy. After reading the reviews from other guests I was somewhat scared of what I would find - they must have stayed at a different hotel. I am a very frequent traveler and felt that the rooms and the hotel met the "4 star" rating. Yes, the rooms and bathrooms were small, but what historic hotel in a big city isn't? The decor and quality met my expectations. The lobby and bar were very inviting. Overall, I would stay here again and again. 
This is a great hotel! From the doorman who greeted us as we arrived, to the young man at the reservation desk to the young woman serving complimentarily wine, everyone was very friendly and helpful. We were "strangers but for a minute!" The room was extremely clean, well appointed and we had a pretty view of the Chicago River, especially enjoyed from the large window seats. Loved the purple polka-dot paper on the toilet paper roll! Hallways were large and quiet. The restaurant next door, South Water Kitchen is very nice too. The location is in walking distance of the theatres, parks, the river (take a cruise), Michigan Ave. It's ideal. The only negative is that the concierges were not nearly as friendly or inviting as the rest of the staff nor were they very helpful. For a self-sufficient traveler, you wouldn't really need their services (although it is nice) but for someone coming to Chicago for the first time, a concierge can be very helpful. I would definately stay at this hotel again and would recommend it. 
Hotel Monaco is in a really great location, only a block away from the Miracle mile and a couple of blocks from Millenium Park. Sears Tower is also well within walking distance and if you don't mind walking you won't have a problem walking to Greek Town and Lincoln Park (we did). The daily, complimentary, wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out. If you can, leave your car behind, you won't need it and the parking is quite pricey, which is not very surprising considering the location. Everything was clean, fresh and modern and the staff very helpful. The only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around "the loop" was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid's supply room so it was quite busy in the morning. 
I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned. We stayed in room 1112, King with River View. No noise and very comfortable.The price was a bargain at $191 a night. I would stay here again. The "L" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel. It's a $2 ride - no need for a $40 taxi ride. 
This was my first time in Chicago and wanted a hotel that was in a good location. This definitely fit the bill. I could walk to all the places I wanted to see - very close to Michigan Ave and the Magnificent Mile. About a 15 minute walk to the Art Institute. The hotel staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. There was coffee in the lobby every morning, that was very welcome. The room was comfortable and clean and fairly quiet. I could hear the train and some traffic from the street (considering the location, this wasn't bad and didn't affect my ability to sleep or relax). I would definitely recommend this hotel - a gem!! 
My initial thought of the hotel was, this place is just ok, I didnt look up any reviews as I was staying there with 2 other friends. I was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room. Views were good, its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located. I'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is HUGE. I love all the space they have. Flat tv, traditional seating and I admired the fabric-based headboards. Those are very nice! Walking distance to restaurants were convenient. I'm a highly frequent traveler to Chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives. In any event, I'd recommend staying at the Monaco again! 
We wanted a nice place to stay the night after dinner, theater, and my daughter's 21st birthday. This place certainly fit the bill. It was convenient to everything including the SouthShore Railroad station. The staff were all friendly. Their was a small wine reception in the lobby in the evening and Starbucks coffee in the morning. Ryan, the concierge, ordered flowers for my daughter and had a nice bowl of Hershey Kisses waiting for us when we arrived. We were upgraded to a suite and although they forgot to make up the sofa bed, they came promptly to get it set up when we called later. The window seats were beautiful as well and I enjoyed drinking my coffee in the morning and reading a book. 
Stayed at the Monaco on my way skiing at Easter & loved it. Staff were helpful & friendly, room was huge with fantastic view of the river. Central location, 5 min walk to the EL. Adjoining Restaurant/Bar, great food & service. I have stayed in more expensive, supposedly better, hotels in Chicago, but this is the best. Thanks Monaco, I'll be back. 
Having had a great stay at the Monaco last Fall with friends, I was disappointed (initially) to arrive on Saturday with husband and find that they didn't have our Quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for Sat. eve. BUT they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following: found us a nice room at the neighboring Swissotel and paid for it! Gave us cab fare to get the 4 blocks over there. Paid for our valet parking $33 that eve. So naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for Sunday eve (when they did have room), we said yes. When we returned, they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our $139 quikbook rate! Now that's what I call a recovery!! 
We had a king deluxe room for 2 nights. We reserved the room through the hotel website with AAA discount. We paid $180/nt. We enjoy boutique hotels, as they have so much more personality and personal service. This hotel was no exception. Every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful. The room was clean, well decorated, spacious and quiet. We were offered at check-in a room with a view, but warned it was across from the elevator, so we decided to take the quiet, large room with no view. The location of the hotel was perfect for us, we saw Wicked while in Chicago and had no problem walking to the theater. We also walked the Magnificient Mile and found the location perfect (we like to walk). We had drinks at the hotel restaurant both nights which was a pleasurable experience. We ate room service for breakfast each morning, and the food was good and the portions were quite large. We would definitely stay here again. 
After reading the reviews on this hotel, I decided to book my stay for July 4th weekend here and I am glad I did, this hotel is absolutely beautiful. Our suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows. I do have 1 complaint. The bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great, but other than that I loved it. I would definitely stay there again. 
Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in August and loved the hotel. Enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour, and the accomodations were quite nice (our beds were very soft and comfortable). We had excellent views of the river from our rooms. The location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town, with easy access to public transportation nearby. My friends actually received the goldfish upon request, which they enjoyed. Some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above, but it was minimal. Price seemed very resonable to us for the location. Will certainly return to the Windy City and plan on staying here again. 
Our room was on the third floor so there was some street noise - but it certainly didn't spoil our 4 nights in this lovely hotel. Wine tasting evening went down extremely well after a day seeing the sights of the city!! Our goldish was called Oliver - nobody could believe we had our very own goldfish in our room!! All the staff were really helpful and welcoming, making our stay here very relaxing and comfortable. Would certainly recommend this hotel. 
Very pleasant front staff, wine in the evening in the lobby, large rooms, great rates, and free Internet for those that are members of the loyalty program. Overall an excellent value. Close to the El for those coming in from either Midway or O'Hare airports. 
Stayed at the Monaco for a romantic weekend getaway and it was simply fantastic. Very convenient for walking to museums, shopping and park nearby. The room has a great box window that you can sit in and enjoy the view. We also requested a goldfish which was a pleasant surprise and added to the charm and uniqueness of the hotel. Helpful staff, wifi, Aveda products, decent restaurant downstairs for brunch, easy to get a taxi and nothing beats the location. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel, for business or pleasure. 
After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed. I booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens. The location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. - minutes walk to the El, Millenium Park, the Theater District and Shopping. The room was clean, a little larger than standard and nicely decorated. We had window seats in the room with a view of the river. There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening. To top it off, the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area. 
A friend highly recommended this hotel and we couldn't have been happier! It was wonderful ~ my husband and kids were already planning our next trip there before we had even left the hotel. The kids loved the goldfish in the room and thought the window seats were the best. 
I want to recognize so many people who were exemplary in their service. 1) Sylvia Rollins, Head Concierge. I wanted a fairly last minute reservation at MK restaurant. I spoke with Sylvia on the phone just a few days prior to arrival and within 15 minutes had the desired reservation. 2) Ryan Lettier, Concierge, provided us detailed information on the architectural cruises. Our morning cruise ended up being cancelled by the tour operator and Ryan provided a late check out time to cover us until we could get back to the Monaco. 3) Turndown service was provided as requested and housekeeping in general seemed to be at a high standard 4) Even the bellman went out of their way to ask if we knew how to get the train etc when leaving the hotel. The rooms are tastfully furnished in that whimiscal Hotel Monaco feel. Beds and bedding both very comfortable. The complimentary happy hour and morning coffee/tea service were both very utililzed by the hotel guests. 
My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 5 days in October, 2007. I cannot begain to tell you how great this place is. The service was impecable and the room was fantastic. Huge window seat to look over Chicago. It was great. The wine reception in the evening was a special treat as was the morning coffee service in the lobby. This was our first trip to Chicago and I hope not our last. I will definately stay at Hotel Monaco again when we return. We booked our room through a safety convention web site. 
While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before, this was my husband's first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time. Well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful. The warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing. Unfortunately we missed the wine hour. One thing that realy impressed me is that b/c of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late -- Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation. 
We loved this hotel and would definitely come back. Initially we weren't given a goldfish, which was disappointing, but then we left a tip for the housekeeper, and she rewarded us with one. We had fun sipping wine and playing Wii in the lobby every afternoon. The staff were quite friendly and helpful, even printing our boarding passes for us. Our room was very comfortable, with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. At first we were worried about noise, since our room was next to the elevator, but we hardly heard it, and didn't notice any street noise either. The hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated, well-lit, and ideally located. 
We stayed at the Omni between Christmas and New Year's in 2008 just to get away for a few days. We found it through web deals and got a penthouse suite very cheap. So this year we checked online just a day or so after Christmas and the deal was there again. It also included parking at the great price. Huge suite overlooking downtown Chicago. Best location to walk EVERYWHERE. My 12 and 11 yr olds loved swimming at night and the chocolate cookies on their pillows. Can't wait to go back. 
Just back from 5 night stay at Omni and would thoroughly recommend it. Staff bent over backwards to assist in anything, no matter how minute. Great location on magnificent mile and lots to do there both for adults and my 10yo daughter. If i had to find a fault it would be the extra charges, taxes etc for room service, bar and restaurant, but where is cheap these days? Would definitely recommend it, especially for families. 
I stayed at the Omni for one night following a business meeting at another downtown Chicago hotel. I was completely impressed by the service; all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding. I checked in quite early (no problem) and was efficiently checked in. My room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener (the ONLY negative from the entire stay), which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows. I don't generally require much during my hotel stays, but suffice to say the doorman, housekeeping, the night manager and bartender at 676, the day waiter at 676, and the concierge were amazing - I never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything. The room was very comfy and the amenities were superior. One very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenex/coffee paraphernalia. One wastebasket would make all the difference. All that said - what a great hotel!! Thanks, Omni - I had a great stay! 
My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite. When we arrived, she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested--and more. Our suite had a partial view of the lake!!! And, we were able to check in early. The service at this hotel is incredible. Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had. The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel, very near to Michigan Avenue. Housekeeping was prompt and thorough. We really couldn't have asked for a better hotel. We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there. 
We stayed at Omni Chicago for 2 nights in early July (July 1-3). The reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on TravelZoo. We got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for food&beverages. I also signed up for their loyalty program, which was so worth it. I was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second-class guest because of the price we paid. But I was totally wrong! They treated us extremely well. Before our arrival, I got an email asking if we needed anything. So, I asked for a fridge to store the baby milk. And they arranged it for us without charge :) We arrived late on Thursday night. Our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge I requested. We were given a corner suite on the 10th floor...very nice room...comfy bed. My husband was really wowwwww!!! The bed was made ready for us - both in the bedroom and the sofa-bed (we didn't use the sofa-bed though). We got a high-speed Internet as part of the loyalty program. All staff were friendly and helpful...front desk, valet parking, bell boy, room service, concierge,... everyone! We used the voucher for room-service breakfasts both morning. The first day was great. Food was great, and quick. We also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program. We ordered OJ and hot chocolate. They both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning. But we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible. It tasted like left-over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate :( Also, we ordered Belgian waffle for our breakfast, which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries...but we got a plain waffle. So, we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those. This is why I didn't give "5" for service. However, I reported these issues to the front-desk when checking out, and the front-desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal. Another thing is that it's quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor. We could hear siren going on & off during the night. But this is out of the hotel's control though. And I would say that it didn't bother us at all. My baby could sleep very well. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely consider Omni for our next trip to Chicago. 
Great hotel in heart of Chicago for business or pleasure. Rooms are recently upgraded and very modern and large. Flat screen TVs, marble baths, all rooms are suites, great desk, kitchenette, comfortable bed, free wireless internet... everything you could ask for. Location is easy walk to Magnificient Mile and lots of great restaurants. Staff is friendly and helpful. Short cab ride to Loop. 
At the last minute, my son and I decided to take a quick trip to Chicago to see the Cubs. After checking Priceline I decided to book the Omni because of the great price for airfare and hotel. We arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was ready(I had called ahead and requested early arrival).The front desk treated us like we were there best customers-very friendly and accomodating. The room was wonderful with all the modern conviences you would expect in an upscale hotel. The room was spotless and the bed was VERY comfortable. There was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous review-maybe those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their room!!!We then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch. Our service was great as was the food. We also tried several restaurants around the Omni-all within walking distance. The service, cleanliness and location of the Omni were incredible. We will definitely go back. 
I'll keep it short. My wife, daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel. Location: It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave.), so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do. Hotel: The hotel itself is very clean, as were the rooms. Maid service was excellent, including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service (I think they missed a night). Service: Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind. They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile. Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room (sometimes chocolates on our pillows). They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it. There was no shortage of people to ask things. My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get. They shouuld have more than one, or longer hours. Other: We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good, and well attended, appointed. They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet. The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids. It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking. Pool and changing areas were spotless. Room: Clean, sunny and spacious. Probably over 400 sq. ft. - 2 TVs, couch, desk, chairs - all in perfect shape. The windows open for some fresh air. Pillows were pretty comfortable. With all aspects considered, I think this was an unbeatable value! I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend. I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel. It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there. Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number. The airlines have cornered the market on that. 
We arrived at the Omni on 2nd September for a 6 day stay. I took ill when I left the plane after travelling from Manchester so I saw more of the room than I anticipated. I couldn't go out for 4 days. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was large and very clean. What more could you ask. We had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested. I managed to go to the 5th floor to see the sun terrace (outside the gym) Having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit grim. A few sunbeds on a concrete floor. There was also noise from an air conditioning unit. It could do with a bit of cheering up. What I saw of Chicago was very pleasing, it has something for everyone. Would I go back to the Omni? yes I would. 
We have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite. Location is superb, staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying. Cornell, at the front desk, is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge. We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program, high speed internet is gratis, as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing. Bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains! We have never had a bad stay at this hotel. 
Got a good deal on a weekend pacage in this Hotel and have to say it is the nicest stay I have had in more than a dozen business trips to Chicago. All rooms are Suites, staff is friendly and professional, Restaurant is out of this world and all the extras like a great health club, turn down service, complimentary morning beverages delivered to room and on and on. Room was very clean and every need was attended to without feeling intruded on. Will definately stay here again. 
I stayed at the Omni with a Band that what in town. The room was amazing. Just walking in, the hotel was gorgeous. I have no complaints. Prompt Room service, Friendly front desk. Many shops, beautiful fountin. Just an all around great hotel in a great City. 
My wife and I travelled to Chicago and really were treated like royalty by the hotel staff! (My brother and his wife also stayed during this period.) The front desk staff, the concierge, the Star Bucks server, the restaurant, the lounge servers . . . all were wonderful! The rooms were spacious and the flat screen tv was really great! The bath room was a real plus ... it was huge and had everything one desires. Great view from 20th floor to Michigan Avenue below! Overall, great stay and highly recommended! 
Just got back from 2 days up in Chicago shopping with girlfriends. First time I have stayed at the Omni. I did so because I saw a $129.00 rate that included $25.00 of free food on Travelzoo. The three of us (55 year olds) all stayed in one suite with 2 double beds and a VERY comfortable pull out sofa. We had plenty of room. Food in the restaurant was great, service was outstanding from everone we came into contact with, early morning delivery of free coffee, juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat, time of movies, shopping areas, etc was really helpful. Need I mention the outstanding location? Simply the best! We all decided that the Omni is our new favorite hotel. 
We just returned from our first trip to Chicago and stayed at the Omni. I read many reviews on trip advisor and picked the Omni based on its wonderful reviews and they were right on. The location, staff, rooms, amenities, etc were all wonderful. Huge thank you to TA members who suggested signing up for the preferred member program. We did that before we left and received complimentary beverages in the morning and newspapers among other perks. I loved being woken up to fresh orange juice and the Chicago Tribune newspaper. We were in room 816 which was perfect. Corner suite with two out of the 3 sides of the rooms being windows with a great view. The room was huge with a gorgeous king bed and great living area with plasma TV. The bathroom amenities were wonderful. I loved soaking in the tub with the mineral salts that were provided. The turn down service was great as well. We would come back to our room with relaxing music playing and our bed ready for us. We ate at their restaurant twice and the breakfast buffet was delicious. The blueberry muffins were the best I have ever had. Everything was so fresh and prepared perfectly. The staff at the Omni is so accomodating. Everyone is always smiling and asking you how your stay is. Have to thank the concierge Melissa and Curtis. They were both so helpful with great dining suggestions and maps for everything we wanted to do. I also used the gym during my stay and it was great. All the machines were top notch and each treadmill has a lcd TV attached. And the gym itself had two plasmas. They also had cold lemon water for you after your workout. I am a stickler for cleanliness and it was sparkling every morning. It really was a fantastic stay at the Omni and we would never stay anywhere else. I also wanted to mention we never heard any construction while we were there. Everything was quiet and we both slept wonderfully on the big comfy bed. Thank you Trip Advisor for another great trip suggestion! 
I stay at this hotel 2 times a year on business and LOVE it! The staff are great, the rooms are spacious and clean, and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave. Plus if you sign up for Omni Select Membership (for free) you get free wireless internet access. 
This a great property, excellent location and wonderful staff. Everyone was very accommodating and polite. The room I had was on the 23rd floor and was like a suite, with a living area and a bedroom. The living room was spacious, with a plasma TV, a desk and a couch. The beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality. In the closed they placed an umbrella, which came in handy, it rained the whole time I was in Chicago. The internet connection is $9.95/24hrs. Great place, I will return for sure. 
This hotel is the perfect location for downtown Chicago shopping. The only thing is the pool is extremely small - it is indoors, but looks much larger on the website. 
The Omni is in a fabulous location on Michigan Avenue. Within just blocks are all types of stores, including Saks, Nordstroms, H&M, Filenes Basement, Macys, La Perla, Apple, Bloomingdates.....I could go on and on! The room itself was fabulous. Comfortable, nice big flat screen tvs, nice sized bathroom. They charge for Wi-Fi, but we found if we clicked yes on joining their guest program we could then go from the sign-on screen right to our email without actually completing the registration. We got this hotel for $214/night through Priceline and felt it was a terrific deal! 
The Omni Chicago really delivers on all fronts, from the spaciousness of the rooms to the helpful staff to the prized location on Michigan Avenue. While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality, the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the "standard" room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all, a great property! 
Stayed here for 5 nights while visiting Chicago for the first time. The location is great, the hotel has been recently renovated and our room was very spacious with two bathrooms. The lobby is a great place to chill and have a drink. Didn't eat in the restaurant but there are a few good ones nearby and we were beside The Art Institute, Cultural Centre & Macys. Staff were friendly. Would recommend it as a base to tour the city. 
My wife and I spent several nights here on a getaway excursion. I didn't choose it -- Priceline gave it to me for $70. If I'd paid the book rate, $175, I'd have been less pleased. No troubles with checkin. Very small room but bed was clean and comfortable. Starbucks in the lobby was a godsend. I'd read horror stories about the staff but they seemed friendly enough. For $70, it's a steal. For its online face value, not so much. Will definitely return if can get similar price. 
Had to bring my new puppy with me on a business trip and stayed at the Palmer House. The service was wonderful, staff was very friendly towards dog owners, even stopped to tell me how nice my dog was. Easy access to red line from Midway. Valets were prompt at retrieving car (they recommended calling down in advance we did and the car was there waiting). 
Just returned from a week in Chicago with the family. This hotel was perfect for us. Location is great, kids loved the pool as a place to wind down after a day of museums, touring, ball games, etc. We checked in through Hilton Honors Desk as opposed to the regular check in line. Even though our reservations were through priceline at a reduced rate, they gave us a pick of the the rooms. The room had a large closet which helped with the amount of gear we had with us. Used valet parking which was hasselfree. We had a great experience and would stay there again. 
My wife and I stayed for 2 nights and loved it. Our stay was booked for us by Virgin Atlantic when we booked our flights from London to Chicago. We were not quite sure what to expect but were reassured by the Hilton brand name. In the event we found that the airline knew what they were doing when they suggested this hotel. On arrrival we got a warm welcome and the check in was quick and efficient. The interior of the hotel is spectacular and looks like has been refurbished to reflect the decor as it would have been when it was built. The room we were given was a good size with 1 Queen bed which was particularly comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby. The first night we ate at the hotel's own gourmet restaurant (The Lockwood) which did not disappoint. The breakfasts are also served in this restaurant. We had the buffet both mornings and these were good value for the quality offered. Generally we found the service in this hotel good and the staff very helpful. A nice touch was that when we checked out of the hotel to go to our next destination the car we had booked to pick us up was a few minutes late arriving. A member of staff supervising the doormen saw us looking a bit lost and came over to assist us find the car when it did arrive. Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays for both quality and value for money. 
My wife and I redeemed some of my Hilton Reward Points to stay a few nights at the Palmer House. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. From the moment you walk into the lobby you can tell that this place is nice. As we were Diamond members we got upgraded to a suite which was great because we were provided access to their executive lounge (free food & drinks). The service was excellent and the location of the hotel is within walking distance of many sights on the south side of Chicago. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone interested in coming to Chicago. 
We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in early December, we stay there that weekend every December and we think it is the best location in the city for us. We like State Street better than Michigan Avenue and the Palmer House is right there. We stayed in the Towers, in a room with two double beds and 2 baths. The room was not huge, but very comfortable. The towers area was recently refurbished and it shows, the lobby is beautiful with plasma screen TVs on the walls, comfortable chairs and tables and a seperate room for the food/drinks. There is a continental breakfast in the morning, appetizers during cocktail hour and cookies are laid out until the room closes. There is a fridge stocked with soft drinks, water and juice that are yours for the taking. We were very pleased with the upgraded Towers, everyone should check it out! 
We just got back from a great weekend in Chicago and have no complaints about the Palmer House. It's very easy to get to from O'hare(the Blue line on the EL train) and then just a 2 block walk from the train station. The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and go out of their way to help. We booked an air/hotel package deal on Expedia. We expected to stay in a room with a full size bed but for only $45 extra per night we upgraded to the Excutive level! Best decision of the trip. We had a beautiful room with a King bed,down comforter,robes,plush towels etc...it also included a nice Continental breakfast each morning,all day snacks and beverages and a great happy hour! We took advantage of this every day. The location was great..lots of shopping along State St. and to get to the Magnificent Mile was a $5 cab ride or a 20 minute walk! We'll be back to Chicago and the Palmer House! 
Guys trip to Chicago, scored this hotel on Priceline for $100 a night. Had a little confusion over the bed situation at first. They said they only had kings available even after I had called and requested 2 doubles. After a 30 minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with 2 doubles. The room was nice, nothing specacular, a little on the small side but nice. The lobby was beautiful to look at but that's about it. Hotel is within walking distance to Soldier Field, Sears Tower, ESPN Zone, and lots of bars and restaurants. Great location that and the price we got the room for made our trip. Would definately try and stay at this hotel again. 
We just returned from a weekend at the Palmer House. We normally stay north on the Mag Mile but wanted to be closer to Soldier's Stadium and the Art Insitiute this time. We were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival at half the price that we paid for a regular room at the Four Seasons two weeks earlier. What a suite!! It was huge. The basic living room, dining room and kitchen/wet bar area was one large room. Up to three additional bedrooms can be added by the use of connecting doors. All rooms were spotlessly clean. They even smelled good. Lovely soaps, robes, etc. Lots of large closets. The bathrooms were older but well maintained. Much better than the ones at the Four Seasons. The furniture was nice but worn in some spots. The beds and linens were excellent. Room service was fast. The food and service were great. The pool and workout areas were clean and well maintained. We had one small problem with a burned out lightbulb in one of the lamps. Maintaince arrived quickly with a new bulb. They wouldn't allow me to tip them!! Check-in was somewhat slow as the hotel has been sold out for several weeks. This is a very large hotel, so they have to move a lot of people and rooms. Also, the hotel does not have views as it is configured like an "E". All in all, the Palmer House is a good value for the money. 
My wife and I decided to spend three days in Chicago last summer, and booked via Expedia. When we first walked into the lobby we almost fell over at its' beauty. It's like something out of Europe. We were able to get a free room upgrade, even though the rooms are still a bit small, but its' an old hotel in an old city. It's there for sleeping and showering. The restaurants, lounges, and shops were all wonderfull. The next time we travel to Chicago, I'll be affraid to stay anywhere other than the Palmer House Hilton 
I booked this hotel for $75 on Hotwire with mid-level expectations for one night. Totally blown away. Arrived on a Sunday night. Gave car to valet ($51/night). Lobby was a social people watching scene with swank music. Check-in was smooth and easy. I asked for an upgrade and was told no free upgrades to 3rd party bookings. Upgrade to suite was available at a cost. I passed since only 1 night stay. I asked for a nice, quiet room away from noisy housekeeping and ice machine. Received room 10-120. Room was huge with 2 beds. Felt like 400 square feet. Newly renovated last year. Bell hop told me some rooms are very small so I totally lucked out! Service from start to finish was top notch. Everyone had a smile on their face. Always spoke with great respect and made us feel welcome. Ordered room service at 10:45 PM. Arrived in 1/2 hour. food was so-so. Had pancakes in Lockwood for breakfast. Very good food and very good service. Strong coffee. Hotel is right on State Street shopping. FYI - Rooms on floors 15 and below were renovated last year. Rest were done 5 years ago. For the price, it was a great bargain! Only complaint is bathroom is small. 
We booked this hotel using points on our credit card. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a friendly face. We arrived several hours before check-in. However, they let us check-in early. They also gave us a free room upgrade. The hotel is absolutely stunning! In addition, it is off of State Street. There are many things to do - shopping, dinning, theater. It is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the United Center or the airport. The hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge. The room was so dark and quiet we slept in. 
I stayed at the Palmer House for @ $150/night on a corporate rate. The bed was excellent, the linens/towels were top of the line. I did not find my room shabby, as other reviewers noted. The Palmer House is over 130 years old. Rooms have older woodwork and classic furniture; I think that lends to the ambience of the place. It is expensive, and I'm not sure I'd stay there if my company weren't picking up the tab. But the hotel itself is still awe-inspiring. 
Attended a conference at the Palmer House and it truly surpassed my expectations. I had no idea it would be so large, so nice and with so many amenities. I also didn't realize that it is just around the corner from Milenium Park and the Art Institute. We were met at the door by the friendliest staff. Even with a long line at check-in, the entire process was about 10 minutes. We enjoyed the room with the up-to-date TV, decent size bathroom and comfortable bed. Had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant. Paid $200/night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown Chicago. We have stayed at the Sofital which is much more upscale, but we also paid over $300/night there. 
beautiful place with European charm. No complaints, great location, (never like parking in Chicago, though). It was $35 a night next door. Large beautiful lobby, a touch of class. Fantastic location for downtown, Navy Pier, and the great Grant Park(Millenium Park, too)...Loved it. 
Spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend. The staff was wonderful, room was beautiful and location great. You can take the train directly from Midway and walk one block to the hotel. Very close to museums and restaurants. I have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to Chicago. 
It has been a couple of years since I stayed here, and got it for a night last weekend on Hotwire. I paid only $100 and stayed a Saturday night. I was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel. The lobby has always been great, but the rooms were a little shabby in the past. Not any more, as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years. The location is still amazing, and with the Berghoff open again, there is a great restaurant within walking distance. 
Stayed here October 31 through November 5 for a cconference. This is beautiful hotel and the location is perfect. The Art Institute and Millenium Park is a short 2 block walk from the hotel. My room was small, but beautiful. The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows. Alas, no coffee maker in the room...The staff was helpful and friendly. I'd stay here again! 
We just returned from a girls shopping /sight-seeing trip.The Palmer House was like home away from home.The hotel is undergoing renovations but we did not notice any inconveniences or hear any noise from the work.The lobby was breathtaking, all dressed up for Christmas.The staff from check-in to housekeeping was very welcoming and friendly.Our room was updated with two beds and two separate baths which was great for everyone to have their own personal space.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.Chicago is a great town. 
I stayed here for about a week during a conference and the service was excellent. In addition to the excellent service the location was great. With quick access to Michigan Ave.. The bars and Shula's restaurant were excellent. You must have the rib-eye steak...very well done. 
When we were stranded in Chicago for two days since our flight home was canceled, our airline put us in touch with hotels.com who found us the room at the Sheraton Towers. After a long and frustrating day that ended up with us still in Chicago, arriving at the Sheraton was a joy. The entire staff was wonderful. The bell staff was great helping us (finally) let go of the heavy bags, Jonathan at check in was very helpful and had us in a room which he upgraded for us in no time. We enjoyed the location and the facilities of this property during our unexpected stay and would highly recommend this location to others. We can't say enough about the staff. If we are in Chicago in the future we will definitely return here! 
We stayed at the Sheraton by Navy Pier the first weekend of November and were very pleased with the accommodations and the service. We were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining. The view from both rooms was spectacular (as you can tell from the picture attached). They also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special. The hotel is central to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. so we walked, trolleyed, and cabbed all around the area. We ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good. The eggs were a little runny, but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station. Our six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $14 (instead of the adult $20) The rooms were clean, the concierge & reception staff were both friendly and helpful...we will definitely visit this Sheraton again when we're in Chicago next time. 
Having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website, I arrived tired from Ireland, to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night, but did have rooms for the rest of the week. They booked me in to another (not as nice) downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation. On my return to the hotel next day, I was upgraded to the Club level. What really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake...unprompted. Of course, the hotel itself (particularly on the 32nd floor) is excellent. I will definitely be back. 
We recently celebrated our 20th anniversary in Chicago and stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. Having looked at a gizillion places I chose this one because of its location to Navy Pier. (We were going on a dinner cruise-The Odyssey at Navy Pier) The hotel is a short walk...unless you are wearing heels:) to Navy Pier. We found out on the way home only a $5 cab ride:) worth $20 to your blisters!! Its also only a short walk to Michigan Ave shopping...for comfortable shoes perhaps?? I chose this hotel because of location, but the views are also terrific. This time we had a lake view of Navy Pier, but our previous trip we had a river and lake view. both very nice. The hotel is very nice. Several restaurants, although we haven't tried them. The burger place downstairs sure smelled good though:) We ended up at Bubba Gumps at Navy Pier. GOOD! The rooms were very spacious and CLEAN!! I am kind of a germaphobe! so clean is important for my sanity:) The bottom level has doors that leads right out to the riverwalk, and a cool water fountain. :) I obviously highly recommend this hotel:) I <3 CHICAGO 
The sheraton was a wonderful hotel! When me and my mom flew in we were really tired so we decided to take a quick nap. We didnt want to get up! The beds are absolutely to die for. I wanted to take it home with me. The service was great and this was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest hotel ive ever stayed in. They had a really nice restaurant inside with excellent food. 
We always stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers when we take our kids to the city. You can't beat the location which is in walking distance of Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous Fox & Obel, a high end grocery store with many prepared items available to go and a great cafe that serves a stellar breakfast. The hotel staff are professional and courteous and the rooms are more than adequate with very comfy beds. My kids enjoy the pool with it's windows that overlook the Chicago river. 
My husband, teenage son and myself stayed at this hotel last August. We were transferred there by tour operator who had sent us to a terrible hotel on the other side of Chicago. When I complained I asked for us to be transferred to the Sheraton which they arranged for us. I have stayed at many hotels in my life and this has been the best. The room (although I know it was not the largest) was beautiful and very clean with every amenity you needed. It also had superb views of the river and the lake. The entrance hall to the Sheraton is so imressive as is the leisure centre. In fact all areas are fantastic. The best thing about the hotel though was the staff! From the bellboy, to the receptionists, the dining staff to the concierge - each one was courteous and so very helpful. One of the conciergies spent fifteen minutes on the phone trying to locate a specific pair of trainers for my son! Above and beyond the call I would say! I cannot reccomend this hotel highly enough. The breakfast buffet cost about 10 dollars each but you could eat as much as you like and take as long as you like which we did!! It lasted us all day. If you have the choice of where to stay I think you will enjoy the Sheraton! We did!! 
We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August. We waited a while to check in even though there were quite a few desks open, this was a little annoying as the receptionists seemed to work in two's. Our room had a great view of Navy Pier and was a good size. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. The location of the hotel is the best, we walked to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The breakfast buffet was great although a little pricey and the bar very relaxing for a nightcap or two. Would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again. 
I have been 4 times in Chicago, and I have stayed in 4 different Hotels: This has been for much the very best option. The lobby, the warm of the receptionist, the room, the hotel is very good. It is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and there's no chance for you to get lost from this hotel. If you like to travel with style this could be a very good option. 
I stayed for just one nite at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other TA posters but I was not let down. I got the room via PL @ $70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot. Since I had nothing to lose, I asked to be moved to a "room with a view". The front desk attendant( Rasheeda) wanted to make sure that the room I had at first was clean and was in order and I assured her that it was. She then moved me up to the 24th floor with ease and it took about 1 minute. I was quite surprised as I have heard that they treat PL and Hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers. The new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the Navy Pier, a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of Lake Michigan. All this for $70? Yep! I skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious! The room was comfy, had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location. I didnt use it since I wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk. The bed and pillows were very comfy, but I awoke at about 330 in the morning sweating from the comfy but VERY WARM and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed. This was a great deal for the price and I would absolutely stay here again. 
I booked this via Priceline, and was not sure I'd like it, as some Sheratons have fallen off the cliff. This hotel absolutely surpassed my expectations. Despite booking with Priceline, I was treated like a king. They let me check in early, gave me a beautiful room, and even went so far as to look up my Starwood number so I could get some credit for the stay. The staff was unfailingly pleasant, the property immaculate, and the room very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel. 
Great location - right on the Chicago River - away from the other skyscraper hotels - our room was good size, very clean and with a nice river view - Overall, a great staff - in particular I would like to point out Christy Morgan - Chief Experience Officer and Paula Fortney - Concierge for their assistance in making this stay a memorable one - (in the interests of full disclosure, we stayed here on our AMEX - Starwood points) 
This is a great hotel! The views are fabulous, the service it friendly and the location is superb. We booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the Chicago River. The only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped. We booked our room for $89 a night for Memorial Day weekend. It was a steal! I highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be returning! 
i stayed at this hotel for a week with my family this hotel is huge so clean has comfy beds foods great staff couldn,t of being any nicer. stayed here for thanksgiving it was fabulous second time in chicago and still want to go back again ... the hotel is within walkin distance to both state street and michicgan avenue.There,s taxis right outside the hotel and the concierge can also ring for mini buses if your travelling with a big crowd.there,s also a cinema 2 mins away opposite the hotel . Perfect Hotel for a great get away ... 
My daughter and I were in Chicago for one night after having attended a three-day conference elsewhere in Illinois. We were only in Chicago on our way home. We didn't know where to stay in Chicago, but booked one night at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based on their ad in the Chicago Visitors Guide. We're glad we did! We enjoyed our stay very much. Our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city. That's what we wanted--a great view, and we got it. Also, the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop (we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it wasn't bad--saved us a lot of money). The elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available. We found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating. The only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in Chicago. We wish we could have stayed there at the Sheraton for at least another night. We would definitely stay there again. 
My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers in February. Everything about the hotel and experience was superb. The location was wonderful as well. Our room overlooked the river and we had a great view of the lake towards Navy Pier. The best part of the stay was the "sweet sleeper" bed. It was so comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful as well. Nothing bad to say about this Sheraton! I will stay here again! 
This was a great place to be! Great views of river and lake, walk to everything, a clean and comfortable room, and very accommodating staff. We arrived early and were checked in by 10:30 am and checked out late , effectively adding two days to our vacation. It is a large hotel but the staff works hard and takes good care of the customers. 
This is one of my favorite Sheratons/Starwood properties. I have stayed at a lot of hotels (mostly Starwood) in Chi but all around, this is my favorite based on cost, amenities and downtown location. I really like it beginning with unloading the taxi because I am greeted by Nick who has been there for years. He gives the best greeting from LA to NY and is always happy! He obviously loves his job. People at the front desk are always nice and efficient. If you like to workout, Roberta runs their fitness center. Another one who loves their job and serves guests well. Great lake / river view while working out. On this particular trip I was caught in a pinch; however, Christy the former mgr was able to take care of a frequent guest. I considered it a "minor miracle" based on hotel availability. The maids on 29th floor were very friendly and efficient. Another great experience. 
The Sheraton is a fantastic hotel. My wife and I stayed on the 29th floor overlooking the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. The view was great. We got a corner room that also had a couch in. The hotel was just a short walk to the Navy Pier and the Magnificant Mile Shopping area. Food at the hotel was great. Service from checking in to maid service was first class. Great Hotel, Great Town, Highly recommend it. 
On a recent trip to Chicago to attend a major trade show I had the pleasure of staying with the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. I say stay with as that is how they make you feel, from check in to check out they go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect and you want to return. The rooms are clean, chic and roomy, the beds - the best I have slept in, bathrooms large and super clean. What can I say, my new home when in Chicago... 
Mostly great with a few islands of relatively minor problems. First the good: Outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland, as befitted the season. The restaurant service was absolutely flawless ( servers who don't write orders because they are expected to remember them, remember clients clearly from one day to the other, and go above and beyond consistently). Rooms are comfortable: yes the beds are great! The gym is well equipped. Second the slightly off putting: mmmhh...we got the "I love chocolate package" which advertized: bfast every day, dinner once, snack once and...a gift. And we have an A-Club favorite guest membership, which also advertized " a gift". So, no gift...either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership. Upon enquiry, "the snack was the gift". Not at all what the package suggested. That said, bfast was sublime and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well. Some problems at checkout though: we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but seemingly less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem. Would absolutely go back, but probably not on a special package. 
Stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for 3 nights in early April 2007. Very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the Golden Mile. Good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice French twist. Dinner at the restaurant was also good. Prices are reasonable. Room is comfortable, only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. Excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. Would definitely stay here again if visiting Chicago. Concierge recommended a small van tour, which was excellent. However early April is too early to visit Chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of Chicago was not operating yet. 
I read the reviews on Trip Advisor for this property which had it ranked as #1 in Chicago. I got a king room overlooking Michigan Ave. The view was beautiful. The room was also impeccable. Nice and bright, very fresh and modern. I find it very hard to fault any Sofitel's. The service, attentiveness of staff, cleanliness and luxury are always top notch. Location was great, head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafe's and restaurants. Straight ahead of the hotel on Michigan Ave is a shoppers paradise. A great place to stay, and much better value than Park Hyatt. I do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy, such as for the internet. When you are paying top dollar, a few inclusions would be nice. 
Sometimes you just can't find fault with a hotel, even if you tried. Such was the case with Sofitel, where we'd never stayed before. It's a sleek, modern, sophisticated hotel with European touches. We spent three days there on a leisure weekend, we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the Hancock Building, at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $165 a night. The room was average sized, well-appointed, everything in it worked, and it had a fabulous view of the Chicago high-rise jungle, including snippets of the lake. The public areas were wonderfully decorated. The restaurant served a good breakfast at, for Chicago, reasonable prices. The staff was excellent. My wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches. The staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her. 
Just got back from a 10 day visit to Chicago. For the rate of $219 per night, it was extremely good value. Reception staff were efficient, courteous and very friendly. I was given a room on the top floor (32nd floor) facing the lake and the John Hancock Tower. The rooms were large and very comfortable. Housekeeping/Turn Down Service were efficient and thorough. Bathroom amenities were very good and replaced daily. This is definitely my first choice for a Hotel in Chicago. It is also very close to all the shops, restaurants and the subway. 
this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago, and I've been to this hotel at least 4 times. the rooms are clean, wonderfully designed and comfortable. The staff is friendly, service focused - and the restuarant is great, especially for the breakfast fruit crepes. Love this hotel. It's a great location, very good and consistent service and quality . 
This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Chicago. I've also tried Amalfi and a number of larger chain hotels downtown. This one was the best. Great service, beautiful room, roomy bathroom, top-notch amenities. 
Stayed here as a treat to myself while in Chicago recently for a concert. I totally LOVED IT here!! When you called either the Front Desk or Room Service, the phone was answered with "Hallo Mrs (Name)" which was a great personal touch. Vanessa at the front desk, went out her way to help me - storing some things in a safe for me before I could book into my room. My room was wonderful - the bathroom was luxurious. I was on the 30th floor and the views were superb. We ordered room service and it came quickly and the guy was so friendly and nice. The doormen were great too and I wore jeans and a tshirt one day and they still opened the door for me, so no snobbery there. Comfortable, cozy bathrobes were available in the bathroom, the lights went on in the wardrobe (never seen that before!!), tv was HD ready and flat screen. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud - best sleep for a while. Would I stay here again?? Oh yeah!! No problem - just need to save up first!! 
our stay was absolutely perfect. its a cool hotel to look at, the design and feel is very trendy and hip. all the staff are terrific, especially the consierge staff-great info and attitude. our room was on the top floor, with great views. super comfy bed, and neat bathroom. fantastic, choose this with no hesitation! 
Striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life. The attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night's sleep I've ever experienced in a hotel. Gorgeous LCD tv and Bose wave machine added to my enjoyment. Sofitel is worth the extra $'s. 
Excellent service! Clean and spacious rooms with a great view of downtown Chicago. Location is excellent for exploring the main sights and the Golden Mile. Great concierge service. Pricey though... Don't valet if you don't need to. 
I just returned from a stay at this fabulous hotel - what a treat! The hotel website offers a great rate, and what I found was affordable luxury. I asked for a high floor & found myself with a fabulous view, in a room where there was an orchid spray in the bathroom, terrycloth robes and slippers, turndown service, Roger Gallet toiletries, a fluffy down conforter, and a wonderful pillowtop bed. The bathroom was so clean that it sparkled. The service was impeccable as well. Even my room service breakfast was way above average with an incredibly generous basket of excellent croissants, brioches, & pain au chocolat. The decor was unique & the location convenient. Check out the stunning flowers throughout the lobby. This is a topnotch hotel. 
I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business. It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable. The rooms are spacious, great beds, pillows and linen. The bathroom has a great shower and bath. WiFi works really well and the desk is large. The staff are wonderful. The location is great for shopping, spa's, Starbucks and hairdressers. I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it. 
I stayed for four nights while attending a conference. The hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to Michigan Ave shopping or Rush St., but just off the busy streets. The room I had was spacious, and very well-appointed. The staff was friendly, and the fitness center, while not huge, was well-equipped and clean. I've stayed at a number of hotels in Chicago, and this one is my favorite. Internet wasn't free, but at $10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels, and it worked very well. 
After some deliberation I booked the Sofitel Water Tower Place for a 3 night stop-over in June. This was my first visit to Chicago and it turned out that we had a really great time. We loved our rooms, which were just the basic type on the lower floors but they were very well appointed. The decor is modern and personally I liked it a lot. The rooms were pleasant and airy and the bed extremely comfortable. The hotel location is just perfect, close to the shops on Michagan Avenue, and the beach at Oak Street. Lovely restaurants close by and nightlife in Rush Street is just steps away. The area although bustling was peaceful and quiet. We could walk to most places and I would not hesitate to stay here again. The hotel staff very helpful, always smiling and ready to help; from the doormen to the helpful lady at Conceriage. I would not hesitate at all to stay at Sofitel Water Tower Place next time I'm in Chicago; in fact I look forward to my next visit. 
We just arrived from a 3 nights stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. It was faboulous. Fine Linen, nice room with bigs windows, bathroom with a shower, flat TV. Check for the deals on the Sofitel website, we had 3 nights for the price of two ! 
We just got back from 3 nights at the Sofitel. We really have nothing bad or negative to say about it. We've stayed at other higher end hotels in Chicago such as the Park Hyatt, The Peninsula, and The Four Seasons - and the Sofitel tops them all. It's a 4 star hotel with 3 star prices. It's a beautiful hotel all the way around. Staff is uniformly friendly without being patronizing. They were helpful with the one small problem we had and solved it quickly. The common areas are fresh and modern in appearance. The room was very clean with comfortable beds and well-appointed marble-accented baths. My wife loved the huge tub. We had breakfast via roomservice every morning and it was always hot and delicious. The robes and Evian at turndown was always appreciated. The property is ideally situated in the middle of the Gold Coast and all the best shopping and eating is within a short walk. Want a Bentley or latte? They're all close by. This was our second stay since it opened and I'm sure it's to be our home away from home when we are in Chicago. 
Beautifully appointed, professionally staffed, comfortable, well-located, and elegant, with wireless internet access (plus free access in an alcove on the second floor), fitness center (a little small but fine if you use it at the right time), good energy clientele, easy access to Michigan Avenue, next door to 24-hour restaurant, 2 blocks from 2 Starbucks, elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button - they thought of everything. Will definitely return! 
Great beds, clean rooms, amazing bathroom, nifty view, wonderful service, expensive parking ($40, but it's Chicago), speedy in and out. Very European in sensibility and amenities, but with air conditioning! 
We booked our room at the Swissotel on Hotwire for $88 (unbelievable rate!) and were extremely impressed with the Swissotel. The staff was so polite and catered to our every need. The room was oversized, clean, and had a large bathroom. We had a partial view of Lake Michigan, which was an added bonus. On the 42nd floor, they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides. Spectacular! We sat in the hot tub and looked down on Navy Pier. We can't wait to go to the Swissotel again! 
We stayed at the swissotel for our 25th anniversary. We got a corner room with both a lake and city view. The room was very clean and spacious. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We asked for late checkout, and was told no problem. If you bring your car, park in millinum parking it is just 2 blocks away. The cost there is $14.00 compared to the swissotel which is $41.00. 
Stayed here for one night in June, but have stayed here before when on business in Chicago. Great location for business/shopping/sightseeing. In between Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile and the Loop and next to the Chicago River. Rooms very spacious and clean. Gym has a wonderful view, as it is situated on the top of the hotel. Bar next to lobby, very busy with good atmosphere. Cannot fault the hotel. Prefer it to the Westin - my previous address when in Chicago. 
The Swisshotel is awesome. Very high class. It is expensive , but so is every hotel in Chicago. It is off from the dingy areas of our city , yet a long walk to Navy Pier, so you will need to pay for the cab. Note to all the Magnificent Mile is boring as can be. I live in Chicago and the hotel is a better experience than the Mile of Navy (BORING) Pier. 
Swissotel was the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in! The room and bathroom were quite large for downtown Chicago. The pool and hot tub were also very nice. I would definately recommend this hotel. We didn't hear any noise in our room from other guests or from the city. It is in a great location - walking distance to Millenium Park, the Loop and Michigan Ave. 
a great hotel, we used the CTA the 2 days we were in Chicago and it is great, that the Line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel. So we did not need any taxi and traveled from Midway to the city and to Ohare for 9$ and we used the buses alot (freezing cold). The hotel itself is great, very clean rooms, realy on of the best bathrooms i ever had. Staff very friendly, they even found me out were i can get Timerland shoes.... and she was right i got them in one place she told me... thats service...I also was having a look to the gym room and the swimming pool area, did not use it and I do not know if it would have been included in the room price....but realy a nice view makes running easyer.... 
If you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and you're willing to pay a little extra, I'd recommend this place.Also, pay the extra for a corner room - the views of the city are spectacular.A short walk to Michigan Avenue. Excellent service from the valets, concierge, lobby agents, and waitstaff in the restaurants. The food in the restaurants was great and room service wasn't too shabby either.Well worth the money! 
I stayed at the Swissotel for a business trip the first week of Aug 2007. I arrived late the first night and got shoved into a hospitality room the first night. However, this was more than made up when after a strong talk they assigned me a corner room on the 28th floor. EXCELLENT view of the city, river and Lake Michigan. In fact, I would say the corner room of the Swissotel has a better view than any other hotel in the vicinity. The room was huge, and everything was clean and the bathroom was nice. The hotel is very convieniently located to the Magnificient Mile and Millenium Park. Would very much recommend this hotel, and would suggest trying every method possible to get a corner room in a higher floor. 
I thought the Swissotel was a great hotel. The rooms were very spacious and clean, especially for downtown Chicago standards. Most importantly, the rooms were quiet. I never heard people in the hallways when I was trying to sleep. The only downside was that the beds were not anything special. Sure, like all hotels in Chicago, this hotel caters to wealthy and/or business clients with ridiculous minibar and parking price. However, if you are aware of that prior to arrival, its not a big deal (ie finding a different place to park the car, bringing our own snacks for the room). It would be nice though if hotels such as the Swissotel had a microfridge in the room for guest use. Staff was very helpful. Bellmen instantly got cabs upon request, and the front desk was efficient and helpful. Overall, if I can get a good rate again, I'll stay at the Swissotel the next time I am in Chicago. 
My boyfriend and I were amazed by the breathtaking view of Lake Michigan! We are from Texas so the view of the city was very important to us. We had no problems at this hotel... rooms, service, location were top notch. 
This is a wonderful hotel with all the amenities. Everyone was helpful. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. The bed was "just like home". We would definitely stay again. A nice touch was the water bottles left in our car for us to enjoy on our way home. It was little touches like this that make this hotel one of the best. 
This was our third trip to Chicago this year (we LOVE the city!) - every time we stay at a different downtown hotel. Swissotel was definitely our favourite. When we come back in July to see the play " Wicked" for the second time, we will be again at Swissotel. No more need to try other hotels! The location is good because it is between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile. The room was spotless and quiet, the view amazing and those elevators were so fast. Comfortable beds, friendly service, not as many noisy sirens! We even watched the Navy Pier fireworks from our bed! This was the best anniversary ever. We would recommend Swissotel to everyone! 
Stayed here on business a few nights and really liked it. Very attractive, classy and comfortable hotel that's got an element of sexy and sharp. Public spaces are very nice, with an open area bar in the front lobby and nice sitting areas. Rooms are lovely as well, with handsome fixtures and furniture, a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed. Bathroom amenities and fixtures are sleek and attractive as well. Best of all, the hotel has breathtaking views of the city and the water - both the river and the lake. If you're working in the area, it's the best choice for that part of town, and I prefer it to the nearby Hyatt and Monaco. 
We have been for the first time in Chicago and stayed in the Swissotel for five nights,a wonderful place.Room was on the 29th floor,absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview.Breakfast perfect and service really good.People were always helpful.It's a little bit far from Magnificent mile and the loop,but in front of the hotel there are buses (number6)waiting there next turn,not a real bus stop,but drivers are frindly and you can get on the bus.Next time going to Chicago we will again stay in the Swissotel. 
I just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago. A friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate. Cheaper than even a fleabag motel. So keep an eye out for specials. The view was great, the location was prime. The staff was helpful. The room was large (we had 2 double beds). I only have one complaint. Our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees (I think) would sneak off to talk on the phone. The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day. Fortunately, the sound was only in the bathroom so it wasn't like it kept us up at night. It was just a little weird. Overall, a great stay and I will definitely stay there again. 
My 3 nieces and I stayed here for a long weekend, we had a wonderful time. We arrived early around 8:30am and they let us into our room. This was very nice otherwise we would have had to store our luggage and register later Room was very clean as was the bathroom. With 4 women we needed extra towels, they brought them up right away and then we got a call to make sure they were delivered. Room was also quiet, construction going on behind us and we never heard anything. Beds comfy and so were the quilts... Good location for Michigan Ave. All in all a wonderful stay. Would return. 
The best service!!! The staff here was incredible. You never had to lift a finger. The room was huge as hotel rooms go. The view was phenomenal. Location great. What a great weekend. We did stop for a drink at the Palm Restaurant and unfortunately, it closes at 11 p.m. Too bad!!! The Lobby Lounge is open later but drinks costs twice as much as the bar at the Palm. 
I loved it here! My boyfriend and I booked this hotel online and were a little worried what it would be like since we paid next to nothing for our 3 nights here. (I've paid more to stay at the Santa Barbara Motel 6!!) Gorgeous hotel, great staff, fun bar/lounge area and we were most impressed with the room. The large windows in the bathroom were the best--I took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of Navy Pier and the skyline. I remember thinking, "This is really living..." The room was comfortable and quiet, again with great views just like in the bathroom. Chicago is a wonderful town--I have nothing but good things to say about it. CAn't wait to come back! 
We stayed at the Swissotel for a special birthday weekend for my wife from Aug 25 to 29. I had called ahead to ask for a nice room and to order flowers for my wife. Jaymes Ballard, the Concierge, made arrange for flowers, early check-in and we had a great room. Our room was the 33rd floor with a view facing the city. Room was large, everything looked like new, great bed, large bathroom with separate shower, great ammenities. A beautiful bouquet of flowers arrived upon our arrival. The hotel is about 10 mins from everything, not close but not far from anything. Has a great restaurant, 2 patios outside where I had a cigar. A really nice pool and hot tub on the 42nd floor. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and thanks to Jaymes for making our trip very special. 
I recently stayed at this hotel with my family (10-1 / 10-3). We had a terrific experience. I landed the hotel through Priceline for $80 per night and paid an additional $75 per night for a suite on the 41st floor. My two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the 42nd floor was easily accessible. I found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating. I would love to stay here again. 
Very quaint and romantic, yet masculine. I've noticed that at most Chicago hotel bars it's hard to get a drink much less a seat but I guess because it's a small hotel that was not a problem at the Talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that! Would love to stay again but I must say that I was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm. Also note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout! 
My girlfriends and I stayed 4 nights at the Talbott returning home on Saturday 9/29. We all had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. The staff from top to bottom were excellent, accommodating. The room was roomy...with our only complaint being not being able to cool the room fast enough after a day on the town. The construction next door was obstructing the sidewalk, but being on a oneway street limited that difficulty. The doorman, Andrew was an excellent source at this hotel. He arranged all our transportation at night to restaurants. We enjoyed everything about the hotel and the city. The hotel was expensive but met expectations. 
My wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Talbott. The room was spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. The hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby. Linens and towels first-class. Free Wi-Fi in the room. The location is terrific, just one block to Michigan Avenue. We will stay here on future visits. 
As we pulled away in a taxi heading to the airport for our trip home my wife turned to me and said "We picked the right place." Having chosen the Talbott from other Trip Advisor reviews I found myself thinking in terms of a Trip Advisor review when we arrived. Nice entrance, friendly reception, I noticed everything and immediately knew the Talbott was a non-corporate warm hotel with touches not typically seen in big name hotel chains. The smell of the elevator and attention to decorative details strongly reminded me of Europe, simple, not overstated but elegant. The location is great, there was light snow but we walked to the Art Institute, Rush Street, the Theater District, and we're from California where anything below 50 degrees keeps us inside! All I can say is if you are the kind of traveler that wants comfort, class and somewhere unique, stay at the Talbott. Oh yeah, we were in a room that looked down at the construction, we were on the 15th floor and could not hear a sound, it was very quiet. 
I have just returned from a lovely shopping trip to Chicago. It is a very nice hotel, and I will love to stay there if I visit Chicago again! There is a lot of positive to say about the hotel; staff is excellent, never experienced such an excellent service -- that alone is worth coming back for. Was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast. A few things that could make this hotel even better... A hand shower in the bathroom. The hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom, instead of the bathroom, when the bathroom is all damp after a shower I prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair. Free internet access in the lobby. I was surprised I had to pay 6 or 7 USD (for 15 minutes) to log-on and check-in with my airline (only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying?!?!?!?) 
We loved our stay at the Talbott. We were in Chicago to attend the theater show Dirty Dancing. We booked our room through Orbitz and received a nice discount. When we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy. We were upgraded to a King bed suite. The suite was well decorated and spacious. My wife particularily enjoyed the heat that could be directed at the marble floor in the bathroom. We loved the hotel and will definitely stay at the Talbott on our next trip to Chicago. Highly recommended. 
My wife and I stayed two nights at the Talbott at the end of February. This little hotel was the perfect place for us. The lobby is very small but also cozy, and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The room was pretty spacious, and the king bed was extremely comfortable. We had a seventh floor room facing delaware st, so there was really no view. The bathroom was a good size, including two sinks and a spacious tub/shower. There was also free wireless internet...a big plus for us. Perhaps the best thing about the Talbott is the location. We were only a few steps from State, Rush, and North Michigan. Tons of shopping, bars, and good food are easily within walking distance. This makes the Talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in. We highly recommend the Talbott, and will gladly stay again on return trips. 
Location, location, location. What a great find! Excellent, well-run, small boutique-type hotel on a tree-lined street near all the action without being in the oppressive crunch of it. Rooms are good-sized and clean; good bed and shower with tub. The air conditioner, as mentioned in other reviews, is noisy, but it's a minor complaint. The staff is simply wonderful and attentive from housecleaning to concierge. The on site restaurant is great. The red-line El is about 3-4 blocks away which makes getting around the city a breeze. You are footsteps away from Rush Street and North Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan. I would not have a moment's hesitation booking at this hotel again in the future; in fact, I wouldn't book anywhere else. 
We stayed here because of all the great reviews, and it's all true. We were highly impressed with the high quality of everything, everyone, and the location. Walking distance to much of what Chicago has to offer. Gibson's steakhouse and the Hancock building to name a couple. This hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago. It should also have more than three stars. I mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard, and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those. Depending on the room you get, any price under $250 would be a good deal. Between 250 - 300 could still be worth it. 
I stayed at the Talbott twice in the last few weeks. I was very pleased with every facet of my stays. The staff, from doormen to front desk, to concierge, to housekeeping, were wonderful. The rooms were nicely sized and clean, and well stocked. I will return to the Talbott anytime! 
My husband and I stayed here for three nights while visiting Chicago as tourists. What a beautiful hotel! Our room was lovely, the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient. They don't have an in house gym, but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street. The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast. The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there. We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel, as well as through the Gold Coast and Old Towne neighborhoods. There are tons of great restaurants in the area (including the famous Gibsons and the Signature Room in the Hancock tower) as well as lots of shopping. There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott (they are building condos right behind it), but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago. 
We booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night. We walked over to the Talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay. The room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom. The tub is large and the shower a pleasure. The location was quiet as requested. The staff was always cheerful and very helpful. Tim and Stephanie provide excellent concierge services! The breakfast at the Basil Cafe is a great way to start the day. We travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel. I would highly recommend the Talbott for your stay. 
Stayed 5 nights at this great hotel. Updated rooms. Clean. Used Tim to book theater and dinning reservations. Provided excellent service. Close to subway, shopping and dinning. Excellent value. Free wireless internet and access to nearby health club very nice perks. Highly recommend it. Future concern is adjacent construction of condos. Not a problem while we were there but something to ask front desk about in the future. 
Stayed at the Talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay. Room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift, but everything else made up for that. Positives: Bed was very comfortable, great to have real shower, free internet, gym usage, staff (all friendly) and location. Negative: Lift noise, lifts slow and restaurant (there are so many great restaurants around - don't bother staying in) Would stay again! 
Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Talbott. This was our first visit there, and I can honestly say that I wouldn't stay at any other hotel in Chicago. From when we first were greated by the bell captain until our final departure, the staff was nothing less than amazing, always greeting with a smile and can I help you attitute. The room we had (1508) was very spacious and comfortable. The bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and I have ever slept in (including the Four Seasons). Had great breakfasts and drinks at Basil's. You would be missing a fantastic experience, if you didn't stay at the Talbott. 
I stayed at The Talbott for 3 nights on business and was very pleased. The staff was friendly as can be immediately confirming the lore of the midwest. I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. The free wi-fi came in handy as I needed to work remotely while there. Everything from the comfort of the bed to the staff and location made this a great stay. Oh, and I got to workout at the huge Equinox right next door for free. 
We loved the Talbott. The location was fabulous...very close to the shopping. The hotel is smaller, but the rooms are very nice. They are very spacious and are able to be darkened to sleep well. Also, the beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. I might also add that our room at queen beds. The staff is all friendly and puts them themselves out for you. The hotel has a cute outdoor eating area on the sidewalk that has flowers, etc. It looks like a scene out of Europe. I would highly recommend the hotel. We were there with our daughters; ages 10 and 13. 
My husband attended a conference in Chicago for the weekend of June 22nd and I decided to tag along for the shopping! We flew into O'Hare and took a cab to the hotel, cost about $30. Everybody from the doorman to reception desk to concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a room on the 9th floor which overlooked the construction, but we were hardly in the room so it didn't bother us. We were also never awakened due to construction noise and my husband is a very light sleeper. The room was clean and spacious enough for us. The bed is very comfy. We ate in the restaurant downstairs several times for breakfast and lunch and all meals were great. The location of this hotel is perfect. You are about 1&1/2 blocks from Michigan Ave and the Hancock tower. Can't beat that! There is also an adorable pet store called Tails In The City across from the hotel! I brought our dog back a couple of toys! They are very nice as well. All in all, no complaints. The hotel is clean and beyond what we were expecting. The staff is always friendly and the location is superb. It's a safe neighborhood-I walked around by myself and felt fine. We would definitely return. 
This is a great find for downtown Chicago. The price is right and the staff are excellent. As noted, there is construction going on around the hotel, but I didn't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping. I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor, and was gladly given one. The lobby is small, the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel. The concierge, Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations (along with a complimentary appetizer). We had a standard room, and it was spacious, tastefully decorated--everything we needed. The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking--and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk. Just can't say enough about how nice the staff are--every single person you meet. Would definitely stay here again. 
Chicago is one of our favorite cities to visit. Some friends suggested trying The Talbott. I'm delighted we took them up. The Talbott is a great "small" hotel a block and a half off of Michigan Avenue near the Four Seasons, Drake and Westin. The concierge staff was most helpfull. Gene and Stephanie took great care of us. The rooms were spacious and very fresh. The elevators could be a bit slow at times. Aside from the construction next door, our stay was perfect. Bice now runs the hotel restaurant. We enjoyed having breakfast there. We will stay there again.
