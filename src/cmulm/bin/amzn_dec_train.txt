Perfect price, perfect bass what else can one ask for? With a not so expensive price tag, they are perfect for listening to music, chatting online and gaming. Sound quality is good and they are pretty durable, making it travel friendly. The cable is a little short though, but that's not such a big deal.
Great feeling..Love the flavor. Cinnamon is my favorite. Lasts long..very long
The guitar is awesome. Money well paid. I especially like the bright blue and yellow colours. It really goes well with tabala. Tabala is indian percussion instrument
This is one of the best products I ever bought. It's high definition neodymium driver produces 8Hz to 80kHz response which is totally awesome. And the best part is it can be folded for great portability! Totally an awesome buy.
I have tried several mouse traps, but none of them work as good as this one. It does not require any setup, does not require any kind of maintenance like cleaning and it fits very well in confined spaces! If you are an animal lover and don't want to kill the mouse, then this is the product for you.
Just bought this on Amazon. Amazing product. The high definition quality of the video was simply mind blowing! And I got the entire season 1 collection for this great price!
This is probably the best watch Timex has ever come up with! It features Indiglo Night light which is totally awesome. The polished and the genuine leather gives it a professional look. Totally recommend this watch.
This is the cutest tea set I ever came across. I presented this to my daughter on her first birthday and she was so delighted to see it. She plays with it all day long. It is very safe for children since it is made of wood. If you have a daughter and are looking for a present, this is the one for you.
This is one of the best value for money product I ever bought on Amazon. It's a great device to watch over 200000 TV episodes and movies. It works amazingly with Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu Plus and many more. The voice search is totally out of this world. I can just say what I want to watch and it plays it instantly. What's more, I can play all my amazing games on this. And if you are an Amazon Prime customer, you get unlimited movies to watch. Truly an amazing buy!
VALUE FOR MONEY !! a very cheap laptop, not so big and very light, very easy to carry in my bag, with windows 8 installed for free ... it works very well for my daily job. I often work mobile and not easy to find power source whenever I need, and this laptop can live more than 4 hours without need to be charged often. Amazing !!! The design is great as well. Haven't find this kind of product with very cheap price ...definitely, a must have laptop ... you wont regret it
This is the best book i have ever read. It was a very refreshing read and i would totally recommend it to anyone who wants to spice up their marriage!
This album is a holiday classic in my family. His ""Silent Night"" followed by ""Greensleeves"" is probably one of my favorite two-track combos on any album. Especially if you're not a fan of the typical ""Christmas music,"" I would recommend this album
Absolutely BLOWS all other shooting/helmet-slung goggles for especially their night-vision design and use. Whether using traditional NVG's form hand-helds to scopes on rifles, to using your thermals, they are excellent for clear viewing, and the ease at which you can get them off your helmet's brim to your face. And the cover is perfect!. These goggles fit my head really well and I fell very comfortable both around my eyes and around my head. The antifog coating works great and that is the main feature of these goggles to me.  Used these goggles on ops, fantastic for vehicle mounted operations. Good peripheral vision an all round protection. Can cop frag an come out scratch free. Works well with nvg, wouldn't make a habit of it though due to eye relief an fatigue. Invest the money, it's worth the peace of mind. Pros: well made, high quality, fits perfectly with Aust Army CVC helmet. No headaches in relation to I'll fitment 
This headphones is really good! When I listen to music or play games, it can provide sound with high quality. Also the shape is quite fashion. Besides, it's cheap. Only the transportation speed is a little bit slow. I hope it can improve that. Comparing with other products in Sony, it's a heavy one. That makes it a little uncomfortable when wearing for long time. In short, if you want a pair of soft and light headphones, this product may not be a good choice.  All in all, it's a product with high quality-price index but low comfortable index. It's up to you whether it matches your needs or not. At least you can have a try
Sound quality is just great. Treble and Bass are perfect and you will have an eargasm. The cable is long enough which allows free movement. I would recommend this to all having good taste in music . What comes in my mind when I heard about 'Sony' brand is a high quality electronic product. Then when I come closer by reading the features, I am sure that this headphone will not dissapoint me. The most useful features that I feel very useful is this headphone is foldable so I can bring it inside my bag. With only a small price differences compared with other brands and with all the  features it had, then I decided to buy it.
I started watching this 2 days ago and am hooked to it now.Really like the story development. Those who like DC Comics will obviously like it. Go for it.

It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar 512MB Memory Stick Pro, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this 512MB card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
This battery is long-lasting and charge very fast! I bought 2 of it for my Canon camera. Both of it works well!

Well, I needed some new headphones. I tried the UR5 from Koss. The sound quality was alright, but they could BARELY be heard. I found these, thinking Sony, would make headphones with better and louder sound. I was right.The good news is that the sound quality is excellent. Sony headphones always seem to have more punch than other Koss, RCA, Panasonic, and other brands of headphones. The bass and treble are clear, and bass is pretty deep as other $6 headphones I've tried. I would have enjoyed the headphones that came with my player (SLSV570), but they were uncomfortable, and I mean VERY. These are pretty comfortable and lightweight, as the box explains.The bad news is the overall durability of these headphones, which is a big minus. I've been though two of these, yet the third ones haven't broken yet at all (keeping my fingers crossed).The price is very reasonable and very cheap, and I wouldn't have a problem buying another pair, because of their cheapness.Overall, these headphones add a punch to your music, and the volume is loud for those quiet CD players.
This is a basic portable CD player that features CD-R/RW playability, 35-hour playback on 2 AA batteries (even cheap ones!), 40-second anti-skip system (cannot be turned off, unlike previous basic models from Panasonic), and three-phase equalizer (normal, bass boost, train"). Of course, you can program the playlist as well as disable accidental button presses. It can play MP3s that are burned into audio CDs on CD-R/RW discs, but not MP3 files directly. No big deal since it's real easy to burn audio CDs anyway. The lid color is blue, and many people think it looks cute, but not overly so.Solid build quality, excellent sound quality (esp. on good headphones), long battery life, and ease of use make this the best basic CD player out there today. Made in Japan with a great price tag."

Wow. iPod. How did we listen to music before it? This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats. MP3, AAC, etc. The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection. It allows fast and easy navigation. The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read. The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind. Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.I use my iPod all the time. You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.The problem with my iPod. The first one I received skipped songs randomly. I had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me. I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved. However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now. Thank you Apple! You make fabulous products. The product I rate five stars, but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow. However, you should still buy an iPod! The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed. Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem. I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.iPod will change the way you enjoy music!
The SV-S200 is a great DVD player for an incredible price. Makes a great first or second DVD player in your house. The black styling is, well, stylish, and the player is thinner than many more expensive models. Plays DVDs and DVD-Rs and also many Asian video formats... yes, great for watching those cheap kung-fu movie VCDs from Chinatown. :) Get this. It's so affordable, you have nothing to lose.
These slim jewel cases by TDK provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. Could that be because I'm a 90 pound weakling? SMILE Well, I doubt it--I think these are well constructed. They hold together for years at a time and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases provide excellent storage for media and they measure roughly half the width of the older, original jewel cases that seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too.Moreover, these jewel cases are affordable--and that's great in these times. Each case costs roughly 40 cents which is great considering how long these will last for you. Years' worth of storage space! These jewel cases can be storing discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or whatever. They are not ugly, either.Overall, I highly recommend this CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. Use these in good health!SMILE"
Iomega ZIP 250 MB USB External DriveThis unit has a rounded dark blue case and is powered by the USB port. You should select the icon to Unplug or Eject Hardware" to remove this device. The IOMEGA software should be installed on Windows 2000. If the unit does not have an eject button on the drive you must select the EJECT command from the Properties menu. It is good to do this all the time because of the disk caching system. The 250 MB drives can read and write to 100 MB ZIP disks, but slower than with a 250 MB disk. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an IOMEGA disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords (not usable on a 100MB disk). "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details.Computers have a limited number of IDE devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical. Replaceable 250 MB ZIP disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology. The 250 MB ZIP disk is less widely used than the 100 MB disk. ZIP disks reuse deleted space unlike a CD whose space is consumed when you replace files. Falling prices for CD discs solve that problem. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different Windows systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by different software on another system. [You may find support on the Internet for USB Mass Storage Devices for Win98.]To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
The green 11 filter helps mostly for lightening dark green foilage (brush, grass, etc) against a dark background. It will pass more green and attenuate red/orange and blue tending to darken the sky.For forensic documentation, alot of glow phosphors are green - such as a spectrum analyzer or tritium tubes. This filter helps to highlight the green emissions from those phosphors against the background. The camera can be changed to B&W; mode or left in color depending on the intent of the shot.With a bulb exposure tracks left by a green laser pointer are highlighted and show up almost as handwriting (with practice this can make unique shots). When using the green pointers for night sky exposures, the green filter aids in showing the beam pointing to a star especially against the dark sky.
These slim jewel cases by Fuji provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store any type of media that is the same size, such as DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. Could that be because I'm a 90 pound weakling? SMILE I doubt it--I think these are well constructed. They hold together for years at a time and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases measure roughly less than half the width of the older, original jewel cases that now seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too.These jewel cases can be storing discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or wherever. They are not ugly, either. In fact, they come in several different colors including red, yellow and blue. You can use these colors to categorize types of media so you don't have to hunt endlessly for the type of media you're looking for.As I write this the package of 25 jewel cases costs $5.99. That works out to a cost of roughly 24 cents per jewel case; and that is a bit more expensive than other packages of jewel cases for sale out there. This package of twenty-five jewel cases is really suited best for people with smaller media collections. People who have larger collections of media would do better to find jewel case packages with more jewel cases at a lower cost per case.Overall, I highly recommend these CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. I feel badly for reviewers who had some damaged cases in their shipment; but my shipment came completely intact. Use these in good health!"
This unit is GREAT for laptop and also Desktops! With the One Touch OS backup/files makes it easy with the One Touch button and software provided!1 Second for files backed up and 3 seconds for OS! Also has power-off feature after backup is complete.You can also boot from Hard Drive for recovering the whole drive!Supports up to 2TB.
I bought the HL150 with the HS430, because if I liked one, I could take it back. Let me tell you, the HS430 is going back to Target, pronto.SOUND QUALITY - Very good. The bass is pretty deep, and the highs are very clear. I can hear stuff that I couldn't hear from the MDR101LP from Sony. Also, these are LOUD!!! These are even louder than the Panasonic Wrap-Its! I'm serious. These are a true buy if you hate the headphones that came with your quiet player.COMFORTABILITY - Very comfortable. Then yet, I've never seen the overhead style be uncomfortable. Because there the fold up ear-cup style, the are able to exactly match the ear.PORTABILITY - They don't fold up the bend way. They fold up across, which is a bit awkward, but they do fold up, and they are very portable.COST - I'd rather pay $9 for these, than pay for the Sony brand. I just like the Philips brand so much better because they're loud, have great sound, and are comfortable.OVERALL - These are a great deal for people looking for new overhead type headphones. Look no futher, these are a great pick, and can fit into any budget!
Memorex makes a very reliable blank DVD-R that can handle up to 4.7 GB of data. Moreover, these blank DVD-Rs are capable of recording data at speeds up to 16x. The video I record onto these lasts forever. I have used these as discs to record video both with and without audio.The DVD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your record video onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your DVD-Rs that have information stored on them. Don't store these discs, used or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose your recorded video over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the video onto the blank disc using computer software, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than 16x. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your DVD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the DVD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--and you wouldn't want that, now would you? If you need to label the discs, label its' jewel case using a post-it note.Overall, Memorex blank DVD-R discs store video reliably over the years and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at 16x.Use `em in good health!
The ML-L3 is a small plastic remote control for Nikon's SLR cameras. There's just one button on the ML-L3; you'll set the control mode on the camera itself (e.g., immediately shutter release vs. delayed shutter release). Just point to the IR receiver on the camera (usually on the front) and press the button. A small, cheap-feeling pouch is included with the remote control.Reviewer technology analyst" has it right: Nikon should just include this in their SLR and d-SLR kits, esp. the kits that cost over $500. This remote control is made in China so it probably costs them a couple bucks to make (thanks to the unregulated sweatshops in China!), and they would have generated a lot of good will among Nikon owners and potential SLR buyers."
While this model is eminently capable, it is essentially going to be replaced by the nearly identical Visor Neo. Maybe there will be some last-minute price cuts to clear inventory. As for the product itself, the Visors are very capable Palm OS handhelds, highlighted by a full-size screen and an expansion slot (which I have yet to use, but you can add everything from a cell phone to GPS). This model and the Neo have faster processors compared to the Visor Deluxe, but that's not that big a deal because the Palm OS is so efficient. Batteries last a long time, usually at least two weeks.One issue with the Visors are that they are bulky compared to most other Palm devices (although smaller than Pocket PCs), although they still fit in your shirt pocket. The pricy Visor Edge doesn't seem worth the money on the high end.Someone wanting a full-featured Palm without needing expansion options should get the Palm Vx, which sports a lithium rechargeable battery, an extremely small and svelte shape, and fits into your hand in an ergonomically perfect manner. But that would add a good deal to the cost, so it's your call.
These slim jewel cases by Maxell provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and any other type of media, blank or with data on it, of the same shape and thickness! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. I think these are well constructed. They hold together and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases provide excellent storage for media and they measure roughly half the width of the older, original jewel cases that seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too.These jewel cases can store discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or whatever. They are not ugly, either. In fact, they come in five different colors including red, blue and green. You can use these colors to categorize types of media so you don't have to hunt endlessly for the type of media you're looking for.In addition, because these cases are so slim you can carry a few of them in a carry case for a laptop computer. That's very good.My only gripe is that these jewel cases come in packs of thirty. That's not enough for people like me who have large collections. If you have lots of discs you may want to buy a fifty-pack or even a one hundred-pack from either Maxell or another seller on this website.Overall, I still recommend these CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. Use these in good health--they should last forever!"
I do alot of work with XLR and have my xlr&lt;>RCA male cables for dealing with single ended sources. None of the cables however are made with a female RCA on the rca side, so I ordered a set of these to go with the cables - they were half price on the amazon gold box sale so a good overall value.Now combined with my XLR &lt;> RCA(M) cables I also get XLR &lt;> RCA (F) as well, which I've found helpful with pre-cabled devices that have a RCA (M) output only and the cable is attached.It's a good gadget to have in your cable and adapter bag, but the higher price now makes it a lesser value, though the quality is still exceptional and I still recommend you get a good set of rca professional connectors to avoid scratchy audio. These fit the bill just fine.
I don't want to repeat what others have said aplenty about the NX70V. I just want to provide a quick perspective from a casual user.My overall impression is it's a power user's toy, and I'm very pleased with the built-in VGA-resolution camera, which has fast refreshing speed and high image quality. Sony packs in tons of features on this model, which makes the interface a little too cluttered and too busy. Palm OS is meant to be a simple and elegant experience, but the NX70V is rather daunting especially to the first-time user. The number of features and functions is just overwhelming, obscuring the ease-of-use trumpeted by Palm. And once you start using all the multimedia features, kiss good-bye to battery life: you'd better carry the charger with you at all times.Would I want to own this nice PDA with everything but a built-in sink? Yes. But would I pay such a high price? Nope. I'm really happy with my [the brand I own], which has a better screen and a less stressful user interface and costs only half as much.
GE Digital Messaging System 29875This answering machine has flexible options set by its buttons on top of the machine. The User's Guide" has the instructions in English and Spanish. The telephone line cord is non-removable, so this unit must be near the modular wall jack. It can record incoming messages without a connected telephone. You can access this device via a telephone call to record or play messages, turn the system on or off, and record a message or greeting. Its digital recording allows 30 minutes of recording time for incoming or outgoing messages. It is powered by a small power supply. There is no battery backup, but messages are stored even when power is off. The message counter flashes when there is a new message. There is a time-date stamp for each message.The unit and its buttons are described on page eight. You can record your own greeting instead of using the preset greeting. Other buttons allow changing the Language, Time and Day, Rings to answer, message time, and your own security code setting (to prevent anyone else from accessing the system.). The STOP/SET button effects your changes. The preset greeting can be in English or Spanish. Use the GREETING button to record another language. The NEXT or PREVIOUS button are used to change the hour, minutes, and day for the time-stamp. Next the number of rings before the machine answers a call. The `Toll Saver' option will answer after the second ring if you have a new message. You can also set the length of any incoming message. The Security Code is set last; the three-digit code to allow remote access to this unit.The Message Counter is explained on pages 14 and 15. The single digit displays the number of messages. If this number flashes, it is the number of new messages. Else it shows the number of old messages. If more than ten messages, the counter will display the first digit, the last digit, then a dash. Page 15 lists the other displays. The "User's Guide" explains Playing Messages (p.16), Erasing All Messages (but not new messages), Leaving a Memo (p.17), Screening Calls, and Remote Access (p.18). The care of this product is noted on page 19. Troubleshooting Tips are on pages 20-21. This model was made by Thomson, the "GE" of France.I have used this product for a few months without a problem. A local library has used this model for years. My previous machine (another brand) lasted over ten years until it failed after a thunderstorm cut power; its buttons no longer worked after power was restored."
I'm using this item to connect my Canon Mini DV camcorder to a Panasonic DVD Recorder and it works fine. I would point out the connectors are not gold plated as they appear in the picture.
I liked the &quot;old&quot; e755 with 2002, and now it's even better with PPC 2003. Never had a problem with my unit, and the new OS does seem a bit faster, having been optimized for the XScale. Battery life is also a bit better, especially when using wi-fi, which is a very good thing.
HP Deskjet 840C PrinterThis inkjet printer is designed for the home or small office. It attaches to a computer via the classic parallel cable or to a USB port. You should connect the USB cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the printer. It can be used with Windows 3.1, 95 via parallel port, or 98, Me, and XP via USB. The black inkjet cartridge is the #15, the tricolor inkjet cartridge is the #17. The #17 tricolor cartridges is often harder to find. This printer works well for the average user. When installing the printer you may have to create a USB Virtual printer port if another printer was previously defined (not for printers connected to a parallel port).HP seems to have a policy of planned obsolescence" in manufacturing new printers that use new inkjet cartridges. Over time it becomes harder to quickly purchase replacement cartridges. If you bought a used printer you can refer to another HP printer manual for general advice. HP advises against refilling a cartridge but you may find doing this useful.The HP840C User's Guide has a Table of Contents that covers the topics in its 74 pages. Be sure to read the warnings in the manual about proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. One user had a problem with the separate power supply. It is probably not good practice to keep the printer powered on when not in use. Like other HP printers the paper path takes a U-turn in printing so the printer uses less desk space. Be sure the bottom tray is pushed against the printer body, a loose fit can cause printing problems. [I bought this at a local yard sale w/o power supply, truly a bargain.]"
The BNC connector is very common. Being able to built one into your project has become more difficult since rat shack quit stocking parts in favor of cell phones. Fortunately Amazon was there to the rescue.There are two types of BNCs that I bought for a project, one that uses a double-D hole to prevent rotation and this flange mount design.In the end my project has a professional appearance as I tapped the case for the 4 screws and drilled a clearance hole for the center conductor to pass through. With so many cables terminated in BNC connectors, having a female BNC to connect to them is almost mandatory if you design circuits on your own.You can also go to L-com and get a catalog of all the RF parts they sell here at amazon. Their shipping is very reasonable so I picked up some other connectors I'd needed in the past.
Denon makes a lot of professional video equipment that costs tons of money, but this consumer-oriented DVD player, one of the few models on the market today that support DVI all-digital output, is both affordable and high-quality.A quick note: at least two other manufacturers (V! and Sansung) also have DVI-capable DVD players. But according to websites like extremetech, they give poor video output.Chances are, if you are reading this review, you probably already know what DVI is. For those that are new to the topic, DVI (digital video interface) is a true digital-only connection between a video source (e.g., DVD player) and a display. The signal that travels over the DVI cable is pure digital, as opposed to the analog signal over component, S-video and composite video cables. What does this mean? You get noise-free image on a DVI-capable TV set. Most namebrand HDTV sets now come with DVI input, e.g., Sharp, Panasonic, Pioneer, Sony, Hitachi.So, in order to take full advantage of this Denon player's digital output, you need an HDTV with a DVI connector. Once you couple the two together, you'll be amazed at the image quality. Not only is the DVI-driven video noise-free, but the image is also brigher. The Denon also features what's known as up-scalers". Since current DVD movies are *not* HD -- they are of the standard NTSC (or PAL, if you are in Asia or Europe) resolution -- the upscaler can magically make the DVD video appear HD. I don't know all the technical details of how this is done, but the upshot is, the image quality is improved and you'll be getting every bit of digital quality of your DVD movies.With some good DVD players selling for less than $50 -- e.g., my everyday DVD player is the $45 CyberHome slim-and-small progressive-scan player bought at Radio Shack -- is the Denon worth the extra money? The answer is a resolute yes, if you have a DVI-capable HDTV set. Seriously, if you have an HDTV, you *need* this player. Otehrwise you are not getting the best DVD playback. The Denon is actually a great buy, considering that the other DVI DVD players on the market today don't perform well. The Denon works, and works well. Any videophiles who lack the deep pocket of a professional or dedicated fanatic, should get this. Once you go DVI, you won't go back."
I recently purchased this product for use in my C64 printer, and the only difference that I saw was the ink lasted much longer then the Epson ink.
After using an annoying fuzzy and crackling Belkin Tunecast, I went out to find a cassette adapter for my iRiver player. I bought this one since it was made by Sony and it was fairly cheap.As far as sound goes, it's very good. Unfortunately, there is a buzzing sound during music. I've found that raising the player's volume instead of the cassette player's makes the buzz go away at higher volumes. At low volumes, unfortunately, there will be a noticeable buzz (especially when wearing headphones). However, for the price, the sound is just right as far as the output. Decent bass, good treble, nice mids, it barely (if at all) makes changes in the sound of the player's output.As far as durability, seems to be up to par from most generic cassette adapters. I'm sure it will last awhile, however a lot of the reviewers have been complaining about it only lasting a few months, so be careful.The price is pretty good, but shame on Target as I bought it there for $19.99 and the price on their website is $13.49.Overall, as long as your not too picky, and you get it around the list price, you should definitely be satisfied.
The only issue I have with this computer is its weight. It is fast, blessed with a great screen, has every port you could possibly want, and even has a swift DVD burner to boot. But it is a behemoth at 10 pounds. The Apple 17&quot; Powerbook weighs 7 pounds, and has a longer lasting battery and a much more svelte and attractive form factor. Too bad it is 1300 clams (!) more expensive!!!Basically, this is a true desktop replacement model. And it will save you on your electric bills relative to your typical 300-watt desktop, as well as desk space...The size is sure to impress your friends, but it is almost too unwieldy and huge for couch computing, and you can forget working on it while in coach.Enjoy!
As usual, on time delivery and product as expected. Well done Amazon!I will definately buy again.
I bought this TDK 3-pack 8cm DVD-RW discs for my Panasonic VDR-D300 camcorder. I've been using two of the three discs; haven't opened the last disc yet. The discs seems quite reliable and they work well in my Panasonic VDR-D300. I also bought TDK's 5-pack 8cm DVD-R discs; I'll review those as well.BTW, the DVD-RW disc can be re-written and/or re-formatted about 1,000 times total, but I've heard that after 500 or so times write and read speeds will drop off dramatically. This compares to up to 100,000 times for DVD-RAM, which is also used by Panasonic's DVD camcorders.
Maxell manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape make it good for recording lectures and music using standard, less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback sound will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.If you pay the Amazon price of $6.99 for the package of seven tapes you spend roughly 99 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the Maxell XL-II. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.
I have probably close to a dozen hosa adapter cables by now - and they are top notch quality cable. These are just as good, it just happened that my only 1/4 TR to 1/4 TR male to male connectors were 25 feet long and mono (separated meant to make the run from the mixer to the amped speaker) - well I use speakon connectors for that anyways. I've been using the coiled up 25' lines too long to patch in a device on my mixer and finally broke down to buy a set of these. At 6.5 feet they are ideal for interconnecting 1/4 TR devices to my stereo inpus on the mixer. And being a dual cable they don't get tangled into a mess. Finally hosa's lable on the plugs for left/right keeps all in order instead of mixing up the same color black cables meant to head to speakers.I'm glad to have purchased this set - now I have a more complete pathcord kit for audio mixing. Hosa's quality stands head and anltlers above the rest.
I am very pleased with the case itself. The click wheel cover is extremely well designed and the case fits snuggly around my iPod. The plastic cover which comes with the case could use some serious help. I was able to get it on with somewhat minimal bubbles, well enough to where I could see the screen anyway.
I've had this for almost a year now. It's a high-quality CD player that also plays back MP3 files burned on CD-R/RW discs. It's very power-efficient and uses only one AA battery which lasts a long time (if you use alkaline). The buttons arrangements need a bit getting used to and to do random play requires going through a menu, but the player is otherwise easy to operate. The build quality is very satisfying as I've dropped this a few times but it still works beautifully unscathed. CD players are still the best for getting the most out of CD music, esp. classical music, which I love.
Synergy Digital Charger with Four AA BatteriesThis charger with its four AA NiMH 2800mAh rechargeable batteries is very useful for any high drain digital camera. You may have to reset the camera to use NiMH batteries instead of the more usual alkaline batteries. You can also use it to charge AAA batteries (used in some cameras).Remember to remove the plastic covering on each battery before charging. It can take 4 to 6 hours with a new battery. The batteries are charged in pairs, two on the left and two on the right. You will see a red light when it is charging. It turns to green when the battery is charged. You should carry a spare set so your photography can continue when the batteries are low.There is a plug to allow this unit to be used on a 240v line (common in Europe and other countries).
It is a question that all digital camera enthusiasts ask themselves shortly after purchasing a digital camera, but it is one that is not easily answered as there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. This review will help to guide you to the best solution based off the characteristics and specifications of the Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera. I feel I am qualified to provide this information as I was in the memory industry for 7 years but having left the industry a year ago, I can be completely unbiased on this subject.One of the biggest factors to consider is the megapixel rating of this Samsung camera. Considering this particular camera is generally considered to be a 4MP digital camera. You can expect to store approximately 32 images on a 64MB card, 64 pictures on a 128MB flash card, 128 digital pictures on digital film of 256MB capacity, 256 pics on a 512MB picture card, 512 images on a 1GB media card, 1,024 photos on a 2GB flash card, and a monstrous 2,048 digital photos on a 4GB card. These image/picture calculations assume that you are going to utilize the full potential of your camera but won't shoot in RAW mode. In other words, the estimates are for shooting at the highest JPEG setting available for the Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera. Understand that they are indeed estimates and can vary based off the actual scene or subject being shot and the amount of light, color variation, detail, etc. in the photo. You can assume these numbers are accurate within 10%.However how many images a card can hold is not the only factor you should consider before buying this all important accessory. You should also consider that you may want to use your Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera to take shots of sporting events, wildlife, or even your child's unique expressions. These moments have a very small window of opportunity to get the shot you desire thus a flash card that has been rated by experts as being a faster card may be something to consider. In my opinion, it is always best to find a review of a flash card as it performed in your specific digital camera. Some cameras just work better with specific flash cards do to the software, firmware, buffer utilization, etc. between the camera and the flash card. Finding an answer to this question is not usually an easy task. There is, though, a superb website that not only offers flash card reviews but also has an extensive user forum that can answer this all important question for you. You may want to take a look at dpreview dot com and then do a search for the Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera in the forums area, if that doesn't work just do a search on Samsung and you should be able to find someone that can help you. I am fairly certain you will have plenty of information to make an informed buying decision. You may also want to look at their detailed review of this particular camera as well if you have not yet decide on whether to purchase it.Of course one of the next factors to consider is in regards to price. Please, do not make the mistake that I have made of buying the absolute cheapest flash card. Take a look at the factors I have mentioned here before you make a purchase. Think of a flash card for your Samsung camera as an extension to it. Just as you wouldn't purchase the cheapest camera case for your camera (personally I own the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack but I like the extra room and the backpack style, which may not be your cup of tea) don't necessarily purchase the cheapest flash card either. Keep in mind that you will use this card every single time you use your camera. Like I said it is truly an extension of your digital camera.The final thing I will mention is in regards to service. There are a number of flash card suppliers in the world today. However all of the flash cards are actually built by a handful (3 - 5) of companies and even those companies only have a few options (2 - 4) regarding which components they are going to use in their particular design. More or less, the actually hardware inside each flash card is going to be similar but the way in which they utilize that hardware and the level of support they will provide, given there is a problem, are more paramount. Just imagine going 10 days without a flash card for your camera (which I did) because you are waiting for some company to repair your flash card, or worse yet having it fail and having no recourse. There are a couple of manufacturers that do very well in regards to utilizing technology and providing customer service. As of the time of this writing they are SanDisk, Lexar, and Viking. However check the newsgroups and forums for the latest information as it can be very cyclical and unfortunately can take a turn for the worse overnight.No matter what flash card you decide to use with your digital camera make sure you take the time to take the pictures. Time flies by fast and having thousands of images to thumb through 5 years from now to remind you of the time that has gone by will be the most powerful investment of all. I have personally purchased a SimpleTech external hard drive to store my images on (another reason I like the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack as it gives me room to put in my hard drive). The hard drive combined with the backpack allows me to take my photos with me when I go visit family and friends. I use PhotoShop exclusively to do all my photo editing and batch processing (a great feature of PhotoShop) and of course make occasional backups to DVD-RW.Enjoy your Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera. I hope this review has informed you how this camera can be best enhanced by a flash card and the best approach in finding one that meets your specific needs.
OK - I realize it's a sin to put Olympus cameras into a Canon bag but my video is all Canon and my stills are all Olympus - so if you shoot with the E series OLY cams, this bag has no problems with other brands.Negative - I took this on a 15 day cruise loaded with 3 E-300 backs and 3 lenses to avoid changing lenses. The only thing I would do differently is NOT use the velcro pockets on the side for ANYTHING of value. Everytime you step on or off the ship, you do the entire X-ray, cavity search, etc TSA routine. I lost alot of small stuff out of the side pockets. Their flaps let small stuff leak through the TSA security x-ray and bucket brigade.Positives. I used this solidly every day for 15 days to cary 3 ea E-300 backs, 1 50mm prime lens, 1 14-54 mm zoom, and 1 50-200 mm along with a teleconverter, 2 flashes (a long range and a ring flash), and a 300+ volt rapid recharge flash accessory for short recharge times, typically under 1/2 second. There are plenty of pockets - as I mentioned the side pockets are vulnerable to loosing contents inside Xray machines, but the main compartment is amazing. The straps that crosshatch the back did a great job holding the strobe power supply while allowing the coiled cord to exit to the strobe attachment point - it was a very effective system even allowing the rapid strobe charger to run and to stay cool while in the pack.All backs were carried mated to their associated lens - avoiding the risk of changing lenses in the field. The main camera back had the dual battery accessory on it - the two smaller ones did not and went face to face like lenses with padding. All of this, plus the macro hardware went in the main compartment. If I were not on a ship with narrow passages, I could have tied my tripod to the two straps under the main bag but I chose not to as I'd get stuck in so many tight spaces if I did. There are also two heavy mounted 1 strap ties on the sides that can be used to attach other cases to the pack.Padding is very generous inside the main compartment, so your preciuos cargo is protected against drops and mishandling by those people who keep us safe (HINT - put UV filters on all lenses before traveling - TSA likes to touch the glass on your lens to make sure its not a bomb)I was simply amazed that I could carry so much in a compact backpack, have it organized ready to pull the right camera for that quick shot, and still have every accessory needed for a full day's shooting on the run. Empty, the pack is very light and adds little weight to your overall load. The zippers are all well attached to handle some stretching - they held up well without damage. All cameras survived the trip and the bag looks good as new. It was, of course, my carry on item, so it got the most scrutiny and fingerpoking by TSA's "challenged" employees.If you are planning a trip with cameras and accessories, this *IS* the best way to make it through security and still have working equipment on the other side. I doubt you will find anything as well thought out at a camera store for this price either.I did not try fitting any video equipment in this pack as it travels in a hard pelican case. Holding 3 D-SLR cameras and all accessories speaks volumes as to its ability though. This is a keeper for traveling and just general storage."
It just amazes me how DVD players are now inexpensive commodities, just four years after I bought my first DVD player, a Panasonic that cost me a small fortune (the price of being the first on the block to have a DVD player).I was at least a bit skeptical about this Chinese DVD player, but since it's so cheap and the reviews here seem generally positive, I gave it a try. Boy is it a very capable DVD player. The exterior is a stylish silver and the player mechanism handles all my DVDs and DVD-Rs and CDs and CD-R/RWs with utmost grace. Setting up was a breeze, as was expected of a DVD player these days, although the instructions can make you laugh.At this time the unknown factor is the machine's long-term reliability. But so far it looks durable and works fine, and frankly for such a low price (even without the Amazon.com exclusive rebate), it's already a winner.
I print alot of photo's, and got tired of paying the highest prices for Epson cartridges, so i tried Rhinotek. I am quite impressed there is no difference in quality, the only difference is in the price.
The most amazing thing about the Shuffle, bar none, is its weight. Actually, it's weightlessness. You don't know that you are wearing it. If you pick it up, it feels like a piece of plastic holding air. At .78 ounces, that's the equivalent of 20 small paper clips.The first time I held one in my hand, I knew I had to have one. Never thought I could convince my wife to spend three H's on a big iPod, and with a cell phone and a PDA already, didn't need another weighty device hanging off of me.Enter Shuffle.I've had it for the past few weeks. The lack of a screen is a small minus. Sometimes it would be nice to know what's coming next, or find a particular track. But it's easy enough to skip if you hit one you don't want to hear -- which is rare, because after all, it's your music.Sound quality is fine. Battery life is OK, too, about 10-15 hours.Now, for the quibbles. Charging the Shuffle is a pain. You have to have it plugged into a USB port. I don't know about your desktop, but mine is on the floor, and it's a pain to plug and unplug. It's no problem on the laptop. Also, it takes 4 hours to fully charge. That's weak compared to the competish. (It's like, who cares that you have USB 2.0? You could USB 0.000001 and still transfer the songs in 4 hours.) There should be a quick charge option, an adapter, or something similar. You can get a docking station, but that defeats the $99 price point. Sony's offering a similar enough player with 70 hours (!), although it's a bit heavier and doesn't work with iTunes.Transferring songs is also a pain. There are hacks using the Shuffle in disk mode -- others here or on iPod web sites can tell you how to do it -- but directly uploading songs from Shuffle to computer is made difficult as a bar (albeit a low one) to piracy. I'm sure Apple is trying to keep the record labels happy, but it should be easier.Anyway, the last few weeks I've rediscovered my music collection -- another plus of the Shuffle. Although you can set up playlists, I prefer random. I've listened to great tunes I forgot I had. Old Santana, Marley, Zeppelin and U2 mixed with a little Green Day turns my grocery shopping into a groovy concert. And I've had probably 20 people ask me what's hanging around my neck. (19 positive, 1 jerk who joked that it looked like an alarm for elderly people for when they fall and can't get up).Final thought -- get the 512, not the 1 Gig. There is no point having more music (16 hours) than battery life (12 hours) without a screen. 120 songs is just fine 99 percent of the time.Enjoy!
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Kingston 64MB CompactFlash CARD, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
This 32 Aquos model is more expensive than another 32" Aquos model because this one has a built-in HDTV tuner. If you don't want the hassle of another device on your desk, this may be worth the extra money. But I'd go with the cheaper model, esp. considering HDTV is still a maturing standard and HDTV services such as VOOM come with the right tuner.Otherwise, both Aquos sport the same top-quality, 5th-generation LCD panel made by Sharp. This is the highest-rated panel in the industry. Not only great specs in terms of contrast and brightness, but in actual viewing you'll find the screen a high performer in areas such as black levels where most other LCDs fall short."
Last year (2003) I bought an earlier variant of this same series and have been very happy with my PC. The current C2310 is very similar to what I bought, so I'll just review this from my experience.For my money, when I buy a laptop, I want it to be of the highest quality. I'm paying serious money, and I expect to rely on the laptop for a couple years before upgrading (well, in my case I upgrade more often than that), so I want -- and you should, too -- to buy a machine with high-quality parts.Dell and Gateway, from my experience with their products, seem to use cheap parts that break easily. So what if you buy an on-site warranty? If your PC breaks down (like my Dell desktop does every so often), you still have to spend hours on the phone with some person from India who cannot speak proper English (in David Pogue's words, they do one side of an SNL skit), and then after wasting hours of your time, they reluctantly agree to send a technician over. Then you'll have to wait for that guy to come over the next day (or, if you called support after 5 pm central time, on the third day -- and this is assuming you have next-day service, otherwise you'll have to deal with the hassles of shipping the thing back), and you have no idea what time he or she will show up or if he or she can fix the problem. So, let's assume you save a couple hundred bucks on your purchase, but in the end, because the parts are low-quality, you suffer.Anyway, this is why I like my Fujitsu laptops. They are all very high-quality. I'm not affiliated with Fujitsu in anyway (check my profile), and I definitely don't know if you could pick up a lemon or not. But in my exprience, Fujitsu computers work fast, are well designed and built, and always beat my ever-rising expectations.The C-series is meant as a value-oriented desktop replacement. Even though their prices are competitive vis-a-vis Dell and Gateway and HP, their quality is far superior to the other manufacturers. These are *solid* machines. They are not hyped-up speed demons that eventually melt down. They don't look glamorous junkies with a defective motherboard. They are just solid tools. Whether you surf wirelessly or do you personal finance or write your next Harry Potter-buster or burn DVDs and CDs, the Fujitsu's get the work done.It's sad that a bunch of moron are running Fujitsu's marketing department. Once again, it proves that good engineering and manufacturing cannot sell products. Dell makes low-quality products but they make people believe they are good. The world is such an unfair place, isn't it?
I bought this for backup for my Canon IXUS I. Works great! Definitely useful to have for travelling and long photo sessions.
Length:: 1:00 MinsThis is a great set of general-purpose binoculars - great for people watching, bird watching in a park (probably not in the wild since the 7x zoom is powerful enough), even theater outings. The build is high quality and the binoculars feel really good in the hands. For the price charged here on Amazon.com, this is an excellent product at a great value.Now, can you see the birds in my video clip? The distance is about 20-25 yards. (Shot through the left lens, with my Fuji camera lens set to wide-angle.) I also show you the multi-lingual instructions sheet, the case, the binoculars, the box, and the eyepiece caps. Not shown is the wrist strap.
The Optio S, the smallest digital camera that's not a toy, makes a perfect gift this holiday season. Words cannot describe how small and compact it is -- especially if you don't even know what a mint tin looks like! Chances are, you've seen people carry this small wonder, perhaps at the World Trade Center memorial site or Central Park or David Letterman show. It's one of the things that prompt you to ask, Wow, what is *that*!" Well, it packs 3 megapixels and 3X optical zoom, and come with all the amenities you find in a modern digital camera, such as a real-time LCD viewfinder and a bunch of settings that, alas, require frequent trips to the user's guide. But, you'll take comfort in the fact that Optio S's basic functions are really easy to master. It's what the Asians affectionately refer to as a "moron's camera", so easy to use anyone can pick up and shoot right away.There's some controversy regarding the picture quality out of Optio S. I recommend you experiment with it and find the best combination of settings for you. (This suggestion applies to all cameras anyway.) And be sure to get an extra memory card and set the picture resolution and image quality settings to maximum.... I highly recommend the dimunitive yet powerful Optio S. Another model I also love is the Minolta Dimage Xt, which is a little more expensive but has the advantage of a periscope zoom lens. Now how cool is *that*?"
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The PNY 64MB CompactFlash Flash Memory Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

I won't repeat the wealth of information the other kind reviewers have already given. I'll just focus on why I decided to cough up the extra $100 to get the SB-800 instead of the less powerful SB-600.Compared to the SB-600, the SB-800 has the following extra features:1) Much more powerful, as reflected in the GN.2) Slightly faster recycle time with the standard four AA batteries. It also comes with a battery holder that holds a fifth battery which cuts down recycle time by 1/3 to 1/2.3) The SB-800 has non-TTL auto and auto aperture modes. (More on this later.)4) In wireless remote mode, the SB-800 can act both as the master and slave, whereas the 600 can only be a slave.5) It comes with a useful diffusion dome, which won't even fit on the SB-600.6) The SB-800 package also includes two colored gel filters.7) The SB-800 can do repeating flash (in the same exposure), for a strobe effect.Basically, both the 600 and 800 support Nikon's latest flash technologies, i-TTL (supported by the D70 and D2H only) and CLS (creative lighting system), in addition to all the TTL (through the lens) flash modes Nikon introduced in the past. The 600 is really a prosumer-level flash that's either TTL or manual, whereas the 800 is pure pro-grade with a lot of modes and options. The manual, evidently written by a Japanese manual writer, attests to its sophistication; understanding the manual will really require a Ph.D. in yoga so you don't stress yourself out.The 800's auto modes are what won me over in the end. The auto modes can set the flash output automatically on Nikon bodies that do not support any TTL (through the lens) mode. On those bodies, with the 600 you'd have to resort to manual, which is simply a pain in the butt, not to mention prone to error. The two non-TTL auto modes on the 800 are auto aperture and auto. You'll need to study the manual very carefully to figure out the difference; I still haven't, but I'm already enjoying the auto aperture mode. The availability of auto modes also means the 800 can be used on a wide range of Nikon bodies than the simpler 600.If you are deciding between the 600 and the 800 like I was, ask yourself the following questions:1) Do you have an extra $100-$150 to spend? If yes, the 800.2) Do you plan to use the external flash a lot? If yes, the 800.3) Do you have Nikon bodies (usually older manual ones) that do not support TTL (you can find out in the camera's user's guide)? If yes, the 800.4) Do you plan to do a lot of wireless flash photography and take full advantage of Nikon's Creative Lighting System? If yes, the 800.5) If you want to get a diffusion dome that fits the flash, get the 800.In the end, I think the SB-800 is a better long-term investment than the SB-600, despite the higher price. It's much more powerful and flexible, and even though it's an overkill for me right now, I imagine when my flash photography improves (and I'm trying very hard right now), it'll prove a very worthy investment.Feel free to drop me an e-mail at hotmail with any questions. BTW, if anyone knows of a good web forum that discusses how to use Nikon's flash modes and the CLS, please let us know. Thanks.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media CANADA ONLY 256MB SD CARD, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Okay, headphones are a pain in the a$$! Trust me, you need to go through thousands to find the right ones. Let's get on with the review!Sound Quality (4/5) - The sound quality on these is far by good. The bass is very deep, not too deep, but having bass too deep IS a problem (can't hear anything but BOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!). If you wanna hear deep bass, put pressure on these. Feel discomfort from the clip and have a headache for the amount of bass. Congrats! You've become an idiot! Anyway, the volume on these is quite loud, but not quite as loud as Sony's h.ear, but the treble is better. Who says you can have it all (if you've ever heard anyone tell you that you can have it all, please hit their head with a shovel)?Comfort (5/5) - Now, if you read the packaging (which contains someone who looks a lot like Jennifer Lopez, btw), it states things about comfort. Well, those are in fact all true. These headphones are VERY comfortable, and at times I can't notice they're on. Definite 5 stars in comfort.Design (3/5) - Ok, design is good and awful. Let me break it down:Good:- The cord is long. Why good: This would be good for people using these for computering, studio monitoring, video/music editing, things that NEED a long cord.- The cord is made with strong plastic. Why good: This would be good for bike or ATV riding. Cords get damaged from being hit with a helmet, or just in the air. This is perfect for that, and other similar rough activities.- The plug is gold plated. Why good: This would be good for most audiophiles and people (freaks) who detail every little thing in every song. Gold plated plugs also seem to be louder than silver plugs.- The hook is a spring hook. Why good: For people with elf ears (pointy ears), this will make it easier to fit on.Bad:- The hook is a spring hook. Why bad: This is the biggest negative of this headphone. The spring hook, makes the speaker go away from the ear, taking out bass and volume that all those audiophiles (and freaks) just love. Why else is this bad: This also make it leak sound. This is a pain for people listening to loud music, which make a little distraction for people sitting next to you (like a bus, or classroom, or a public place).Features (5/5) - Yay! A positive! The features on the w.ear are pretty great. Firstly, the interchangeable covers is a nice touch, and there are blue and silver to choose from. The silver sure looks nice next to my SLCT582V, and the blue would look nice on more colored objects (such as a bright colored CD player, Sony's new PSYC players to be specific). As I said, the spring clip is a big positive and a big negative. So yeah, there may be only two features, but these are headphones, you're not getting a thousand features on them.Portability (5/5) - Ok, pictures mean nothing. Yeah, their clip design". That's what I like to call advertising. Not all clip designs are slim, but that is what Sony and the picture are making you think. Even though these DO happen to be very slim, fair warning. Anyway, these are very slim. Slimmer than my slim design CD player. So, these are very portable.Price (4/5) - The price for these are surely not a bargain, but they aren't overpriced. The price is set about just right. Most headphones with these features would be also around the $20 mark.Who they might be for: These headphones would be for people who aren't TOO picky about audio quality, but still want decent sound from them. People who might be using them for long periods of time, or have small-normal sized ears. Maybe for people using computers, or for studio monitoring of some such (but you will need to buy an adapter). People may want to consider these for durability, for maybe people doing sports, bike/ATV riding, or other rough activities. These may be good for people who are using these in not-so-public places, but still travel a lot, or even for home usage. These would be good for people who like interchangeable covers and style.In my opinion, these overall deserve 4 stars. They aren't exactly perfect, but they're damn there close."
iPods change your life. Simple as that. The ability to carry 1,500 songs in your pocket (or a bunch of audiobooks, one of the many free Podcasts of news, commentary or music 'radio,' and your contacts) is still revolutionary.In addition to the iPods, which are clearly best-of-breed devices (in part because they maintain their simplicity instead of adding buggy feature bloat found in competitors), iTunes and the iTunes music store have run rings around its competitors. That's why iPods have 76% market share -- and rising.About the new mini:It gives you iPod-level functionality in a 3.6 oz. masterpiece of engineering, with newly improved 18-hour battery life to boot. Colors add flash and style that make competitors look oh-so-80s.The Click Wheel input takes a few minutes to master and is far more intuitive than anything else on the market -- which are fully of clunky buttons.Another reason to buy an iPod over a competitor: Add-ons. There are literally thousands of products out there for customizing your iPod.Finally, if you are getting this as a gift for someone else, for heaven's sake, don't go for a 'bargain' player. Especially if this is for someone new to digital music. A big part of Apple's genius is its ability to make its software easy to use for all -- heck, even The Queen has an iPod Mini! If she can use one, so can your mom, your grandmother and your kids. Those same people are likely to look at a Rio like it's an alien from another planet, and when they are forced to use that confusing Windows media software, well, that gadget is going to end up on a shelf gathering dust...Enjoy!
Maxell makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust. The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves!The color white is neutral and doesn't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the CD or DVD. You can also fold down the back flap of the envelope and tape it together so that the disc cannot fall out. This ensures that the CDs and DVDs don't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another.They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room.My only qualm is that these are made only from paper so the disc is not quite as well protected as it would have been in a plastic slim jewel disc.Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price. I highly recommend these Maxell CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical and cost-efficient alternative to jewel cases.

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media CANADA ONLY 512MB SD CARD, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

The price here is a bit too high, and shopping around you'll find deals selling this (5GB) for about one hundred fifty. It's quiet, rugged, and has speed comparable to USB 1.1. So no speed champ, but you can now store personal data on the PC Card and take it with you. Or back up your critical data to it. It's plug-n-play if you have Windows XP. A great gadget to have.
This CD tower by Atlantic holds 100 CDs in their jewel cases. It is compact and it's certainly no eyesore. I use this rack to store CDs and I am satisfied.Another wonderful feature of this CD storage tower is that it can be stored just about anywhere, too--at 32 inches high this storage tower is compact while doing the job of storing your CDs in an orderly and presentable fashion.The rack is constructed of black steel wire with cherrywood" knobs. Caution: at this price you shouldn't expect real wood knobs. The "cherrywood" knobs look somewhat like fake wood or laminate. This is a minor disappointment, however.My only complaint is that the CD jewel cases often slide to one side or the other as they rest in their slots in this storage tower. Unless you are rather careful the CDs eventually look a bit disorderly; but again this is a relatively minor complaint and it may not bother you.Overall, if you want an inexpensive CD storage rack this is the way to go. It is affordable and this will last forever. Great for storing your CDs!"
This surge protector from Belkin does an excellent job of protecting your electronic equipment from any damage or problems should there be a power surge. I have used this product for years now without any complaints.The surge protector benefits from a simplistic design; for people like myself this is certainly sufficient to protect my computer and printer. There are six power outlets that also, of course, allow you to protect and plug in six things all at once. Just plug in the surge protector into an electrical outlet and there you are! Everything should be fine.The cord does extend four feet and that's an added plus. You do get a warranty with this mechanism, too.Obviously, I would never use this to light up a fish tank or place it near anything liquid. That could clearly start a fire.Overall, I have had no problems with this Belkin surge suppressor. I highly recommend this product.
This is an excellent network router for sharing a brodband Internet connection...you get a top-performance Ethernet router, built-in firewall, basic content control functions, and ease of set up. I was able to get it up and running in just 5 minutes. One caveat: this is a cable router, so you'll need to run cables between the router and your PCs (up to 4). If that doesn't bother you, this is the best consumer router you can get... and the price is totally sweet.
TDK manufactures excellent, extra high grade six hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have six hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording television shows, for example.In addition, you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time, four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording. (You use your VCR to set this.) The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they're satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The extra high grade of this blank VCR tape ensures that you get longer life out of these blank tapes. Moreover, if you record a special event on these for a permanent video recording the quality of the video on the tape will outshine the quality of the video on the regular version of this VCR tape. Things should look sharper" and be a little bit more in focus, too.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable, blank extra high grade VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record. I have used this brand and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK extra high grade six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape."
Ok, so recently I stepped on my Earhugger A1000 Action Wrap Headphones. Unfortunately, they sounded good and fit really well. When I went back to BL they were all out. So I tried a pair of RPHS34 headphones by Panasonic (my review didn't go through and don't feel like writing one). They sound good and fit well but leaked way too much sound. So I ordered a pair of JVC earbuds on Amazon which I will review when they arrive. So on to these Koss P4 earbuds. I didn't buy them. These came with a set of big Koss headphones and since my friend can't stand earbuds, they passed these up to me. Hey, how can I pass down something that's free? Since they were really cheap and the reviews for these were bad I expected these to suck but really these are some good earbuds given the low price.I tried these on some of my music and sounded pretty good, not great but much better than others claim. Just with the EQ off these sounded good. The bass is actually pretty rich to me comparing the Sony MDRE828LP and the Earhugger A1000. These don't provide near as much bass as those that cost much more but do sound good enough for their purchase. Mids sounded fine, But as with most of the cheaper earbuds I noticed a bit much in the 200-500k range. These also provide a good lcean sound to them, you don't hear fantastic detail but you can hear most of which comes out of your tunes. Overall, above average sound quality. Not excelling in anything but not failing in anything.I've also heard that these are too big. Yes, they are larger than most, but with the provided pads on them they fit my rather SMALL ears just fine. These aren't for running or excercising, if you are looking for something on that matter you may want to pick up the Koss KSC22 or the Sony MDRJ10. These don't fall out when walking but any vigorous activity will just not work with these headphones.One thing you MUST know is about the lifetime warranty. Yes, they come with the lifetime warranty. But unless you bought these in the pack with the big headphones, the warranty is pretty useless since you have ot send in five bucks to get them repair. Somewhat a ripoff if you look at the price listing for these seperately.Overall, a good middle-of-the-road chose for those looking for somethnig with good sound and are comfortable and don't want to spend a ton. They are no where near the best headphones you can buy, nor are they the best sub ten, but for a cheap and well suitable replacement for your iPod or other portable player, these are it. 4 stars.
This laptop by Sony has been good to me for a while now and I recommend it for people who are on the go but yet do not need the very latest and greatest in technology. The Intel Centrino processor works fine. I have no complaints although, of course, at 1.5 GHz it's not the fastest processor out there. It works fine for me, though. The RAM I added to have the laptop be able to use a full gigabyte of RAM has not interfered with hibernation, as another reviewer experienced.The case DOES scratch easily; and the sound is fair. I use earphones that let me increase the sound beyond what the computer is capable of producing; and that's an obvious plus. The keyboard is much tighter and smaller than a desktop keyboard and this took some getting used to. I wound up buying a mouse to avoid that pad upon which you slide your finger to control the cursor and mouse pointer on the screen.You will need a special cleaner to wash the screen--this screen is not made of glass but fortunately the cleaning products are relatively affordable.In addition, I really like that this comes with a combination CDRW--DVD drive. I have often used this to watch movies while I travel or lie in bed just lazing around on a Sunday afternoon. The drive works very well and there are no software issues so far for me.As Amazon notes, you get Norton anti-virus software and Microsoft Works with this and all this and more runs on the Windows XP Home Edition operating system, which is fine with me. There are ports and more to make this laptop exactly the way you personally want it to be. Excellent!Overall, this laptop is very solid. Sure, the smaller keyboard took some getting used to; but that came in time. This little computer's got a lot of life in it; and I think you'll be able to make good use of it. If you still have any questions, you can download the product manual from this website or you can also read the product description above. The other reviews are well done, too.
The RF-11 assembly is designed to take advantage of the bayonet mount found on all 67 mm filter assemblies and the FR-1 adapter tube for the 50mm macro lens (the FR-1 forms an extention tube in front of the lens to protect the full focus extension and has the 67 mm filter thread needed for the TF-22 and also the 67mm bayonet system needed for the RF-11)I have no idea why amazon says it needs the SR-1. The SR-1 is ONLY for the TF-22, in fact they say the TF-22 needs the SR-1 - the TF-22 SHIPS with the SR-1. Amazon needs to correct this error because the SR-1 is hard to find anywhere!. It also doesn't need the FR-1 unless you have the 50mm macro lens.The RF11 will lock onto the 14-54 and the 50-200 mm lenses with just a 30 degree twist to engage the bayonets that normally hold the lens hood. As for a flash, it's as powerful as any GN36, but exceptionally parallel to the lens, with no shadow cast by the lens as with flashes mounted above the lens.For greater light control, the GN22 TF-22 twin flash should be used in extreme cases (and it DOES come with the SR-1 to hold the two flashes - see my reviews on theOlympus TF-22 Twin Flash Head (Needs FC-01 Flash Controller, FR-1 & SR-1)for more info there)Most people will want the ring flash first, and then get to the twin flash when their needs dictate. The extra light from the ring flash makes for some great portrait shots. As with the twin flash, the ring flash has 4 modeling lights in the corners to aid in locating the flash reflection in your composition before shooting. They also come on automatically for focus if you have the AF set to use the modeling lights.This is a specialized flash that can be used out to about 6 meters or so - beyond that I would switch to the FL-50. It can be used down to 6 inches and below that I would switch to the TF-22.One last thing - exposure adjustment is no longer done with the +/- key on the camera when using the lens mounted flashes. TheOlympus FC-01 Macro Flash Controller (for use with TF-22 & RF-11 Flash Heads)has on it a dial for +/- 3 EV stops that controls the flashes directly. The camera exposure control is not active when using these flashes.All together the flash system is very well designed as the high voltage power supplies work with any flash (the FL-50 and FC-01 are in the same body and accept the FP-1 and SHV-01 power supplies). For close up works they can't be beat.
The Creative Nomad Zen Xtra MP3 Jukebox is actually an amazing MP3 player, if you can forgive its relatively large size (when compared to the iPod) and clunky user interface (again, when compared to the iPod). Not only does it have SUPERB sound quality, unmatched by iPod or Rio or iRiver, but it sports some features you won't find elsewhere:- volume leveling, so all your tracks have the same volume- time scaling, so you can adjust the playback speed fast or slow, a boon for people who have audiobooks in the MP3 format (the iPod can only adjust the speed of special Audible files)- sleep timer- alarm clock (!!!)- profile settings that remember your preferences, great for sharing with other family members- pretty decent playlist management- works as an external drive in Windows- removable LiIon batteryThese features are all the more amazing because all recent Creative products (Zen Micro, Zen Touch, ...) do NOT have these features. It's sad to me that Creative has taken a step or two back in all these convenience features, which would have made their products compete better against iPod and others. Just sad.In short, if size and jog dial don't turn you off, the Zen Xtra is the best hard drive-based MP3 player.
I have used Iomega products for seven years now and have never had any problems with their stability, on both PCs and Macs. (Earlier versions of the Zip disk media were another story, if you know what I mean.) The Predator proves itself to be a solid burner with respectable speeds -- if you've got USB 2.0, that is. Without USB 2.0, the Predator achieves speeds of 4x4x6, which according to Iomega is a limit imposed by the slower USB 1.1. On my workhorse Win2k PC with an USB 2.0 adapter card, I'm not sure if I actually get the maximum speed, but I'm happy with being able to create a 60-minute audio CD in about 5 minutes.The sleekly-built Predator installs easily and quickly and, like most new burners, features buffer underrun technology to prevent writing failures. My previous HP external burner was annoyingly sensitive to buffer underrun, and caused half of all my burns to fail even when the authoring software is the only app running. So far I've experienced a less than 10% failure rate on the Predator. Maybe even less than 5%. And I can actually surf many web sites while burning a CD-R, something I couldn't dream of doing with the HP.The Predator is one fine product and actually looks cool, which is not something to be said of most PC peripherals. Please note that this product does not work on Macintoshes. Win98, WinME, Win2k, and WinXP only.
I found Samsung blank CD-Rs at a local dollar store. I thought, what the heck. I only bought 2 CD-Rs. I used the first one on a music mix of 20 songs. Wow, at 52x these are awesome! The burn very fast, and are not faulty.The music was very good sounding. One problem is that it did scratch easily, but that's okay because I own a CD-Case to keep my CDs safe from damage.These CD-Rs were so good, I bought the 10-Pack. Still no faulty ones, besides the first one at the dollar store. If you need just a couple 10 more CD-Rs, this will do very well.
Unlike some lesser brandnames, this Panasonic DVD recorder actually works. I've heard that with some other brands, you can get failed burning sessions, which would waste your blank DVD media. Also, since this Panasonic uses the DVD-R (&quot;dash&quot; or &quot;minus&quot; format) instead of DVD+R (&quot;plus&quot; format), the discs you burn are compatible with *more* DVD players. For my money, I'd stick with DVD-R all the way. Also, be sure to get high-quality blank discs for better recording quality and longer shelf lives.(Ignore the DVD-RAM format. No DVD player I know of except some Panasonic models can read DVD-RAM.)I'm really happy with the great build quality and great price I got with this model. I didn't need one of those Panasonic models with a built-in hard drive, so I saved money. But if you want TiVo-like capabilities, check out those HD-equipped models.The best virtue of this Panasonic is it does a great job at what it's supposed to do. I'm sure better models are already in the channel, so I'd say if you can wait a bit longer, wait a bit longer. Otherwise, the Panasonic is your best bet for value, quality, and durability.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The 512MB Compactflash 12X Hhscanada Only, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

AVthing in its place makes a great record rack! These record racks are scarce--even with an internet search. They are well constructed and I like that the price includes shipping!These attractive record racks won't be an eyesore and they are easy to put together. I am all thumbs" and my handyman, who was over here doing something else anyway, just gave me some quick help with the assembly. These may come without casters but as you can see in the image provided above you can attach casters, especially if you only need one of these units and can therefore rest it on the floor.I have a collection that needs space for more than 100 LPs, so I stacked two of mine. The overall effect is that unless you look closely it appears to be a unit of very, very carefully built storage cubes for record albums. And, in fact, that's what it will be if you buy more than one of these and stack them.The solid hardwood is really pretty good for the price that you pay; and you get to choose between ebony and oak. I picked ebony because it's a more neutral color for my place.Overall, these record racks are terrific for vinyl lovers like me! Of course, if you use them without casters they can be used to store anything else that can fit inside them. Here's hoping you find these as useful as I did."
This record player is really a very good buy considering what you get. Sure, the sound from the single speaker is only about a B+," but if you really want that retro feel and look in every way, including the stackable records feature so reminiscent of the '60s, then this is one of your best choices.It doesn't take up much room and it plays the records very well. You can stack a few albums up (maybe not more than five, though) and just walk away, letting the records spin and the music roll through your house for the duration of five or six sides worth of records! (I wouldn't recommend stacking 78 rpm records; they might be too fragile for that and should be played one at a time.)The wood grain quality looks a little cheap and the iron mesh grille in the front covering the speaker is certainly not the best. Of course you knew that diamond stylus needle wouldn't be the very best diamond stylus needle you could ever buy, either. Nevertheless, it IS a diamond stylus needle--and it IS a sturdy record player.But that's not what you're really buying here. The selling point of this turntable, this record player is the nostalgia, that feeling you get and the memories you recall when you see and hear it play your records. If you're like me and you kept your record albums all these years, you DO value nostalgia and therefore you'll be pleased. After all, it's not like turntables are growing on trees anymore, so this is one of the few opportunities we have left for us record lovers!This model allows you to play 33 1/3 rpm, 45 rpm and even 78 rpm records that are 7 inches, 10 inches or 12 inches in width. There is an automatic return arm and this is a great plus!Overall, this really is a wonderful record player for those of us who remember yesteryears fondly and who want the look and styling of record players from the '50s and especially the '60s. It is not a modern turntable used in clubs in jet set cities; but chances are if you're considering this product a modern day turntable requiring speakers and other equipment isn't what you wanted anyway. I recommend this as an affordable "retro" record player that does the job well and will work well through time. It also comes with six 45 spindle adapters and a user's manual that's actually written in plain English!Enjoy this for years to come! SMILES"
The SL-SV550 from Panasonic is a stylish, lightweight CD player that also works well with MP3 audio files and has a nice built-in radio with both AM and FM bands. This model is not the sporty, rugged type Panasonic also sells, but nonetheless exhibits the highest build quality. (Made in Japan.)Pros:- Incredibly long battery life on two AA batteries. Takes both alkaline (1.5Vx2) and NiMH (1.2Vx2) types of batteries. The battery indicator has four levels: 1-3 bars, plus no bar to indicate low battery. I've played a mixture of audio CDs, MP3 CD-Rs and radio for over a week on two fresh AA alkalines from Walgreen's, and there are still 1-2 bars left. Just incredible. The use of standard AA batteries also means to need to buy expensive proprietary batteries or carry a charger. NOTE: if you use NiMH batteries, due to their low initial voltage, the indicator may exhibit only 1-2 bars from the start, but the NiMH batteries will actually last longer. This is speaking from my experience with other Panasonic CD/MP3 players (e.g., SX70/80).- Very clean sound. The bundled headphones are ok, but I use a set of noise-cancelling earbuds, and the sound from the Panasonic is very clean and pleasant. The bass, even when boosted, is not too strong, but that's fine with me as excessive bass gives me headaches. There's plenty of volume from the radio and audio CD plays, but MP3 audio can be a bit too soft, so you may want to get a pair of volume-control headphones.- Compatible with audio CDs, CD-R and CD-RW burned with audio CD tracks, CD-R and CD-RW burned with MP3 or WAV files. I've tried a good many number of MP3-filled CD-R discs, some even scratched, and the Panasonic has no trouble with any of them. Some notes here: 1. When creating an MP3 CD be sure to put files in different root-level folders, with no more than 12 in each folder. The Panasonic strives for simplest controls, at the expense of extensive file navigation. The use of folders simplifies skipping to the album (folder) and track (file) you want. The player does remember the last track/file played, unless you change discs. 2. This player does not display ID3 tags, only track number and elapsed time. This is more a CD player that can support MP3 files, rather than a dedicated MP3 player. For the latter, you might as well go for an iPod, Rio or RCA Lyra.- Great radio functions. Very good reception, better than my dedicated portable radio, and deafeningly loud at the max volume. Twenty FM presets and ten AM presets. Very easy to program.- Anti-skip that works flawlessly. You shouldn't drop this unit, though, as it's not designed to be dropped.- Stylish and lightweight. Only 6 ounces with two AA batteries.Minor cons:- Cannot search within an MP3 track. You can search within audio CD tracks, but not within MP3. No big deal for music, but inconvenient for MP3 audio books.- Small buttons. Buttons are responsive but not laid out logically, and they are all too small. A few times I pressed the skip button instead of volume control which I meant to.- Battery compartment is under the CD. My old Panasonic discmen had external battery compartments, but the newer models all put them under the CD, inside. If the door is not closed in place it can pop up and scratch your CD. The engineer who made this switch should be shot. Also, when will Panasonic start using AAA batteries to make these even slimmer?In summary, a great portable CD/MP3 player for the buck. Highly recommended (unless you plan to listen to a lot of MP3s).
This UltraLast rechargeable LiIon battery is an OEM version of Casio's official NP-40 battery for many members of the Exilim family of digital cameras: EX-Z40, EX-Z50, EX-55, EX-Z57, and (I believe) EX-Z750, among others.The official Casio NP-40 costs over $45 here on Amazon (list $49.99), so this UltraLast clone is a great value. Usually I'm very cautious when it comes to generic rechargeable batteries, since the poor-quality ones can explode if over-charged, but I decided to take a bet on this one since it's sold by Amazon. Plus, it actually has more power (1300 mAh) than the Casio one (1230 mAh).I received my UL-CNP40 a couple days ago and so far it seems safe and reliable. Charging takes a little over 3 hours just like with the NP-40 that came with my EX-Z55, and over the weekend I shot a few hundred photos and saw no difference in performance between this and the NP-40.So I think this is a keeper, although, a paranoid that I am, I'll use the Casio NP-40 as my main battery and keep this chareged as a backup. Between these two batteries, I'm confident I can shoot over 500 pictures with LCD and flash on, and probably over 1,000 with LCD off and using the EX-Z55's optical viewfinder.BTW, if you get this or any other battery as a spare, you should also get the Casio rapid charger BC-30L, available here at Amazon for $44 or so. It's a wall plug-in type and you can charge one battery while using the other. (Otherwise you'll have to charge one battery in camera, take it out, and charge the other battery before you head out on your trip.)
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Edge Memory 64MB FLASH MODULE, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Wow these cables are great, for the price and come gold plated. They seem very durable also, with plenty of thickness and shielding.
GREAT!!!! The feeling is rigth, the weigth is rigth and it fits perfectly! It comes with caps for Sony Clie.
When I first reviewed the sleek Visor Edge, it cost about twice what it does today. At the time, I advised buyers that this product was definitely going to come down in price so it can compete. Handspring finally has priced this product where it is extremely competitive with any product in the marketplace.Functionally, the Visor Edge's sole advantage is its thinness. It is by far the thinnest PDA.Functionally, the Edge is identical to the Visor Neo, except it is thinner with a rechargeable battery. This is the Palm OS equivalent of the Apple Cube -- a beautiful machine that didn't justify its high initial cost. As with the Cube after it was discontinued, you can now get a great deal on the Edge.Buyers may also want to check out the discontinued Palm Vx, which feels better in your hands and actually weighs about an ounce less.BTW, putting the Springboard module on this product makes it look totally unwieldy and eliminates the &quot;cool&quot; factor. If you like Springboard, keep your Visor Deluxe/Neo.
When I first saw the Apple iPod socks advertise on Apple.com during the Fall of 2004, I knew I had to have them. Wow. Six colors, a non-bulky way to protect my iPod, and did I mention cool?"In fact, I thought the iPod socks would become intoxicatingly popular, and I expected sellouts and the likes. Unfortunately for Apple, although they have a following, the iPod socks do not seem to be on the top of every iPod owner's buying list. However, I love my iPod socks. I slide my click wheel iPod into the sock of my choice, and I can rest knowing that whether it is sitting on my desk, in my pocket, in the car, or on the table, that it won't get scratched or banged around. Furthermore, the many colors give me a choice to fit my mood. I also slide my ear buds and iTrip into a sock, and it keeps those items tidied up. The socks are incredibly soft, and they are just the right thickness. They are thick enough to provide some protection, but they add very little thickness to the iPod, which is nice. I don't like the big bulky cases.Overall, I'm happy I paid $30 for my iPod socks. For me, it is the coolest accessory out there, and it is an official Apple product!"
The Crosley Stack-O-Matic replacement needle really comes in handy when you're worn out that old needle on your Crosley Stack-O-Matic" phonograph! Now of course I'm showing my age here by reviewing a phonograph needle; but hey, I still like the sound of vinyl record albums when I listen to my music.The needle replacement instructions are very clear on the reverse of the package that you get in the mail when you order the needle. The plastic and thin cardboard package looks exactly like the one pictured above on this webpage. In addition, the replacement needle comes well packed in a bubble wrapped envelope; that's good for when the post office plays soccer with the package as it's en route to your home.One note, however: this needle will only be useful for the Crosley brand "Stack-O-Matic" record players. It is not at all recommended for use on other brands of turntables or other brands of record players--it may not fit or it could break or even do damage to the turntable arm or your records.Although Crosley recommends that you change needles every 1,000 hours of playing time, there are instances in which you will need a replacement needle much, much sooner than this. In my case, I recently wanted to play a record; but the tiny little hole in the middle of the record was just a tad too wide; and therefore the record didn't drop down onto the turntable! When the turntable arm and its needle fell onto the solid surface near the turntable, the needle consequently became slightly damaged. If this happens, the current needle will still play your records but it could easily do damage to the grooves on the records in the longer run; get a replacement needle and install it like I did.Score a huge goal for Crosley with their "Stack-O-Matic" replacement phonograph needle. Grab an extra needle if you want to make sure you always have an extra one on hand--and listen to some tunes TODAY!"
The Fujifilm 1GB Type M" xD flash memory card works in the latest models of digital cameras from Fujifilm, Olympus and other manufacturers that utilize the xD format. The "Type M" designation means this memory card uses on-board compression and decompression as data are written and read. Without the compression, xD memory cards cannot achieve more than 512MB of storage since they are physically so small. This compression, however, does cause incompatibility with older digital cameras that must use the "regular" type of xD card. This means 1) you should check the digital camera's manufacturer website to see if your particular model can use "Type M" xD card; and 2) if not, you can only use up to 256MB xD cards without compatibility concerns.(There's a different kind called "Type H" xD card which uses a different compression scheme than "Type M" cards. I haven't seen any Type H cards being sold in the U.S. yet.)This Fujifilm 1GB card is manufacturered by either Toshiba in Japan or Samsung in South Korea. BE SURE TO GET THE TOSHIBA VERSION! My first two were made by Samsung and both failed after a few uses. Very terrible quality. I almost wanted to write a one-star review here on Amazon. But my third card, which I finally ordered from Amazon, was made by Toshiba and it's been working totally fine even in sub-freezing temperatures. So heed my advice: if your card is marked "korea - made by samsang" be sure to return it and get another one from another store. You just don't want to risk using a poor-quality memory card. Shame on Fujifilm for shortchanging its customers. (Update: I got two from Amazon and both are made by Toshiba.)(Unfortunately, you cannot tell who manufactured the card from the packaging. It just says "Made in Japan or S. Korea." You'll have to cut-open the packaging to see the marking on the back of the card itself. So be sure to buy from a store that allows full-refund returns.)The xD card has pretty good read and write speeds. As I mentioned earlier, the "Type M" designation means the employment of data compression, but this is totally transparent to the user, i.e., you needn't think about it at all. I've read on the web that this compression does entail a small speed penalty, but for all practical purposes you won't notice a thing at all. The bottleneck is usually with the camera I/O (input/output circuirty) so the tiny speed penalty is not going to matter. Again, be sure to get the Toshiba version of this card so ensure highest reliability and speed.In the end, I feel this is a good memory card. And the one I bought from Amazon made by Toshiba has proven itself just as reliable as my Lexar CompactFlash and Secure Digital cards. I haven't had any problems at all. On the other hand, the design specs of the xD card cast a shadow on its future.In terms of performance, I think if you don't need to shoot a lot of pictures at a time, a 256MB xD card, which uses no compression (at least not as much as Type M), is a better choice, both for speed and durability considerations. In fact, I now think I should have gotten 2 or 3 256MB xD cards instead of a single 1GB one. If I store 1,000 pictures on this and it fails, I lose the 1,000 pictures."
This memory card is soooooo much better than the 64MB. My computer runs so much faster and I can put more programs into my computer. The only problem is that I couldn't transfer data from my old 64MB card. It's like owning a brand new computer!
It charges the battery as promised, quick and efficient. It's small and easy to hide. This makes it easy to pack for vacations and adventures, however, it also makes it easy to lose, which is why I'm purchasing another charger. Go figure.
I bought this cooler form Eforcity. I like this product for several reasons:- Lightweight. I carry it to work every day and while traveling.- Compact. Easy to carry whether on travel or not.- Great swivel feature. Great when sharing the screen with the person next to you.- Good for ergonomics. Without it, I find myself shifting my hands to an awkward position or I end up shifting the laptop. Now I just nudge it left or right.
Great quailty, well made and my iPod nano fits in it well. Sound is as good as can be expected considering the size of the speakers.
The iPod Shuffle was announced and made available, in January 2005.I received my iPod Shuffle, about five weeks, afters its introduction, so I have been using it, for over seven months. I should point out that I already had a full size iPod, but I wanted the shuffle, for its small size and extreme portability.The shuffle is incredibly impressive, when you first receive it. Its tiny size and light weight really strikes you as unbelievable.The shuffle charges and syncs to your iTunes library by USB 2.0. Charging takes about three hours, if you want a full charge, and the syncing of songs is pretty fast. You can have the shuffle select the songs randomly from your iTunes library, or choose your own custom mix.I find the lack of display on the shuffle to not be an issue. The reason being is that this shuffle holds about 240 songs, so there really isn't a need, for a display. After all, who wants to be looking at a tiny display? I just want to listen to my music. You can have the shuffle play your songs in the order you setup in iTunes, or have it mix things up, with a random shuffle.The shuffle has been reliable over the past six months. It still works great, looks great, and the battery still lasts close to the specification 12 hours.Overall, I still use my full size iPod, for the majority of the time. However, when I want extreme portability and something that is not weighing down my pocket, I use the shuffle. It is also nice to use, if you're going to be an environment where you're concerned about damage or theft to your iPod, since the shuffle is less expensive. The iPod Shuffle makes a great second iPod, for iPod fans. However, it makes a great first and only iPod, for many people too. The iPod Shuffle brings the convenience of having any song (up to approximately 240 on this model), from your iTunes music library with you, wherever you go. Music makes life a lot of fun, and this shuffle helps bring the music to you.
Embedded Mac OS and Windows 2000, Windows XP driver support, Plug 'n' Play without driver installation compact size for portability with Anti shock design.
I bought this cable from Eforcity becuase it is very cheap and gets many positive reviews. This cable is used to connect my PS3 and the TV in my bedroom, I'm very suprised it provides the excellent performance as same as the Monster cable that is used for my blue-ray player. I like this cable very much and I bought 2 more for my parents.
