This CompactFlash SmartMedia Combo Reader by SimpleTech is a handy tool to have. Instead of transfering files or photos slowly, this is a faster connection. I recommend it.
In today's digital world, there is never enough storage for all my new gadgets like MP3 players and PDAs. I bought Simpletech's 64 MB MMC card to be able to store more files and songs. It works great. It's very small and reliable.
Simpletech's 256MB CF is very fast. I use it with my Canon camera and love it. It gives me quick transfer rates with high resolution. Same time and money and any headaches.
I recommend buying Simpletech's Secure Digital Reader to save time and ease. I use it with my 64 mb secure digital card and Ipaq H3850. It plugs straight into my USB port and was impressed with the transfer rate.
If you own a digital camera and take a lot of pictures and value your own time, then get this. With SimpleTech's 128MB Compact Flash card and reader I'm able to get the most out of my Canon Powershot G2. I can store 200 photos then download them incredibly fast to my PC without wasting my camera battery life or mine.
Simple and easy to use, I wish I had bought one sooner. Save the batteries in your camera and use this Simpletech Reader. Just plug the Compact Flash Card into the Reader and then plug the Reader into the USB port on your PC. With Windows 2000/XP that's ALL you need to do, when finished downloading the pictures just pull out the Reader and remove the Compact Flash Card. I highly recommend this product, I think it's great.
I was very impressed with Simpletech's Bonzai 64 MB. It's small,yet powerful. It is as simple as just inserting it into any USB port and, you have a small, portable disk drive. Really invaluable for transporting files between work and home without the expense and mess of having zip drives on each system or carting around a bulky storage device. Even better for transporting files between Windows and Macintosh computers. No new software to learn once its inserted it just shows up on your system as another disk drive. They should of come up with this sooner.
This marvelous mini drive is my new best friend. Simpletech's 128 MB Bonzai drive is powerpacked. It's fast(1.5 MB/s) and easy to transfer large files like Powerpoint presentations between notebook and desktop, even between Windows and Mac without any drivers! It fits in your pocket and connects to any USB port without any cables or adapters. It's extremely easy to use and even upgradable. I wish I would of had one years ago.
I bought the Simpletech 64 MB compact flash card and was instantly impressed with the added storage capabilities. It's inexpensive and definately worth the added functionality to use with digital cameras, PDA's and MP3 players!
This tiny sized 32 MB multimedia card is well worth the price. I needed some extra storage. Next time I'll buy more capacity but I've been satisfied with this one.
I bought SimpleTech's 128 MB Compact Flash card and have been really happy with it. I use it with my Canon Powershot and enjoy the ability to store many more pixs. The transfer rate is fast too. I took in on vacation and couldn't take enough pixs to fill it up. I'd recommend this card.
I recommend Simpletech's 256MB DDR PC2100. It was easy to install and the results are amazing. It feels like I have a new computer. I can do just about anything. The price was low and the performance is fast.
Simple Tech makes this impressive RAMBUS 128MB RIMM. My computer dramatically increased its speed and performance. It's got a great price and was easy to install. Upgrading is an easier and cheaper solution than buying a brand new computer.
I decided to upgrade my PC with Simpletech's PC133 256MB DIMM. Now I can zip through programs with many windows open and not have to worry about crashing or decreased speed. It was a simple solution to upgrade.
I installed two 128 MB PC2100 DDR by Simpletech and was really estatic about the change. I was able to open more windows and noticed how my computer has been flying fast now. It was a good price and works great.
I am very pleased with the case itself. The click wheel cover is extremely well designed and the case fits snuggly around my iPod. The plastic cover which comes with the case could use some serious help. I was able to get it on with somewhat minimal bubbles, well enough to where I could see the screen anyway.
I can't tell the difference between this one and the real epson, other than I got three times as many cartridges for half the price. Only time will tell if it lasts as long, but frankly at this price that really isn't an issue
The battery fits my ipod nano's battery compartment. It keeps playing while I was charging my nano. Simple to use and worth to buy with such price.
I purchased the Ipod Nano Light skins for my daughter and she just loved them! I thought they were a great value when compared to prices for similar products in the store
It is a replacement inkjet cartridge. It works as well as one would expect. I have never used a different type cartridge to see if the colors are different with this printer. I have used a couple of these replacement cartridges, and they are excellent.
I find this product does the job. I probably could go the cheaper route but I like that it works and lasts quite awhile. I have found Amazon has the best price.
This is a very high quality cable. It has all the right materials, specifically high-performance polypropylene foam dielectric on the signal lines. The connectors are large and solidly molded.
I find this product does the job. I probably could go the cheaper route but I like that it works and lasts quite awhile. I have found Amazon has the best price.
This battery is long-lasting and charge very fast! I bought 2 of it for my Canon camera. Both of it works well!

I'm so glad I shopped around for these cables. If I had bought them at a local electronics big box" store, I would have spent more than five times as much for exactly the same result. There's no reason to spent megabucks on a short digital cable like this.Works great from my FIOS TV box to my Toshiba HDTV, recommended to all."
The Zune screen overlay is a great product. It fits the Zune's screen perfectly and once it's on you don't even know it's there. I highly recommend this product for any Zune owner who wants to protect its 3 screen."

I love this cable - it allows me to connect any USB device to my PC. Works with my Palm. I bought it for Treo 650 and it works great. A whole lot cheaper than what cellular stores want for these.
I bought this item to my brother. He said this charge set can charger the battery anywhere and will not miss out the wonderwork sight.
My rating is based on the fact that I have been using a Jetprinter Z55 printer for 2 years long. During this time I have used a variety of after market ink cartridges as well as self fill cartridges for printing photos or documents. None of these provided the print quality as this cartridge form Eforcity. As such, I would like to only buy ink cartridge form Eforcity.
This battery has been performing exactly as promised. I now have a spare battery for my camera to give me plenty of recording time. It accurately shows me the available battery charge and I have been getting all the time I need to record my children's constant activities.
Excellent product - works exactly the same as the Epson brand. I counted the pages and I got approximately the same number of pages. No clogups in fact, I believe I cleaned the heads less than I had to with the genuine replacement cartridge.
The sound is surprisingly good, if not quite hi fi, and the unit is small enough to throw in your luggage. You can use it to replace your tinny laptop speakers with the right cord. It doesn't work on batteries, though. My only real complain: you have to be a bit careful: the ipod can move on the connector, possibly damaging the dock and ipod.
Ordered this through Amazon from Eforcity"...got here very quickly for a VERY good price compared to a new one from Apple. Seems to work great so far, seems to be a very good quality adapter."
The device was easy to set up and install. Pc will recognize it right away and ready to go. I would highly recommend it!
Great quailty, well made and my iPod nano fits in it well. Sound is as good as can be expected considering the size of the speakers.
A great and economical replacement! This product saved me a lot of money. It worked with no problem.
Product in good condition.Shipping is very fast.And the price is much more cheaper than those in a store.
I really like this case. All the openings are cut perfectly, precisely outlining the screen, wheel, and connectors. It perfectly fits my ipod video. It's soft and comfortable to hold. I am happy with it.
This works great with my Sony Cybershot or may say it's even better than my original battery charger set. The battery holds longer charge then before. Till now, I have no problem with it. Good one!
The increased shooting time with this battery over the FP50 that came with my camcorder is considerable, am considering ordering another.
The sock is nice, it prevents me from making scratches to my iPod. It works so fine . I love it!
The case is great. And well priced! Highly recommend getting one of these..especially if don't have any protection plan on the iPod nano, and cant afford to break it. In short,Excellent Deal!
I find this product does the job. I probably could go the cheaper route but I like that it works and lasts quite awhile. I have found Amazon has the best price.
The ink is a perfect match with my Dell Photo All-in-One printer 966. I will buy again
As usual, on time delivery and product as expected. Well done Amazon!I will definately buy again.

A great price compared with other retailers. It works well with my Epson Stylus C67. Highly recommend this!
I bought this item form Eforcity. Fast Shipment!. This cable provide the high quality with my new HDTV. And the price of the cable is not expenscive.
Cables are well made from what appear to be great quality components. Fast shipping, great cables, who could ask for more!
It is with high quality and more than that, is at a great price.I use this to charge my ipod while driving. It is powerful enough to keep it well-charged throughout the trip.
I've been very happy with this Epson ink. I use my printer A LOT for a multitude of tasks including photo printing, color, and black printing in pictures and in text. I have used different types of paper, from ultra brite to photo, cardstock to regular old copy paper. The ink doesn't run, dries fast, it is bright and clear. The ink lasts a LONG TIME! I never have problems with clogging or blotching of ink or malfunctioning of the cartridges as I have had with generic inks. I must buy from this seller again.
The case perfectly fits my 80G models and the belt clip is a nice option and functions well. For the current price (even including shipping), this is a very good value compared to similar units you'll find at most retail outlets, therefore, I highly recommend this!
I boought this item for my friend. She likes it much as she can share her music with her boy friend.
This makes a nice, clean print and is reasonably priced. I've been able to print in high yields, so I'm happy.
The battery was purchased for my son's Zen, as a back-up. It works great. Amazon shipped everything quickly - I couldn't be more happy with their service
I received in great time and it was as if brought out of the store.Very basic but does the job.Thanks,
I am very very pleased with this product.The price was right and the shipping speedy. I would abosolutely make a future purchase!!!
It works great, The seller Eforcity shipped out the same day, Lightning fast shipping. Thanks arrived exactly as described. Repeat customer never dissapointed.
I found no problems with it... it arrived quickly and it works as great as my original. Worth it!
Great to see the movies on a bigger screen. After learning that Apple had simply switched the leads when they manufactured their own iPod AV cable." They did that to trick people into purchasing their own AV cables. At any rate, this AV cable is higher quality than iPod's, it 's retractable, and works with iPods.Good one."
This is the same cartridge I can purchase elsewhere, but cheaper. It works well in my printer with no issues whatsoever and my Canon printer prints fantastic photos when I use this ink cartridge and Canon premium photo paper.
I bought it for my Kodak DX6490. Battery is impressive. Seems like it holds a charge better than the original. Recommended highly!
I bought 2, one for me and one for my wife. both the screen protector and the case fits our ipods perfetly. Got the protection it needed.I found no problem with these, get it before buying more expensive!
This ink is great, it can print out high yields. It is a best ink cartridge for me to replace the original canon cartridge. I highly recommend this product.
Great service and a great price! The case works very well, my sansa player perfectly fits in it. thanks!
I bought this charger set for my friend as a bithday gift. She says this charger set is excellent for her to charger her battery anywhere, such as at home, traveling or on the road. It allows her catch up all greatful sight.
I really like this case. All the openings are cut perfectly, precisely outlining the screen, wheel, and connectors. It perfectly fits my ipod video. It's soft and comfortable to hold. I am happy with it.
The product is just what I wanted. As the iPAQ only comes with one I knew it would not be long before I needed an new one and sure enough....The product perfectly fits my pda, i like it!
I bought this cooler form Eforcity. I like this product for several reasons:- Lightweight. I carry it to work every day and while traveling.- Compact. Easy to carry whether on travel or not.- Great swivel feature. Great when sharing the screen with the person next to you.- Good for ergonomics. Without it, I find myself shifting my hands to an awkward position or I end up shifting the laptop. Now I just nudge it left or right.
My order arrived in excellent shape as well as the quickly shipping. The cable works great and is easy to use and keep. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
I bought this as an alternative to the more expensive Apple A/V cable, and it works absolutely perfect with my iPod. Both the sound and video quality are beautiful!
This battery is long-lasting! I own two of them for my digital camera the battery did very well with it!This battery seems to charge very fast too!I think it is well-worth buying 2 of them, but the battery lasts so long that you can easily get by with only one.
The case perfectly fits my ipod. Don't have to worry about the iPod video getting scratched or crushed. Great product with great price!
The color is great, it perfectly fits my player and it is cool~ the seller eforcity shipped out same day, speedy shipping, great price, thanks!
This SD card reader is perfect for what it does and for the price! I use a PDA and laptop constantly and interchangably. The PDA takes SD cards. I use my SD cards and this USB reader as a flash drive so that I have the same files for my PDA and laptop all on one drive. It's fast and simple, portable and very cheap. Highly recommended.
It has a higher capacity than the one that came with the printer and it yields good, clean printing.
This is just what I was looking for. This case fit my iPod Video 30GB perfectly, love the light weight of the case. I would highly recommend this.
The product is with high quality, it is as great as the origial Epson ink. Price is great and it works as I expected. Good one!
This adapter works ok. Make sure it works with your TV's color space first! Other than that, a decent product.
Wow these cables are great, for the price and come gold plated. They seem very durable also, with plenty of thickness and shielding.
This is the best case I have seen yet. I liked the idea of a clear case for my iPod. It is a very good design that leaves the top and bottom open for connections. I'm able to connect my radio transmitter while it's in the case, perfect for my car.
The charger works perfectly. I was really surprised at how fast it got to me. Since I love going places, this will be handy. The price is right and would recommend this highly!
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any USB device to my PC. Works with my Palm. I bought it for iPAQ rx3400 and it works great.
I was very suprise when the item arrival. It did not only come with a screen protector, but also lint-free cleaning cloth and squeegee card.
just received my armband for my iPod NANO. It is really lightweight, comfortable and easy to adjust.. Would buy again.
The sock is nice, keeps my thumbs warm. It's also great for bundling up those earbuds quickly and keeps me from scratching the case that keeps me from scratching my ipod.
Every olympus owner knows that sometimes with all the accessories the camera can become a bit off balance or jittery/difficult to control. The GS-2 is the solution.The GS-2 securely fastens between any two olympus brackets" (those slot things on the camera frame or accessory) that are about 4.5-5.0 inches apart. The buckle mechanism is very secure to hold onto your camera with the GS-2, even using one hand - but not recommendedThe inside (the part against your skin) is a velvet like texture while the outside (away from your skin) is a nylon fabric with a fastener for the grip adjustment. Each one (top and bottom) are secured separately.Because of the flexibility you can use the GS-2 with many cameras, accessories, and models so long as there is a 4.5-5.0 inch gap between the hook. You can also adjust the amount of space between your hand and the camera to make it tight or loose.It does seem a bit expensive at 30 bucks but considering the cost of dropping your camera, it's a deal. Left hand or right hand doesn't matter either.Overall I'm satisfied with mine because I can hold the camera more steady without a monopod or other gizmo. That's where the value comes in. The belt can be let out or pulled in as needed to cinch up the tension on the grip. It also has some generous padding inside it which makes using it comfortable. I find it useful under many situations holding the camera with just one hand.When you are out in the field without a tripod this gizmo is a life saver. It is lightweight, comfortable, and well engineered."
I use the rca to TR all the time on my mixer to go to powered speakers or do send/returns. This is just a basic stereo set at 6.5 feet that has no hum even though single ended (non differential).I really like hosa's build quality and heavy duty cables. Never a bit of hum even on the single end &lt;> differential mixer connections.I use a 25' version made by another company and they are just as good going to speakers, however these are laminated making for a convenient cable set.for the price and cable quality I've never gone wrong with hosa. Try a set - the price is right ahd the quiet sound. I'm really impressed.
I run alot of differential audio links with 1/4 or xlr inputs, so the ability to change from RCA consumer equipment to my mixer inputs is important. These cables are just the trick. The 1/4" plugs are heavily strain reliefed as are the RCA plugs. This allows me to connect my marantz PMD 661 recorder to my mixer MARANTZ PMD661 PMD-661 DIGITAL RECORDER. None of the handheld digital recorders use their xlr connections as outputs -- you don't get that feature until the luggable recorders or the rackmount recorders, so these cables are important.I also own a HOSA 3.5mm TRS to 1/4" dual plug stereo cable and have had great success with it.As for value - you can not build a stereo cable for this price with 4 connectors and 2x 9.9 ft of cable. I build alot of custom cables and the parts value alone is well worth it. I'm glad amazon teamed up with hosa for their product line."
I have probably close to a dozen hosa adapter cables by now - and they are top notch quality cable. These are just as good, it just happened that my only 1/4 TR to 1/4 TR male to male connectors were 25 feet long and mono (separated meant to make the run from the mixer to the amped speaker) - well I use speakon connectors for that anyways. I've been using the coiled up 25' lines too long to patch in a device on my mixer and finally broke down to buy a set of these. At 6.5 feet they are ideal for interconnecting 1/4 TR devices to my stereo inpus on the mixer. And being a dual cable they don't get tangled into a mess. Finally hosa's lable on the plugs for left/right keeps all in order instead of mixing up the same color black cables meant to head to speakers.I'm glad to have purchased this set - now I have a more complete pathcord kit for audio mixing. Hosa's quality stands head and anltlers above the rest.
At 13 feet long, you start to become concerned with 60hz (and 120, 180 hz 2nd and 3rd harmonic) pickup. Fortunately hosa uses a heavy gage cable with plenty of shielding.I've got a pretty good assortment of hosa, pyle, and monster cables and hosa always gives you the most for the money - 13 feet of 2 channel audio for $5+ship is a great deal, especially when the cable quality is well made.Hooked to my 20dB mic preamp input there was no noise on the line level channels on the mixing panels, so I can't fault the cable at all. I'm perfectly satisifed.
HOSA is making a real name for themselves in terms of quality low cost well made cable assemblies. This is every bit a professional quality patch cord. I bought it because I recently purchased a pair of amplified speakers from M-audio which feature professional 1/4 TRS inputs (differential) to cut hum and noise from the signal.The HOSA input is the quietest of all 3 inputs on the speaker system by 6dB. It sounds great, works great, and didn't set me back a fortune.I own several HOSA TRS/XLR adapters and have never had a problem with them. I would not expect one with this cable set given its construction quality and strain relief on all ends. Don't let the low cost fool ya - there's a good cable set here. And to the commenter who complained it's mono - it is 2 x mono - on any mixing panel that is how stereo inputs are achieved - one signal per channel. HOSA also makes 1/8 to 1/4 STEREO single plug cable sets, but you must look at the picture and read the description to ensure it is exactly the gender and size you want. I know the fustration of having the wrong cable adapter, hence I keep my build your own kit handy when what's in the cable box doesn't do it."
I work as an audio engineer so my cable kit must be able to match oddball connectors into mixing panels or recorders. The RCA plug is a very popular single ended interface (non-differential), and often must be connected to a differential input of a mixer or recorder.I've trusted HOSA's matching cables for home level equipment for many years now. They make a quality product that does not skimp on manufacturing anywhere. This adapter is no different.When going from single ended to differential you stand the potential of inserting noise into the signal if you use poor quality adapters. Fortunately with the HOSA cables and adapters this has never been a problem for me, which is why I prefer to buy that brand (I buy a couple of other cable brands as well, but HOSA is near the top of my list.)These stubby adapters take up very little space on the back of a mixing console or recorder. They are a high quality way to match signals on RCA cables from CD/DVD systems to digital recorders or mixers.
This is a great cable to have in your box. Everywhere we find the 3.5mm 1/8 stereo jack and interfacing it to XLR is always important. This is a stereo cable so the tip and ring go to the two different xlrs with a common shield to the cold terminal on the xlr. I'm using it to get analog audio from my pc's audio out jack into my XLR recorder (marantz pmd-661)Marantz PMD661 Portable SD Recorderwhich has a line level input on the xlr's. I can also adapt xlr mics to pc's mic in with xlr adapter cables.My PC motheboard has 6 3.5mm TRS jacks from the audio chip out the back, plus an optical connection, which is the order I made with this cable. I also got a 6' lightguide cable and a converter to RCA digital audio for my recorder which now gives me a number of options to link the two.I've come to trust HOSA cables and these are no let down."
My audio systems are mostly all XLR balanced audio inputs, and occasionally I have to connect to 1/8 TRS stereo outputs, for example my PC. This is the perfect cable because I get the left and right channels in XLR format with a single plug into the pc's audio card / motherboard.This cable went into immediate use as soon as it arrived and I will probably order another one because it is close to perfect and I have so many 1/8" stereo connections to make on modern pcs.This combination should be in every cable collection - you'll definitely use it."
These units are in the original condition the day these were first purchased. They have been tested and working out of the box, just plug and play. Drivers were loaded and modem and network drivers loaded!
I have an Epson stylus 880 printer and the price and the productivity with the Rhinotek brand fits me just fine.
I recently replaced my cartridges in my C64 with Rhinotek brand cartridges, and the only change that I have seen is that the cartridge lasts longer.
Rhinotek branded bci-6 cartridges were identical to the quality that were possesed by canon's bci-6 cartridges. I changed my printing preferences a little to get the right color scheme, and they printed superior to the canon in every way.
This cartridge is a fantastic substitute for the Epson brand cartridges, it performes as well as the Epson cartridges, and gives me a higher page count.
The money I saved was fantastic, and I cannot tell any difference in the quality of my printing.
The bci-6 series from Rhinotek which is compatable for the canon bci-6 cartridges worked in my printer better than the canon bci-6 that I was previously using. the quality was good without any changes by my part, after tweaking the printing properties for my printer and changing the way that the color printed, it became a fantastic cartridge set.
the Rhinotek brand is better in quality and performance than the canon brand. the ink last longer and my photos and documents look great.
I recently purchased the Rhontek cartridges RCE3011 for my Epson Stylus Color 900, and am very pleased. The quality and page count is amazing, even better is the ability to save a bunch of oney on the product as well.
I have a Epson Stylud C82, and these cartridges outlasted the Epson cartridges that I was using previously, and at a better price.
Better than epson cartridges! that is my opinion of the Rhinotek brand RCE9201, I have a Epson stylus photo 1280, and the quality is better than epson, and I gert more longevity out of the Rhinotek product.
I purchased a cartridge for home use through my office, the printing quality was as good as the HP brand I was using previously, and the cartridge lasted longer. I have purchased three more cartridges since, and will continously do so.
I saved money on these cartridges, and did not loose any quality, and they lasted longer, Go Rhinotek.
I print alot of photo's, and got tired of paying the highest prices for Epson cartridges, so i tried Rhinotek. I am quite impressed there is no difference in quality, the only difference is in the price.
