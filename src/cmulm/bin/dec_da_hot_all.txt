The LifeBook S6120 is very well-equipped for its price, and it's totally portable, with a travel weight of 4 pounds (with battery and optical drive). If you need 802.11g, you should opt for the S6120D trim, otherwise with the S6120 you get a very feature-rich and stylish computer for a totally good price. See my S6120D review for more details.
OK - having read ALL 7 reviews (thank you other 7 for opening my eyes) I decided to plunk down the dough and buy one. I wasn't able to understand why people were so diametrically opposed to this simple accessory - it was always either God's gift to cameras or useless as the day is long. It arrived today by UPS (thanks Amazon prime - next day service!)Here's what I can tell. I've been an Olympus user since the 2500 days - after the 2500 I graduated to the E20n - similar viewfinder - nice big image, easy to use. I avoided the E-1, content with my E20n and wondering what the 4/3 system would bring to revolutionize cameras or become another standard. Now I've moved to the Evolt 300 - and from day one, my biggest complaint has been The viewfinder is too small" - still having my E20n I compared them - sure enough the 300 is smaller than the E20n. What's going on here?I bought my AS-ME-1 and it clicked on easier than the rubber cup does. BAM suddenly my view was big again - like the E20n! I can see again. I can seeeee again! (little miami vice music here) And if you tweek the focus, it's a big deal.My personal theory (and I am wrong as well as right) is that it depends if you use prescription glasses. Or maybe other prescriptions. The eye has an entrance pupil. The AS-ME-1 guides the light from the focus grid THROUGH that pupil. I personally like to shoot with my glasses on. Camera up, halfway push, fully push if happy, camera down. My friends remove their glasses, in their mouth they go, and up to the eye goes the rubber cup - and they shoot and shoot and shoot. They don't seem to be bothered by the E300.IF you are nearsighted your glasses make things look smaller than they actually are (ask old ben franklin who invented eyeglasses) - the AS-ME-1 counters this effect of prescription lenses. If you remove your glasses or have 20/20 vision, well, you may like a bigger image, but it's not likely to be as big of a deal as it was for me.I'm happy - 5 stars and all that - it's a winner. I FULLY respect the people who have given it one star. They made me search for a reason. I think the eyeball & vision & glasses are the key to this product being a benefit or hindrance to the shooter. Yes, its 20% larger (1/5) - for me that's a big deal.Given the price to potential performance ratio, it's a winner for a good chunk of the population who doesn't remove their eyeglasses to snap a picture Those with 20/20 and shoot at nightime or a dimly lit studio will have a large entrance pupil and likely not benefit.Human sensory perception has a threshold of noticability of about 10% meaning if one cup of water is 10% hotter than another it will be felt as hotter, but less than 10% and it's likely to feel the same temperature, same goes for shades of grey, and almost any perception. It's called the 10% rule. At 20% increase in picture size, the AS-ME-1 is pretty much guaranteed to be noticed by the human physiology, and that was the final reason I bought it. Lets hope your experiences are good ones - I didn't say you'd like it - just notice it! (the optics however are top notch)"
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk SDMSPD-256-A10 256MB MemoryStick Pro Duo, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Digital audio can be optical or rca (single) TTL digital. The critical factor in buying a converter is to purchase the proper direction - this one goes FROM optical TO RCA coaxial cable. They also make the other version RCA to optical - but understand each side only will go one direction.Knowing this I bought the cheapest, well known (I've used cables to go before) system that was well reviewed and it worked perfectly. I added $2.20 for the 6 foot optical cable (see my reviews for it) and now my new pc which only had optical out has a coax RCA out as well.TESTING:I ran this up to 192 khz, 24 bit, 2 channel audio into my marantz pmd-661 digital input (rca) - no problems and the recordings sound fine.IT Works! can't beat the price. My only pet peeve is it uses 6V to run and could be powered by a usb port, but to get good TTL output from USB's weak specifications is not likely, so I'm not complaining. It needs the 6V which it wont get from USB.

These slim jewel cases in a clamshell" shape by Maxell provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them.Moreover, these slender jewel cases provide excellent storage for media and they measure less than half the width of the older, original jewel cases that seem far too wide and "fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too. These jewel cases can be storing discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or whatever.These colorless plastic cases keep each disc firmly in place inside the plastic case. That's a great added feature--and you can also see the disc being stored without having to open the jewel case.However, there's one drawback that I absolutely hate--these cases are difficult to store in rows along a shelf of my cabinet. The clamshell base is too small for the media holder to stay straight up for long periods of time; and they inevitably wind up slipping and sliding about on the shelf when I want to find something on the cabinet shelf. This irks me and I will take off one and one-half stars for this problem.I still think that these CD/DVD jewel cases provide compact yet sturdy storage for media. Be careful how you store them on shelves, however, or else they'll get loose and fall everywhere when you try to find something on a shelf where they've been stored.Three and one-half stars."
The most amazing thing about the Shuffle, bar none, is its weight. Actually, it's weightlessness. You don't know that you are wearing it. If you pick it up, it feels like a piece of plastic holding air. At .78 ounces, that's the equivalent of 20 small paper clips.The first time I held one in my hand, I knew I had to have one. Never thought I could convince my wife to spend three H's on a big iPod, and with a cell phone and a PDA already, didn't need another weighty device hanging off of me.Enter Shuffle.I've had it for the past few weeks. The lack of a screen is a small minus. Sometimes it would be nice to know what's coming next, or find a particular track. But it's easy enough to skip if you hit one you don't want to hear -- which is rare, because after all, it's your music.Sound quality is fine. Battery life is OK, too, about 10-15 hours.Now, for the quibbles. Charging the Shuffle is a pain. You have to have it plugged into a USB port. I don't know about your desktop, but mine is on the floor, and it's a pain to plug and unplug. It's no problem on the laptop. Also, it takes 4 hours to fully charge. That's weak compared to the competish. (It's like, who cares that you have USB 2.0? You could USB 0.000001 and still transfer the songs in 4 hours.) There should be a quick charge option, an adapter, or something similar. You can get a docking station, but that defeats the $99 price point. Sony's offering a similar enough player with 70 hours (!), although it's a bit heavier and doesn't work with iTunes.Transferring songs is also a pain. There are hacks using the Shuffle in disk mode -- others here or on iPod web sites can tell you how to do it -- but directly uploading songs from Shuffle to computer is made difficult as a bar (albeit a low one) to piracy. I'm sure Apple is trying to keep the record labels happy, but it should be easier.Anyway, the last few weeks I've rediscovered my music collection -- another plus of the Shuffle. Although you can set up playlists, I prefer random. I've listened to great tunes I forgot I had. Old Santana, Marley, Zeppelin and U2 mixed with a little Green Day turns my grocery shopping into a groovy concert. And I've had probably 20 people ask me what's hanging around my neck. (19 positive, 1 jerk who joked that it looked like an alarm for elderly people for when they fall and can't get up).Final thought -- get the 512, not the 1 Gig. There is no point having more music (16 hours) than battery life (12 hours) without a screen. 120 songs is just fine 99 percent of the time.
The iBook G4 line has been incredibly successful, for Apple. Why? It combines a beautiful and sleek form factor, while at the same time being a machine capable of getting your tasks completed.Improvements - What were the improvements in the July 2005 update to iBook?Faster Processor - The G4 chip was increased in the 14-inch model, from 1.33 GHZ to 1.42GHZ. Big improvement? No, but it is good to always improve performance. The system bus speed in the 14-inch iBook was also increased, from 133MHZ to 142MHZ.More memory - The memory in the iBook has been doubled, with a now standard 512 MB DDR SDRAM, which speeds up your entire experience on the iBook, particularly, when multi-tasking. The iBook also has an open user-accessible slot, where you can add 256 MB, 512 MB, or an entire gigabyte of DDR SDRAM. However, the now standard 512 MB, allows the majority of users to fully appreciate the iBook out of the box.Store More Stuff - The hard drive has been increased to 60 GB, from the 40 GB that was previously standard on the 14-inch. This is important, for people are constantly putting more music, photos, and applications on their systems. This hard drive will hold thousands of songs and photos, but video takes up space fast, so be careful with that.Even More Wireless - Airport Extreme, for wireless networking, continues to be standard, but Apple has also made bluetooth technology standard, with this iBook. Bluetooth allows you to use wireless bluetooth mice, keyboards, mobile phones, etc. It is a great technology and helps to clean-up your desktop by doing away with some of the cords.Core Image Compatible - The new IBook G4's video card is an ATI Mobility Radeon 9550, which is core-image compatible. This allows you to take advantage of Mac OS X Tiger's core-image technology, including the well-known droplet" effect, when you open a widget.The great iBook features that continue to shine: A buyer of the iBook will continue to enjoy Mac OS X Tiger, which is the best consumer operating system in the world. It works seamlessly with the hardware to provide a simple, fast, elegant, and reliable experience. One of the favorite descriptions of Mac fans, to describe Macs, is simply, "it just works."The iBook continues to include iLife '05, with great applications such as iPhoto, iMovie HD, iDVD, iTunes, and Garageband. These are all included, with every iBook G4. You will be challenged to find any PC notebook that includes applications that come anywhere close to the iLife suite. Manage thousands of your digital images in iPhoto, create home movies in iMovie, and create professional music in Garageband.Appleworks is included for simply word processing, spreadsheets, etc., but you might want to pick up Microsoft Office for Mac. A student/teacher edition is available, for just over $100.Superdrive - The Apple SuperDrive allows you to burn music and data CDs, plus you can burn your own DVDs! Edit home videos in iMovie, put together a beautiful DVD menu to access those home movies in iDVD, and then burn it all to DVD! Furthermore, you can use your Superdrive to back-up important data to DVD.Form Factor - The iBook's strong, white casing is rugged. It is, unfortunately, prone to scratching, so be careful. However, the iBook is strong, and there are many stories of it taking a beating, but kept on performing.Drawbacks? The 14-inch iBook G4 has a drawback when it comes to video output options. The 14-inch iBook only supports mirroring to an external display, and you cannot close the iBook, while connected to an external display, or it goes to sleep. Furthermore, the iBook splits the video memory between an external display and its on built-in LCD, no matter what you do. The external display is also limited to 1024x768, since it mirrors the iBook's own display. What does this mean? If you want a notebook that works beautifully with a big external display, when you're back at your desk, then you probably do not want an iBook. However, if you're going to use the iBook as its intended, as a notebook computer, it is a fantastic choice.Furthermore, the 14.1" display runs at a resolution of only 1024x768. This is not a particularly high resolution. In fact, it is the same resolution as the 12-inch iBook. This means you will not fit anything more onto 14-inch iBook display than you would the 12-inch display. The 14-inch display simply makes things look bigger, which is an advantage, if you have a difficult time seeing things up-close.Overall, the July 2005 update to the iBook G4 has made Apple's consumer notebook even more competitive in the market. It is faster, has more memory, a bigger hard drive, and bluetooth technology built-in. Furthermore, you'll continue to enjoy Mac OS X Tiger, iLife '05, and the other great Macintosh applications. The 14-inch iBook does not offer any more screen real estate than the 12-inch model, but things will appear larger, for those with poor eyesight. Of course, a larger size and slight increase in weight are consequences of the larger screen, but you are also rewarded with a standard superdrive for burning DVDs, which is not even an option on the 12-inch iBook. The new iBook G4 is a brilliant machine, and it is sure to find its way onto many desks in the coming months."
Kodak makes a great disposable camera with their Kodak Max HQ 35mm single use camera. The camera takes some pretty good photos considering it's a single use camera. Indeed, many of the pictures I've taken using this camera come out almost as well as they would have if I had used a more expensive, conventional 35mm camera instead.Don't open the box and unwrap the camera from its foil paper wrapping until you're ready to use it; and make sure you use this camera before the expiration date printed on the cardboard box. When you do want to use the camera it's simple enough to use. Wind it up for the first photo you take by running your thumb on the dial on the top of the camera from left to right. Want a flash for your picture? No problem. Just push the flash button on the front of the camera and within seconds the camera can take a flash picture. There's also an indicator on the top of the camera to tell you how many pictures you have left on the roll of film inside it.The 800 film helps make this camera very useful for both outdoor and indoor photos; and it's easy to carry this camera because it's so light and compact. It can fit into a woman's pocketbook, a man's briefcase, backpack or just about any overnight travel bag.You also get 39 exposures per camera; this makes the camera great for vacations or extensive photo taking days like weddings and other ceremonies. Great!Unfortunately, there is one fly in the ointment. Although this camera is really very good; the pictures it takes are not quite as clear and crisp as they would be from a digital camera or a conventional 35mm camera with the individual rolls of film you put in and then take out when you're ready to have the film developed. I hope that Kodak remedies this problem quickly; but until then I have to take off a star for this to make this a four star review.Overall, this single use camera is convenient and budget priced. After all, digital cameras and regular 35mm cameras can get somewhat expensive; this is your best choice if you're on a budget and want a Kodak quality camera. It doesn't yet have the technology to take the very best quality pictures so I hope Kodak works on this in the near future.Four stars!
I bought this to use with the Xantrex Pro Sine inverterXantrex Technologies Prosine 1000 Prosine 1,000 to 1,500-Watt Power Inverterbecause behind the 4 screws on the front control/lcd display panel there exists a simple modular plug to extend the panel 25 feet from the inverter. I never even ran phone traffic over the cord! but it worked great for extending the circuit between the control panel and the inverter - the LCD still shows the data display, and the on/off switch still works normally even with the inverter 25 feet from its normally built in controller. For the price, I could not be happier - it came fast and solved a complex problem with very little money spent.Alot of things use modular jacks in audio, telephone, key systems, etc. Just be sure the number of wires matches (there are 3 versions of this plug - the 2 wire-uncommon, the 4 wire-common inc this one, and the 6 wire-uncommon but used in alarm systems quite a bit.When remodeling a modular extension may allow you to move your alarm keypad to the other side of a new door or have some other feature panel that uses a 4 wire modular plug moved.BEWARE some extensions reverse the wires - e.g. the rightmost wire on the plug is now the leftmost on the jack - while this will work with phones, it wont work on gear meant to use straight through wired plug/jack extensions. I.e. using an ohm meter you should see the leftmost contact on the plug makes a nearly 0 ohm connection with the leftmost contact on the jack, and not to any other wires in the jack.Great accessory for phones too!
It is a question that all digital camera enthusiasts ask themselves shortly after purchasing a digital camera, but it is one that is not easily answered as there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. This review will help to guide you to the best solution based off the characteristics and specifications of the Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera. I feel I am qualified to provide this information as I was in the memory industry for 7 years but having left the industry a year ago, I can be completely unbiased on this subject.One of the biggest factors to consider is the megapixel rating of this Toshiba camera. Considering this particular camera is generally considered to be a 4MP digital camera. You can expect to store approximately 32 images on a 64MB card, 64 pictures on a 128MB flash card, 128 digital pictures on digital film of 256MB capacity, 256 pics on a 512MB picture card, 512 images on a 1GB media card, 1,024 photos on a 2GB flash card, and a monstrous 2,048 digital photos on a 4GB card. These image/picture calculations assume that you are going to utilize the full potential of your camera but won't shoot in RAW mode. In other words, the estimates are for shooting at the highest JPEG setting available for the Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera. Understand that they are indeed estimates and can vary based off the actual scene or subject being shot and the amount of light, color variation, detail, etc. in the photo. You can assume these numbers are accurate within 10%.However how many images a card can hold is not the only factor you should consider before buying this all important accessory. You should also consider that you may want to use your Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera to take shots of sporting events, wildlife, or even your child's unique expressions. These moments have a very small window of opportunity to get the shot you desire thus a flash card that has been rated by experts as being a faster card may be something to consider. In my opinion, it is always best to find a review of a flash card as it performed in your specific digital camera. Some cameras just work better with specific flash cards do to the software, firmware, buffer utilization, etc. between the camera and the flash card. Finding an answer to this question is not usually an easy task. There is, though, a superb website that not only offers flash card reviews but also has an extensive user forum that can answer this all important question for you. You may want to take a look at dpreview dot com and then do a search for the Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera in the forums area, if that doesn't work just do a search on Toshiba and you should be able to find someone that can help you. I am fairly certain you will have plenty of information to make an informed buying decision. You may also want to look at their detailed review of this particular camera as well if you have not yet decide on whether to purchase it.Of course one of the next factors to consider is in regards to price. Please, do not make the mistake that I have made of buying the absolute cheapest flash card. Take a look at the factors I have mentioned here before you make a purchase. Think of a flash card for your Toshiba camera as an extension to it. Just as you wouldn't purchase the cheapest camera case for your camera (personally I own the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack but I like the extra room and the backpack style, which may not be your cup of tea) don't necessarily purchase the cheapest flash card either. Keep in mind that you will use this card every single time you use your camera. Like I said it is truly an extension of your digital camera.The final thing I will mention is in regards to service. There are a number of flash card suppliers in the world today. However all of the flash cards are actually built by a handful (3 - 5) of companies and even those companies only have a few options (2 - 4) regarding which components they are going to use in their particular design. More or less, the actually hardware inside each flash card is going to be similar but the way in which they utilize that hardware and the level of support they will provide, given there is a problem, are more paramount. Just imagine going 10 days without a flash card for your camera (which I did) because you are waiting for some company to repair your flash card, or worse yet having it fail and having no recourse. There are a couple of manufacturers that do very well in regards to utilizing technology and providing customer service. As of the time of this writing they are SanDisk, Lexar, and Viking. However check the newsgroups and forums for the latest information as it can be very cyclical and unfortunately can take a turn for the worse overnight.No matter what flash card you decide to use with your digital camera make sure you take the time to take the pictures. Time flies by fast and having thousands of images to thumb through 5 years from now to remind you of the time that has gone by will be the most powerful investment of all. I have personally purchased a SimpleTech external hard drive to store my images on (another reason I like the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack as it gives me room to put in my hard drive). The hard drive combined with the backpack allows me to take my photos with me when I go visit family and friends. I use PhotoShop exclusively to do all my photo editing and batch processing (a great feature of PhotoShop) and of course make occasional backups to DVD-RW.Enjoy your Toshiba PDR-M81 4MP Digital Camera. I hope this review has informed you how this camera can be best enhanced by a flash card and the best approach in finding one that meets your specific needs.
If you didn't know already from my previous reviews, I've been having troubkle finding suitable haeadphones for my iPod for the past two weeks. First the Philips SBC3200, which sounded good but the fit was terrible. Then the Panasonic RHPS34, which had good sound and fit well but leaked too much sound. Then I was given a free set of Koss P3 earbuds, which is a good set, but of course keep falling out during active use since they don't have a hook. I spotted these on Amazon and thought they were a good deal. They were on sale for under ten bucks, and judging by the features and JVC brand name they seemed like a great value. Yep.I didn't quite expect good sound out of these. They were only ten bucks and I'd think since they come with all these extra features that they'd put in cheap quality earbuds inside. Not a chance. These completely blow away the Sony MDRE828LP, the Koss P3, and the Sony MDRJ10, and practically any other earbud headphone out there at this price that I've tried. I plugged these into my stereo and thought they sounded good but when I put these on my iPod or my CD player with bass boost, these sound excellent for the price. The bass is very solid on these. Although they don't provide a strong 'boom', they do have great bass otherwise. The mids are great, and these provide a very clear, detailed sound. If you're looking for great sound while working out or you just want a good home set, these are it.In other aspects, these are very comfortable, even if the hooks are plastic. The earbuds are actually moveable", so you can easily adjust it to fit your ear. The cord is asymmetrical, so if someone is speaking to you the earbud won't fall all the way and instead will rest on your shoulder. If you don't like it, see my review for the Panasonic clip headphones. For other features, as shown in the picture, these come with a volume control. It's only at stomach level so you can easily change the headphone's volume. It doesn't go completely mute or go all the way to the player's full volume, but it does go from very loud so soft. The cord is also a long five feet which gives you plenty of room from your portable player and you won't feel like you're on a chain to your pocket. These also have an L plug so the sound won't cut out if you bang it a little.There are many versions of this JVC clip headphone. One is black, this one is blue. There is also a version without the volume control (come in both two colors mentioned).Amazon lists these at fourteen bucks (unless they're on sale). For that price these aren't a bad deal, actually a great one; you are going to get a pair of clip headphones that will last a good six months, sound great, are comfortable, and have a little volume control.Overall, these were a good investment and I'm glad I chose them over some others. These have really good sound and are comfortable to wear, and for the price they can't really be beat. They might feel weird to those new to this style of headphones but they really are one of the best pairs out there. 5 stars."
The QuickCam Messenger is one little webcam that is totally affordable and works great. The resolution is 640x480, although the native resolution captured by the chip seems lower as at the maximum image quality is not what you'd expect from a true VGA digital camera. But that's ok. I usually run the QuickCam at a lower resolution, to improve framerate over my DSL connection. What's cool about this model is it has a built-in microphone, so you don't need to fumble with an external mic if your PC doesn't already have one built-in. (Tip: wear headset to avoid audio feedback into the mic, which will confuse the heck out of your chat companion!)The webcam captures decent colors. The key is to have good ambient lighting: place a light behind the camera, not behind yourself! Also don't use a strong light source; something soft works best. The camera provides auto-white balance as well as auto exposure. Focus, however, is not automatic, so you need to manually turn the focus ring to get the sharpest picture of yourself. You can also snap still images of yourself, if that's what you are into.If you run Windows XP, you don't need to install any driver. Just plug in the QuickCam Messenger, and fire up the latest version of MSN Messenger (version 6), which was compiled to work great with Logitech webcams, thanks to some marketing agreement between Microsoft and Logitech. You can also use Yahoo Messenger, but the new MSN Messenger has better video chat than Yahoo's offering. For AOL's instant messenging program, you'll need to install a utility on the companion CD-ROM. I haven't tried it since I don't use AIM, so can't comment on its quality.For other flavors of Windows -- Win 2000, ME or 98 -- install the companion software first before you plug in the QuickCam Messenger. The installer will tell you went to plug the webcam into the USB port.In short, this webcam gives decent image quality (esp. considering the price, before or after rebate) and has the nice touch of a built-in mic. The downside is no auto focus and so-so image quality.Note: There's no support for Macintosh. If you use a Mac, get a Windows XP PC, or you can probably use Virtual PC 6 to make it work.
The Fuji Finepix A205 is a very nice digital camera for those not ready to purchase a more advanced model yet. It's a nice and very affordable way to get started in digital photography. It takes generally pleasant pictures both indoors and out, and it's very easy to use. The build quality is also very good.If you are looking for a &quot;serious&quot; digital camera, however, go for one with at least 3MP, preferably 4MP. (But 5MP or more might be an overkill.) 2MP resolution gives you decent 4x6&quot; prints, but if you start cropping a little, you'll wish you had more pixels to work with.
The new Nikon D70s digital SLR camera is a slight upgrade to the successful and popular D70 model. It retains the size and body construction of the D70, and also keeps all the features of the D70 that make the latter such a prized digital SLR, e.g.: same CCD sensor and DSP chip; instantaneous start-up; fast response, little shutter lag; industry-leading 1/500 flash sync (wow!); 3D color matrix metering; and the powerful i-TTL flash/lighting system. Like the D70, the D70s uses a CompactFlash memory card and is MicroDrive-compatible.The D70s differs from the D70 in the following aspects:- port for electronic cable release (MC-DC1)- larger, 2.0 LCD (vs. D70's 1.8", but same resolution)- slightly more powerful batteryTo many Nikon diehard's disappointment, the D70s did not include more megapixels (unlike the Canon DR XT vs. DR) or a more powerful AF system, and kept D70's slow-poke USB 1.1 (a.k.a. "USB 2.0 full-speed") connection.Since the D70s is just a minor upgrade, I strongly believe the D70 to be a much better value. You should go with the D70s only if you absolutely need the cable release feature."
These slim jewel cases by Memorex provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. Could that be because I'm a 90 pound weakling? SMILE Well, I doubt it--I think these are well constructed. They hold together for years at a time and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases provide excellent storage for media and they measure roughly less than half the width of the older, original jewel cases that seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too. These jewel cases can be storing discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or whatever.They provide you with colorless plastic cases and a slightly frosted bottom for the case. The center hub keeps each disc firmly in place inside the plastic case, too. That's a great added feature--and you can also see the disc being stored without having to open the jewel case. They certainly aren't ugly!Overall, I highly recommend this CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. Use these in good health!SMILE"
There is nothing wrong with this iPod Shuffle. However, as time has worn on, it's simply less exciting.It wasn't actually updated on the September 2008 update, but some additional colors were added including this sharp blue.Overall, the Shuffle still works great. You sync some of your favorite music to it, and then listen in order, or choose to shuffle it. I must admit that mine sits on my desk and isn't used very often, but it's still nice to have, for its amazingly small size and light weight. Some like having an extra small device for traveling, but I find the Nano and Touch to be perfectly small enough, and the Nano starts at 149.If you're really trying to save some money, and you just want to get some music out of iTunes onto a device, this will do it for you at a really great value. No problems. Also, perhaps you want it as a second iPod, another fine option. However, if you are getting your first iPod, and you do not mind the cost of an entry-level Nano, you'll enjoy being able to find your music on the display.The Shuffle has its place and gets the job done, but it's just not as exciting as the other iPods, nor is always having your playlist blind," always convenient."
These stickers should be placed in the corner of your windows or someplace similar where a potential burglar can easily see them. I know; you may not actually have an alarm system installed in your home. Nevertheless, these stickers go a long way when it comes to discouraging intruders. My father has similar stickers in the windows of his home and he's never been robbed nor victimized.Before you apply the stickers to the window, try placing them in different places of the window while the adhesive backing is still on the sticker. This way you get an idea of what the sticker will look like once you apply it. You may also want to ask a family member or a friend you trust to stand outside the window and discreetly tell you where the sticker will look most effective from the outside. Once you find the right place for your stickers make a very light mark on the window with a light colored pencil. This way the marks on the window can be erased easily after the sticker is on or just before you apply the sticker.Of course there's never any guarantee that these stickers alone will ward off all potential intruders. However, for those of us who cannot afford or do not want an alarm system, these stickers do a great job. They look very official, too.Highly recommended!
(Note: Tamron also makes this lens available for Nikon and Pentax digital SLRs, for the same price. In fact I have the Nikon version since I own a D70, but I thought my experience with this lens could help Canon d-SLR users as well. Please don't flame me!)This new digital SLR-friendly zoom lens from Tamron is a great way to acquire a high-quality zoom lens for a fraction of the cost if you bought from the camera maker (e.g., Canon). Tamron claims this is world's smallest and lightest" zoom lens for the focal range. I have no idea if that's true. It's small and lightweight indeed. To my eyes it's an all-plastic lens, but this made-in-Japan lens looks and feels solid. It has all the bells and whistles of a modern lens: XR, LD, asperical, plus macro capability. In real world shooting I'm very happy with the result, and I really don't think buying an official Canon lens would make much of a difference. Two things to keep in mind is, 1) as long as you buy a namebrand lens (Tamron, Sigma, and maybe Vivitar) you are getting a good deal, and 2) the marginal increase in lens quality (perceived or real) from the camera maker is extremely unlikely to improve pictures by any discernible amount. Give Ansel Adams a disposable camera and he would still take better pics than you and me, period. As long as you have a high quality, capable lens like this Tamron, you are armed with all the gear you need to NOT miss a great picture opportunity. The only ingredient nobody can sell, is your creativity. (Unfortunately the latter is what I lack and try to improve. For now, at least the Tamron is giving me the right tool.)For the Digital Rebel, the 1.6 "magnification" factor (or crop factor) means the effective focal length of this Tamron is about 45-480mm in 35mm equivalent. Whoa!In short, this is a really top-quality lens that any Digital Rebel enthusiast should consider. It's a lot bang for the buck, and it's even made in Japan unlike many Canon official lenses which are made in sweatshops in Southeast Asia."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Fujifilm 64MB XD Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
This is the latest version of the device that has been in use since the mid-1990s. It allows both storage and transfer and works on any bi-directional or EPP parallel port. For best results, you should run the Parallel Port Accelerator" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like with a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device. Most printers will operate from the printer port on the back.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn't work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first ("daisy chaining"). This changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CD-roms. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). Both units have been proven useful over time. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as it works for you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different Windows systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.The one problem with my used drive is the inkjet printer with an IEEE 1284 cable will not print as well when attached to this unit."
I print alot of photo's, and got tired of paying the highest prices for Epson cartridges, so i tried Rhinotek. I am quite impressed there is no difference in quality, the only difference is in the price.
If you are like me and have tons of old 8mm (or Hi8) tapes lying around, this 8mm Walkman is perfect. I upgraded to MiniDV but forgot to transfer my old 8mm tapes before giving my Canon 8mm camcorder away, so with this I'm not stuck with useless tapes. It plays back regular 8mm, Hi8, and also Sony's Digital8 formats. You can hook it up to a VCR or TV, and even to a DV-savvy PC. I capture my 8mm videos to my Fujitsu LifeBook C2210 laptop, using Windows Movie Maker 2 (download for free on Microsoft's website). I'm now about 40% done with transfering my old tapes, but I also enjoy hooking this up to my TV and playing back old tapes and re-living old memories. Ah, how time just flies...
Up till now I've been a big fan of Canon digital cameras (esp. the PowerShot S410 and S500), but also have liked Minolta and Pentax offerings. Last night I went to a wedding and the gentleman sitting next to me had the Nikon Coolpix 3200, and I was astonished to discover how excellent its battery life was. The gentleman took over 300 shots, all with flash on and all with LCD on as viewfinder, and he also played back the pictures to lots of guests, and at the end, when we were among the last to leave, the batteries in the camera were still going strong! I was totally impressed. I had my Minolta Dimage F300 (5MP camera) with me and the batteries ran out after about 80 shots -- and my NiMH was rated higher than his (2100mAh vs. his 1950, I believe). I walked away totally sold on the Nikon.OK, I exaggerated. If the image quality weren't good, perpetual battery life wouldn't have meant much. But judging from zoomed-in playback on the Nikon's LCD, as well as his comments, the image quality seemed excellent. Compared to my Minolta Dimage F300, the 3200's images were generally sharper, while the color temperature was not as pleasing as my Minolta's, but still excellent. He took a wide range of shots, from outdoors to indoors to close-ups to wide-angle... and most came out quite satisfying from a technical point of view. All were well-exposed, sharp, and evenly lit in cases where flash was used.In addition, I noticed that when I borrowed his 3200 to shoot a few pictures after my Minolta's batteries died, the recycle time on the 3200 was quite fast, unlike my Minolta, which could take 6 or 7 seconds before I could shoot the next shot. The 3200 was ready in under a second. The only problem I experienced was there seemed to be a shutter delay with the 3200: after I pressed the shutter, it waited a second or slightly longer before taking the picture. You may want to keep this in mind when shopping for this camear. The delay didn't affect the pictures, but did feel weird since my Minolta has virtually no shutter delay.The camera seemed well built. But it was the battery life that was truly impressive -- and the fact it delivered such good battery performance on 2 AA NiMH batteries!
US Robotics ISA Modem 0460This 56K internal hardware modem can fit into an 8-bit ISA slot. It uses jumpers to set the COM port and the IRQ number. A chart on the back of the card shows the jumper setting for COM 1, 2, 3, or 4. You can select the IRQ number (2, 3, 4, 5, or 7). This provides the most flexibility for computers. But if you remove all the COM jumpers it will become a PNP (Plug and Play) modem. This is a Data / Fax modem. It connects over telephone lines to converse with another computer. The Fax capability allows it to send and receive facsimile messages without a separate dedicated fax machine. But a fax machine is better with a dedicated telephone line as it won't interfere with voice communications at the same time. It is easier to use for the average person.Internal modems are inserted into the appropriate slot after the power is off and the cover removed. When the Windows operating system starts it will recognize the added hardware. You can either let Windows search for the driver software, or direct it to the floppy drive or folder on your hard drive. The driver (mdm3com) for this 56K FAX INT" modem fits on a floppy disk. You will need added software to support sending and receiving faxes on your computer. Some software will handle pages that have been read into the computer via a scanner.This modem can handle the top speed of local telephone lines. If you are further than 3 to 5 miles from the telephone switching station the top speed will probably be lower. Static on the lines can affect transmission speeds. The long wires act as aerials to pick up radio transmissions or electromagnetic disturbances. You may also notice a drop in speed during heavy rains. Thunder and lightning can affect the lines."
As usual, on time delivery and product as expected. Well done Amazon!I will definately buy again.
The update to the 15-inch MacBook Pro in February 2011 was significant. Indeed, significant is an understatement. Quick thanks to Amazon and Apple Stores for having these immediately available at launch.The primary upgrade to this revision? The processor! Intel has a brand new architecture called Sandy Bridge, and these MacBook Pros are the first Macs to feature this technology. Some have called it some of the most significant changes to Intel architecture since Pentium 4 was introduced. These 15-inch MacBook Pros as well as its big brother, the 17-inch, not only take advantage of Sandy Bridge, but the Quad Core i7 Variant. Quad Core processor in a notebook Mac! Wow.I actually chose the 13-inch model for my personal use (only Dual Core on the 13-inch), but this 15-inch is replacing an aging iMac at the office to save space and leap over its performance. These Quad Core Chips are amazing. Early benchmarks are showing this entry-level 15-inch, 50 percent faster than the upper end i7 15-inch MacBook pro from a year ago. A dramatic improvement. Furthermore, if you're still on a Core 2 Duo machine such as the iMac I am replacing, the performance is as much as 2.5 times faster. At least in terms of the processor. This is most beneficial in processor intensive applications, for consumers such applications are iMovie and Garageband. Professionals will see the new processors beneficial in any professional photo editing, video, or music work.One downside is that due to cost, the machine still comes with a spinning hard drive standard. In this case, the standard drive is a 5400 RPM 500 GB drive. That offers plenty of storage, but is slightly slower than a desktop 7200RPM drive and much slower than a new, solid state drive. You do have options. You can special order the machine from Apple with a 7200RPM drive, or Solid State Drive. However, what I have decided to do, is simply, when I'm ready, swap out the drive myself. Other World Computing sells solid state drives compatible. It might not be easy for every user, but for those with some computer experience, it is a fairly easy swap. Then I can install a faster solid state drive, when the more acceptable capacity drives come down a bit in price. You might also choose to do the swap yourself because you can then put the hard drive that was originally in the machine, into an external enclosure, and use it as an external drive for backup. Of course, any damage you cause to the machine would not be covered under warranty. Therefore, if you have any concern, you might want to see if you can special order from Apple online, or in many situations, you will find the standard hard drive to be acceptable.After the processor advancement, Thunderbolt is the other great new technology included in this revision to the MacBook Pro. Thunderbolt looks like the Mini Displayport that was already included on the MacBook Pros. Indeed, it will still function perfectly as a Mini Displayport, for connecting an external display. However, Thunderbolt is more importantly a new interface to connect external devices in the future, such as, external hard drives, HD camcorders, and perhaps even iPads, iPods, or iPhones someday. Data would then transfer many times faster to and from these devices than it does currently. These devices were not available at the time of the MacBook Pro's launch, but we have already heard that external drives should be available later this year with Thunderbolt connectivity.iSight camera has been upgraded to HD resolution and Face Time pre-installed on the computer. This gives you the ability to video chat, easily, with other Macs and notably, iPhone 4s and the newest iPod Touch with front facing camera.The consumer software you expect to be included by Apple is once again here. The latest version of Mac OS X Snow Leopard (operating system), iLIfe 11 including iPhoto, Garageband, iMovie, iDVD, and iWeb is all here. OS X always includes Safari web browser, iTunes, and Mail applications too. The average user would be good to go out of the box. You might pick up Microsoft Office for your office document needs, or simply purchase Apple's iWork applications (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote) from new Mac App Store on your computer.The new MacBooK Pros, thanks to Sandy Bridge technology are fast. They will save you time, when using processor intensive applications. Time in business, saves people money and frustration. The average consumer might see less gains with this update as physically the MacBook Pro has retained it identical appearance, size, and weight. Nevertheless, under the unibody, improvements have certainly occurred which result in a much faster notebook. The fact that these 15-inch and 17-inch models now include Quad Core Processors standard is really extraordinary. This is putting recent top of the line desktop performance, into a sleek and attractive Mac Notebook. A breakthrough. Recommended Product!
The Fujitsu N5010 laptop computer is on the heavy side, as it's designed as a desktop replacement. In terms of specs and real-world performance, it shines and outperforms many similarly-equipped desktops. The 16&quot; screen is gorgeous, and like with some latest Sony VAIO laptops, very viewable even in sunlight. (Boon for those of us who frequent Bryant Park in Manhattan for free wi-fi.)If you are looking for an ultra-portable (i.e., &lt;4 lbs. in total travel weight), check out the Fujitsu P-series and also the great IBM Thinkpad X40. The N5010 is a workhorse, and you can max out your RAM at 2GB. The built-in DVD burner works flawlessly. (The one in my unit is from Toshiba.) It's also quieter than most DVD or CD burner/readers, esp. those low-quality ones Dell uses in their PCs.The Fujitsu is well designed and has all the expansion ports and connectors you'd want. This is one serious laptop ... and the price shows. For what you can do on this thing, it's a decent value. Above all, it's a very solidly built laptop that'll likely last you quite a few years.

I use this device for quickly transferring my mp3 files onto my SD card. It works well.
My wife and I really liked this camera, but we only owned it for a week. Here are some thoughts from an amateur perspective:We were impressed with the picture quality and especially surprised by the performance in low-light conditions. I regularly did not have to use the flash indoors, and still got great pics...Outdoor photos were even better, of course, with landscapes that looked like I was peering out a window. I have a picture of my neighbor's cat that I swear looks better than real life. Gorgeous, with spot-on color, from my amateur's perspective.One thing to remember is that the flash is sort of manual. If you open the flash (requires a flick of the finger, very easy), it becomes fully automatic, but if you keep it closed, the camera will not use the flash, no matter the lighting conditions. This was actually very convenient, and pretty much unique in point-and-shoot cameras.The battery power was also excellent. We took about 100 photos all told, and still hadn't dented the substantial included lithium battery, which the manual, I think, said was good for 250 or so pics, depending on usage of the LCD, which was suitably bright. One feature missing from the camera is a delete button, which is included on newer models. (Deleting photos requires clicking a few buttons)...Ultimately, however, we decided to return the camera, mainly because of its size. It's not a huge camera, smaller than most SLR's and quite manageable. But this was a gift for my wife, and this camera is bulky enough that she would probably only take it for major excursions -- not quick snapshots, etc. We decided to try the LC43 instead, which offers similar specs, although perhaps not quite the solid feel of the LC40, in a more compact package. The LC43 also can be a bit cheaper overall because Panasonic has a rebate deal going for a free 128 MB card. The LC43 also includes rechargeable AAs and a charger. That was also a consideration, despite the excellent battery power on the LC40. For starters, will you even be able to find the expensive proprietary lithium batteries five years from now? AAs are everywhere and cheap, rechargeable or not, and therefore are more convenient for the long-term, I think. Of course, perhaps in five years we will all have traded up to dirt-cheap 12 megapixel SLRs and these will all be on the electronic junkpile...I can update this once we get the LC43 (it's in the mail) for a comparison. One thing I've gleaned from others is that the LC43 flash is a bit on the weak side, relative to the LC40, and has one or two fewer manual controls. But as an amateur looking for a convenient snap-shooter, I'm willing to live with that.Good luck!
I've been testing the F300 for a client and am happy to report this is one excellent digital camera. First of all it's an *affordable* 5+ megapixel digital camera that doesn't exhaust your retirement savings. Second, it sports top-notch picture quality, with well-saturated colors and well-defined clarity. (Fuji's cameras still have the best" color richness.) Then there are tons of features for the geeky type to play with. 3X optical zoom works smoothly, and as you can see from the product photo it's the traditional telescoping type, not the periscoping kind on the X series. Battery life is about average, which is to say "not bad" for a 5+ megapixel camera.The most amaing thing is the number of manual controls Minolta pakcs in with the F-series, which will make every SLR enthusiast at heart leap in joy. I didn't play with the manual controls much except the aperture mode, but I think if you want a digital camera with every imaginable manual adjustment you can think of, Minolta's F-series is the only product line that gives you this power.If you want a dependable digital camera, the F300 deserves a very serious look, and perhaps your next paycheck. (Update: since I first wrote this brief review the F-series has been getting rave editorial reviews from "professional" reviewers. Hence I'm getting one myself when my next paycheck arrives.)Update (9/10/03): The original review was written in May, not long after the F300 came out as successor to the highly acclaimed Dimage F100 3MP camera. Now I'm a proud of owner of an F300, I want to add some additional comments.Starting last month Minolta added four NiMH AA batteries with a 16-hour compact charger, a case, and a bonus CD-ROM to the original camera kit, and also upgraded the included SD memory to 32MB (from 16MB). This move boosted the F300's value and competitiveness against other cameras in this class. Amazon now also has a great price, which makes the F300 cheaper than its competitors from Canon and Sony. The camera itself is made in Japan and exhibits the highest level of build quality.Minolta's user's guide is the best I've seen in a long time. Printed on nice paper and written clearly, it comes in only English, so you don't have to pay for a user's guide in Spanish or French. Lots of high-quality illustrations, and they use a big font. I wish every manufacturer would print their manuals like this. A+!The best features of the F300 are (1) 5.3 megapixels for a great price, (2) lots of manual controls -- great for prosumers, (3) easy control - unlike Canon, Minolta makes it easy for you to adjust resolution and compression level, (4) uses 1 CR-V3 lithium non-rechargeable battery, or 2 AA NiMH batteries, to achieve good battery life -- and NiMH batteries are dirt cheap nowadays. In short, this is a powerful camera with lots of likable features, plus excellent image quality, in a compact, carry-anywhere package.My wish list for Minolta: increase the optical zoom power! 3X is standard, but you guys can win over even more buyers if you go to 5X or 6X. It can't be hard for you guys, can it? :)"
These Maxell CD-Rs are great.First, I've only had one burn failure, which was mainly my fault because it had scratches all over it. The CDs are very reliable, and they have a hard time scratching.The data works like new, unlike some of the other brands (especially Memorex) who's data comes out reading very slow and choppy. But Maxell is perfect, making extra copies of games run perfectly, and without poor graphics and gameplay.Music doesn't sound distorted (like Imatation), and it sounds just as good as the MP3 on your computer.I only have one negative, which is kind of a funny negative. They, for some reason, smell AWFUL! Yes, these discs smell really bad, and don't ask me why because I wouldn't know.I've had a lot of companys of CD-Rs, but Maxell has some of the best, and I highly recommend them. Go through a lot of CD-Rs in a 20 pack? Buy this! You can't go wrong!

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar 512MB Memory Stick Pro, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

I can only give this 4 stars for 1 reason. It's too much like the 18 output modelQ-See QS1210 18 Camera Power Distribution Panelwhich is $20 more.For the extra $20 you get:1 - twice the capacity (add in your dsl modem's wallwart, your router's wall wart, your battery charger's wall wart and clean things up a little)2 - a much better design in the 18 output with a safety shield from the high voltage area3 - room to growThe safety cover alone is worth the $20 extra, so I really would recommend you peek over at that model before buying one. If you only have 4 cameras and a couple chargers that use 12 VDC, then maybe this is OK for you, but if you have power strips plugged into power strips to run all your low voltage stuff, you are a candidate for the 18 port unit.If you are unfamiliar with wiring, these are for the most part safe to work in because you are only wiring 12 VDC - same as your car. The safety shield in the 18 port model really keeps the high voltage away while the 9 port model is more exposed. For a new DIY'er the 18 port system is a better bet - you can read my review of it at the link above.Enjoy getting rid of wallwarts!
In late October RCA released a software update for the RD2840 that fixed two problems: 1. the RD2840 can remember where it left off before shutdown, so when you turn it on, it goes right back to the last song played -- and the start-up time has been significantly shortened. 2. it no longer crashes when playing certain (ill-ripped?) MP3 songs. I maintain my &quot;5-star&quot; rating because it's been such a joy to use. I still envy iPod's nice form factor a bit, but for my money, I got a player that gives very good sound, plays MP3/MP3Pro/WMA, the most popular compressed audio formats in the world, and doubles as a USB 2.0 High Speed external hard drive with plug-and-play when you use it with Windows XP and Windows 2000. Dude, you can't beat this deal! The software update now makes the player &quot;perfect&quot; in function.
1) The list price for this configuration on Toshiba's website is $1163, not $1499.2) The screen is big and bright.3) The machine is too heavy for tablet use, IMHO. It weighs 6.5 pounds with the standard battery which makes it unwieldy to hold in tablet mode. It's almost like holding a newborn baby. If you don't mind the weight, this is a great tablet-notebook PC to get. Otherwise, go for something under 4.5 pounds from Toshiba or Fujitsu. BTW, the AC adapter adds almost another pound to the travel weight.3) 3 USB ports, 1 IEEE-1394 port, SD card slot, built-in mic, built-in 802.11g support, wow! No Bluetooth, but I will never use BT this lifetime because setting up BT is a royal pain in the butt no user should have to live through.
Maxell manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape make it good for recording lectures and music using standard, less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback sound will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.If you pay the Amazon price of $6.99 for the package of seven tapes you spend roughly 99 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the Maxell XL-II. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.
I mainly purchased this GPX CD player to take on the bus at school. First, before I write this review, I must say something very important. AVOID DURABRAND, LENOXX, AND AUDIO SOLUTIONS'S ANTI-SKIP CD PLAYERS! For some reason, THEY SOUND LIKE CRAP!(yeas they all are the same company).The sound of the GPX is not what a Panasonic or Sony player would have, but it is very good. Very neutral, nothing remarkable but nothing bad. The hold function is a very nice feature, it allows me to keep it in my backpack at school rather than taking it out and taking out the batteries. I can just turn it off and switch on the HOLD button. The CDP3104 also has anti-skip protection, which will make it easy for you to use during active activity.There are many features on the player as well. 20-track programming, allowing you to play your CD in the order it was recieved (uh...telephone answering machines?). It also has repeat play, so you can repeat songs. The random play shuffles your CD to give an effect of, say, an Apple iPod Shuffle.There are only few complaints but they probably won't avoid you from buying. GPX only has a 90-day warranty. This is a bad indictation. If your warranty is only 90-days, don't be too suprised if your GPX CD player stops working, say, less than a year. This isn't a problem for me, since I'm only taking it on the bus which will damage it little to none, but just keep that in mind when purchasing. Also, there is no remote nor is there one avaliable. Other than those complaints, than this player is the #1 choice!
The Creative Nomad Zen Xtra MP3 Jukebox is actually an amazing MP3 player, if you can forgive its relatively large size (when compared to the iPod) and clunky user interface (again, when compared to the iPod). Not only does it have SUPERB sound quality, unmatched by iPod or Rio or iRiver, but it sports some features you won't find elsewhere:- volume leveling, so all your tracks have the same volume- time scaling, so you can adjust the playback speed fast or slow, a boon for people who have audiobooks in the MP3 format (the iPod can only adjust the speed of special Audible files)- sleep timer- alarm clock (!!!)- profile settings that remember your preferences, great for sharing with other family members- pretty decent playlist management- works as an external drive in WindowsThese features are all the more amazing because all recent Creative products (Zen Micro, Zen Touch, ...) do NOT have these features. It's sad to me that Creative has taken a step or two back in all these convenience features, which would have made their products compete better against iPod and others. Just sad.In short, if size and jog dial don't turn you off, the Zen Xtra is the best hard drive-based MP3 player.
Iomega ZIP 100 Drive Parallel PortThis device has been in use since the mid-1990s. It allows both storage and transfer since it works on any parallel port, which should be defined as bi-directional" or "EPP". For best results, you should run the "Parallel Port Accelerator" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like with a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. Most printers will operate from the printer port on this unit. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn't work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first ("daisy chaining"). This changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CD-roms. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). Both units have been proven useful over time. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as it works for you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: "SCSI controllers", "Iomega", "Iomega Parallel Port Interface", then "Finish"."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media 512MB xD-Picture Cards XD512-231, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this 512MB card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
My audio systems are mostly all XLR balanced audio inputs, and occasionally I have to connect to 1/8 TRS stereo outputs, for example my PC. This is the perfect cable because I get the left and right channels in XLR format with a single plug into the pc's audio card / motherboard.This cable went into immediate use as soon as it arrived and I will probably order another one because it is close to perfect and I have so many 1/8" stereo connections to make on modern pcs.This combination should be in every cable collection - you'll definitely use it."

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Delkin Devices 1GB CompactFlach Card, like most 1000MB cards, will store on average 1137 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 853 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 512 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 409 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 320 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available. A 1000MB card should be an investment. You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity. Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted. Then what do you do? Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I bought these just to use for back-ups. However, when I listened to these, they became my favorite pair I have.1. The sound quality is amazing, especially at $10. The bass is HUGE, hip-hop fans will love and admire these headphones, I mean can you say big bass ports on the headphones? The treble is nothing special, it's just there, nothing good or bad about it, it's pretty neutral. Mids are fantasic. All in all, sound quality is literally as good as those Sehnneisers across the isle.2. The durability has been great, though it seems to have some weak spots. I will say the most commonly places this pair will break at (if they do) would be at the swivel earcup, the twist where the headband meets the swivel, or the head fitter.3. These headphones are very comfortable. I suppose I could wear them for hours and forget they were on. They don't put on any pressure (sometimes they're too loose) and the fit doesn't have any effect on sound.4. They also come with a big-plug adapter to use on DJ equipment or hi-fi stereo systems.5. LOOK AROUND! The price for these headphones range from $10-$25, literally (even though I would pay $25 for these). I got them at a Ross store for $10, my guess is that is the lowest price around.6. The bending parts get stuck to your hair often. Long haired people will find this slighty annoying and painful.7. As far as comparisions, they sound better than the similar Sony model MDRV150 and Koss model UR15C. They are almost or at the same sound as the HD202.8. Overall, this is a very good deal for me. These headphones are comparable to $30 headphones at 1/3 the price. The sound, comfort, and durability should be good enough to push you into buying these headphones!
This was an item I originally decided to try on sale at a store here in New York--and overall, I am pretty much satisfied with it. It records images and audio very faithfully and the audio and images have not decreased in quality over time on any of my disks!You occasionally get a surprise coaster, however. It seems like as many as one out of ten disks turns into a coaster after the recording process goes seemingly uneventfully. This can be a nasty surprise, especially if you've just copied oh, say, six hours of VCR tape onto the DVD-R disk. So, what do you do? You already knew it--you're stuck back at square one and you have to burn the DVD-R all over again from the beginning--on another blank disk.On the other hand, I suppose that at least nine out of ten disks being absolutely fine (in other words, at least a 90% performance rate) isn't too bad BUT for a person who just can't be bothered with this drawback I honestly have to recommend you try another brand of DVD-R media.Nevertheless, the price IS right and for those of us on a budget such as college students (or me!) you really can't go too wrong with this brand of DVD-R media. If you don't mind an infrequent coaster I would go with this brand, especially when on sale, unless your needs are more professional or you have a time deadline to get a project done. It has never damaged any of my three DVD players! Moreover, the packaging is excellent--very sturdy.
The Adesso Easycat touchpad is made by a company called Cirque which is a division of the Japanese accessories company ALPS, which makes most of the touchpads for laptops. The touchpad is sensitive and accommodates click, double-click, drag, and also right-click (in the upper righthand triangle area). For 35 bucks it comes in a plain OEM-like box and feels rather cheap, but it's plug-n-play on widnows 2000 and xp. I'm pretty happy with it.
This is an amazing camera (save for the battery life) for an amazing price. While it does not have optical zoom, the digital zoom is better than most digicams I have used -- including my own Canon S100 digital elph." The picture quality is simply superb and seals Olympus's reputation for producing some of the finest-quality digital cameras in the world. The operations are all easy to learn, esp. if you have used an Olympus analog before.The only gripe is battery life, which is ridiculously short on regular alkalines. (On the other hand, it's nice to have a digicam that takes AAs.) Be sure to get lithium rechargeable batteries for this camera. They are more expensive, but they provide much longer battery life (so you can take the camera out on a day trip without hauling 10 pairs of alkalines) and can be recharged.Once you get the batteries straightened out, this is simply the best-value digital camera on the market. I bought one for my wife and one for her uncle. Both love the camera. Highly recommended."

TDK manufactures excellent 60 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 60 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 30 blank minutes for recording on each side. This is useful when recording thirty minute talk shows, for example. The normal bias recording tape and the low noise surface enhance the overall quality of your recording, too.If you pay the Amazon price of $7.98 for the eight-pack you spend roughly 99 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many, many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a TDK cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a TDK cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK normal bias 60 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.
Every olympus owner knows that sometimes with all the accessories the camera can become a bit off balance or jittery/difficult to control. The GS-2 is the solution.The GS-2 securely fastens between any two olympus brackets" (those slot things on the camera frame or accessory) that are about 4.5-5.0 inches apart. The buckle mechanism is very secure to hold onto your camera with the GS-2, even using one hand - but not recommendedThe inside (the part against your skin) is a velvet like texture while the outside (away from your skin) is a nylon fabric with a fastener for the grip adjustment. Each one (top and bottom) are secured separately.Because of the flexibility you can use the GS-2 with many cameras, accessories, and models so long as there is a 4.5-5.0 inch gap between the hook. You can also adjust the amount of space between your hand and the camera to make it tight or loose.It does seem a bit expensive at 30 bucks but considering the cost of dropping your camera, it's a deal. Left hand or right hand doesn't matter either.Overall I'm satisfied with mine because I can hold the camera more steady without a monopod or other gizmo. That's where the value comes in. The belt can be let out or pulled in as needed to cinch up the tension on the grip. It also has some generous padding inside it which makes using it comfortable. I find it useful under many situations holding the camera with just one hand.When you are out in the field without a tripod this gizmo is a life saver. It is lightweight, comfortable, and well engineered."
This cartridge is a fantastic substitute for the Epson brand cartridges, it performes as well as the Epson cartridges, and gives me a higher page count.
This battery holds a charge and works just like the original one that came with the camera - very happy so far!
I bought this TDK 3-pack 8cm DVD-RW discs for my Panasonic VDR-D300 camcorder. I've been using two of the three discs; haven't opened the last disc yet. The discs seems quite reliable and they work well in my Panasonic VDR-D300. I also bought TDK's 5-pack 8cm DVD-R discs; I'll review those as well.BTW, the DVD-RW disc can be re-written and/or re-formatted about 1,000 times total, but I've heard that after 500 or so times write and read speeds will drop off dramatically. This compares to up to 100,000 times for DVD-RAM, which is also used by Panasonic's DVD camcorders.
Great to see the movies on a bigger screen. After learning that Apple had simply switched the leads when they manufactured their own iPod AV cable." They did that to trick people into purchasing their own AV cables. At any rate, this AV cable is higher quality than iPod's, it 's retractable, and works with iPods.Good one."
IOMEGA ZIP 100 DiskThe IOMEGA ZIP 100 disk is a high-capacity removable storage disk that is about the size of a standard 3.5 floppy disk. It can be read and written by an internal IDE drive (only one per system) or an external drive connected to a USB port or a parallel port (slowest in access). The IomegaWare Software provides utility functions designed for the ZIP disk, such as formatting or copying a disk. You should never use the Operating System disk copy function. Use the EJECT utility to remove a disk from a drive; this is required in Windows NT or Windows 2000. Remove the disk before turning a computer off You should never insert a ZIP disk in the drive when the computer is on as this can cause damage. Normally, shutting down the computer causes the disk to eject. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole.The IomegaWare software tests for the presence of the ZIP drive. It should be used in Windows 2000 to format a ZIP disk in the FAT format. Removable disks can contain a lot of data when it can be partitioned into 100 MB segments. The data on a ZIP drive can be read and written by different versions of an Operating System (using the FAT format). Rewriting reuses space, it does not increase the used space. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat (sunshine). The 100 MB ZIP disks can be read and written by a 250 MB disk drive. These disks use the FAT16 format so only 151 entries are allowed in its root directory. Files should be stored in folders to best use space. This also applies to memory sticks (unless they use the FAT32 format).To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
It is a question that all digital camera enthusiasts ask themselves shortly after purchasing a digital camera, but it is one that is not easily answered as there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. This review will help to guide you to the best solution based off the characteristics and specifications of the Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera. I feel I am qualified to provide this information as I was in the memory industry for 7 years but having left the industry a year ago, I can be completely unbiased on this subject.One of the biggest factors to consider is the megapixel rating of this Samsung camera. Considering this particular camera is generally considered to be a 4MP digital camera. You can expect to store approximately 32 images on a 64MB card, 64 pictures on a 128MB flash card, 128 digital pictures on digital film of 256MB capacity, 256 pics on a 512MB picture card, 512 images on a 1GB media card, 1,024 photos on a 2GB flash card, and a monstrous 2,048 digital photos on a 4GB card. These image/picture calculations assume that you are going to utilize the full potential of your camera but won't shoot in RAW mode. In other words, the estimates are for shooting at the highest JPEG setting available for the Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera. Understand that they are indeed estimates and can vary based off the actual scene or subject being shot and the amount of light, color variation, detail, etc. in the photo. You can assume these numbers are accurate within 10%.However how many images a card can hold is not the only factor you should consider before buying this all important accessory. You should also consider that you may want to use your Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera to take shots of sporting events, wildlife, or even your child's unique expressions. These moments have a very small window of opportunity to get the shot you desire thus a flash card that has been rated by experts as being a faster card may be something to consider. In my opinion, it is always best to find a review of a flash card as it performed in your specific digital camera. Some cameras just work better with specific flash cards do to the software, firmware, buffer utilization, etc. between the camera and the flash card. Finding an answer to this question is not usually an easy task. There is, though, a superb website that not only offers flash card reviews but also has an extensive user forum that can answer this all important question for you. You may want to take a look at dpreview dot com and then do a search for the Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera in the forums area, if that doesn't work just do a search on Samsung and you should be able to find someone that can help you. I am fairly certain you will have plenty of information to make an informed buying decision. You may also want to look at their detailed review of this particular camera as well if you have not yet decide on whether to purchase it.Of course one of the next factors to consider is in regards to price. Please, do not make the mistake that I have made of buying the absolute cheapest flash card. Take a look at the factors I have mentioned here before you make a purchase. Think of a flash card for your Samsung camera as an extension to it. Just as you wouldn't purchase the cheapest camera case for your camera (personally I own the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack but I like the extra room and the backpack style, which may not be your cup of tea) don't necessarily purchase the cheapest flash card either. Keep in mind that you will use this card every single time you use your camera. Like I said it is truly an extension of your digital camera.The final thing I will mention is in regards to service. There are a number of flash card suppliers in the world today. However all of the flash cards are actually built by a handful (3 - 5) of companies and even those companies only have a few options (2 - 4) regarding which components they are going to use in their particular design. More or less, the actually hardware inside each flash card is going to be similar but the way in which they utilize that hardware and the level of support they will provide, given there is a problem, are more paramount. Just imagine going 10 days without a flash card for your camera (which I did) because you are waiting for some company to repair your flash card, or worse yet having it fail and having no recourse. There are a couple of manufacturers that do very well in regards to utilizing technology and providing customer service. As of the time of this writing they are SanDisk, Lexar, and Viking. However check the newsgroups and forums for the latest information as it can be very cyclical and unfortunately can take a turn for the worse overnight.No matter what flash card you decide to use with your digital camera make sure you take the time to take the pictures. Time flies by fast and having thousands of images to thumb through 5 years from now to remind you of the time that has gone by will be the most powerful investment of all. I have personally purchased a SimpleTech external hard drive to store my images on (another reason I like the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack as it gives me room to put in my hard drive). The hard drive combined with the backpack allows me to take my photos with me when I go visit family and friends. I use PhotoShop exclusively to do all my photo editing and batch processing (a great feature of PhotoShop) and of course make occasional backups to DVD-RW.Enjoy your Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera. I hope this review has informed you how this camera can be best enhanced by a flash card and the best approach in finding one that meets your specific needs.
This cartridge is very light, easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality, durable black ink on the page. It is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (It even comes with an expiration date!) HP also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit.One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the ink can go quickly. If you print a lot, you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. My needs are about 20 pages per week and I have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks. That's not good; although to be fair to this HP ink cartridge I am printing graphics.Four stars (well, maybe three and one half stars) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge. It loses points for not lasting longer.
My first impression of the new NZ90 was how big the thing it was. It's got to be the biggest PDA I have ever seen... and I've seen a lot of them in the last 5 years. The black finish doesn't make it look slim at all. On the contrary, the whole thing looks and feels like a brick.For the price and size and weight, you get a PDA that has everything you'll want, from wireless to rich multimedia to built-in &quot;high res&quot; camera. The basic functions are quite speedy, and the screen is gorgeous. The thumbboard will take a bit getting used to, but is easy to use after a few minutes of practice.I'm not convinced, though, that anyone really needs something like this. (Of course, &quot;want&quot; is an entirely different question.) For a bit more size and weight and money, you could get a nicely equipped subnotebook, which seems more useful, esp. if you touch-type. The NX70V is large but still portable. The NZ90 is just way too big.
The ink is a perfect match with my Dell Photo All-in-One printer 966. I will buy again
I installed two 128 MB PC2100 DDR by Simpletech and was really estatic about the change. I was able to open more windows and noticed how my computer has been flying fast now. It was a good price and works great.
As far as other reviews, there must be a high defective rate because I dropped mine uncountable times and it plays like new.As far as sound, it has the same bass settings as previous Walkmans. No bass, bass boost, and full bass, but this player lists them as sound one and two. Volume goes pretty high but not high enough to hurt your hearing.This player has enough features to make the $30 worth it. It has a bass boost, repeat one, repeat all, program, and shuffle. Don't expect a radio or MP3 features since this is only 30 bucks, but there are other models that are a little more expensive with these features. The LCD is okay when it held by your hand but very unreadable on a desk or platform unless your far enough away from it, then the numbers get small. The LCD on earlier Walkmans were larger and were slanted so they were readable above. This player as I know of comes in five colors, white, light blue, light green, pink, light orange (which looks to similar to the pink...sorry), and the more expensive ones are in black. Most guys will find any color other than black or white (maybe green) girly", so stick with white, green, or black for guys (if your getting it as a present). The headphones are okay. They have a rubber grip that goes over your ear easily, then you can twist the earbud to fit better. I also found that you can make the grips come off and you can use them as earbuds only, the sound is the same. Sound of the headphones is okay, not as good as the Sony street style but better than the h.ear. There is also a hold button on the back if you want to ever travel with it. The back is white on all models like this. There is also an AC adapter on the top. There is no line out, make sure your not using this for a stereo. Overall it's pretty light and not too bulky. So far it's read every disc I threw in it, only ones with heavy scratches would not play (it overall did better than the Philips).Overall, you should be happy with your purchase as long as it works! 4 stars."
3M has long been known for their series of office products from the postit note to gizmos like this. The copyholder allows you to place a reference book, printout, or other material for use in writing a thesis, etc. The bar allows you to hold your place while working on your computer.The heft and weight of the aparatus is sufficient to hold heavy books or large printouts without tipping over or loosing your place.Years ago, prior to the advent of the xerox machine, a copyholder was an essential desktop aparatus since administrative staff used typewriters and carbon paper to reproduce the original document placed in the copyholder. Today we write documents on computers and include captions from books. Another useful feature is organization - all paper documents (statements, bills, etc) can be stacked in the copyholder to pay bills using online banking. This version can also hold electronic devices next to your pc (Ipad, etc) for easy transfer of data between your ipod and your pc.while not cheap, the 3M version is well built and will last a long time
Maxell makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust. The sleeves come in five colors: blue, yellow, green, red, and orange. This allows you the option of color coding types of CDs if you wish by putting all CDs or DVDs in one category into a certain single color sleeve.The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves!They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room.Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves. I highly recommend these CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical alternative to jewel cases.
Very high quality, works like a high-speed hard drive in the right recorders (e.g., Panasonic's DVD recorders) or burners. Good price, partly because this is 4.7GB not 9.4GB.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media 256MB SD Card SD256-231, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I have used these cameras many times on vacation and the pictures really DID come out fairly well! Oh, sure, the quality of the pictures won't be 100% as good as the pictures you would get from a digital camera or a standard, more expensive and more professional 35 mm camera. The pictures may at times be slightly grainy but they provide excellent records and memories of my experiences.The camera also is very lightweight so you can carry several at a time in a bag as you travel. I especially like the built in flash that is easy to use (just push a button in the back of the camera and after 10 seconds or so the flash is ready). I remember my mother's Kodak Instamatic camera from the 1960s when if your flash cube had been used (after only four pictures) you were out of luck unless you had another flash cube. No such problem here! Thank goodness!The camera is a single use camera; this means that after you use it you take the entire camera to the place where you can get film developed and they will take care of the rest. No worrying about whether or not you removed the roll of film negatives correctly without exposing them to too much light. The Kodak MAX" 800 film speed also makes it useful for taking pictures under a wide variety of lighting situations! You get 27 exposures, not just 24--a nice plus! SMILEOverall, this is an excellent camera for the many, many people who want to travel light or who are on a budget. It is compact and easy to carry; keep one in the glove compartment of your car just in case there's an accident and you need to take pictures of the scene. The camera is also affordable. I give it four stars instead of five simply because the picture quality just isn't the very best although for most people like me the pictures it takes are fine. Thank you, Kodak!"
Has anyone tried this multizone" model yet? Does it allow me to watch DVDs from any country? How's it different operationally from the normal LS5? Thanks."
This lens hood designed specificaly for the Coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory. It does more than just protecting the lens, which it certainly does, esp. for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid. (Don't forget Murphy's Law.)But the lens hood can also improve your picture quality. As with SLR lenses, the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture. This is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused (scattered). Just use this all the time (see exception below) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best (all other factors being equal, of course).The only times you should *NOT* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700, esp. indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source. The hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject. Even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light, you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure.Get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera.
The new Casio Exilim EX-S100 continues the company's tradition of making super-thin, credit card-sized digital cameras, only this time it has a retractable 3x optical zoom which is just amazing to watch as it comes out and goes in. Supposedly Casio engineers had to invent a new kind of ceramic lens to make it fit inside the EX-S100's thin (~0.6) body. It weighs less than 5 oz. even with its proprietary LiIon battery.The image quality on this camera is typical of consumer-grade, cmopact digital cameras, which is to say it's acceptable for everyday shots. The first reviewer had a good point that this camera is perfect as a second digital camera; I think it's good to have a more powerful camera that gives you more controls and more pixels if you want to do any semi-serious photography (e.g., travel photography). The EX-S100 is perfect for carrying around and snapping pictures in the park, on the street, or at a party. Its relatively fast recycle time also makes it easy to use when you are in the mood for candid shots, plus the 2.8X optical zoom helps pull things closer. (The optical zoom is important here since its 3MP resolution does not allow for a lot of cropping.)The LCD screen on the back is big and bright but the resolution could be better. This means the image on the LCD is a bit coarse. This sucks because this camera doesn't have an optical viewfinder.This last point raise an important performance issue: because the camera is light and doesn't have a viewfinder, when you compose your shot through the LCD, be sure to hold the camera very steady! Don't pinch it hard. Just relax but keep your arms, wrists and hands steady. Press the shutter after you insale and as you hold you breath. Learn to use your thumbs to counter-act the downward force from the press-down on the shutter. This simple tip should steer you clear of lots of blurry pictures... after you practice. :)This camera is definitely the hottest digital camera this holiday season, hence the price premium for a 3MP shooter. Is 3MP enough? I think it is for most everyday situations. If you plan to crop a lot later on and still want gorgeous 6x4" or larger prints, you should consider a 4MP or 5MP camera. But I bet 95% of us consumers don't crop 95+% of the time, and this Exilim is really to be used as a point-and-shoot, so the 3MP is not a real issue. As I mentioned, the overall picture quality of this "card cam" (I think that's what Casio's calling them now) is pretty good, better than 3MP digital cameras from just a couple years ago.So, if you want an impressive second digital camera or just want a thin and small and stylish camera for everyday photography, the Exilim deserves a serious look."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Viking CF64M-IT 64MB Compact Flash - Industrial Temp, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Holds CDs well.Very vibrant color.Sort of hard to put things in the pouch. I still like it.Hard to use strap. Broke of in a week.Haven't used warranty yet.Good cost.CD Case - 3.6/5

Heavy Listener" is a liar, period. This Sony "Psyc" MP3 player plays MP3 just fine, include VBR MP3 files. For WMA you'll need to use SonicStage to convert it to ATRAC3Plus first; this takes as little as 30 seconds on a fast P4 PC or as much as 3-4 minutse on a slow P3 PC for a typical song.The player is easy to use and goes on for 50-70 hours on a single regular AAA battery. Get the new Panasonic Oxyride battery (same price as regular alkalines) and you can go over 100 hours on the same battery!"
The Fujifilm 1GB Type M" xD flash memory card works in the latest models of digital cameras from Fujifilm, Olympus and other manufacturers that utilize the xD format. The "Type M" designation means this memory card uses on-board compression and decompression as data are written and read. Without the compression, xD memory cards cannot achieve more than 512MB of storage since they are physically so small. This compression, however, does cause incompatibility with older digital cameras that must use the "regular" type of xD card. This means 1) you should check the digital camera's manufacturer website to see if your particular model can use "Type M" xD card; and 2) if not, you can only use up to 256MB xD cards without compatibility concerns.(There's a different kind called "Type H" xD card which uses a different compression scheme than "Type M" cards. I haven't seen any Type H cards being sold in the U.S. yet.)This Fujifilm 1GB card is manufacturered by either Toshiba in Japan or Samsung in South Korea. BE SURE TO GET THE TOSHIBA VERSION! My first two were made by Samsung and both failed after a few uses. Very terrible quality. I almost wanted to write a one-star review here on Amazon. But my third card, which I finally ordered from Amazon, was made by Toshiba and it's been working totally fine even in sub-freezing temperatures. So heed my advice: if your card is marked "korea - made by samsang" be sure to return it and get another one from another store. You just don't want to risk using a poor-quality memory card. Shame on Fujifilm for shortchanging its customers. (Update: I got two from Amazon and both are made by Toshiba.)(Unfortunately, you cannot tell who manufactured the card from the packaging. It just says "Made in Japan or S. Korea." You'll have to cut-open the packaging to see the marking on the back of the card itself. So be sure to buy from a store that allows full-refund returns.)The xD card has pretty good read and write speeds. As I mentioned earlier, the "Type M" designation means the employment of data compression, but this is totally transparent to the user, i.e., you needn't think about it at all. I've read on the web that this compression does entail a small speed penalty, but for all practical purposes you won't notice a thing at all. The bottleneck is usually with the camera I/O (input/output circuirty) so the tiny speed penalty is not going to matter. Again, be sure to get the Toshiba version of this card so ensure highest reliability and speed.In the end, I feel this is a good memory card. And the one I bought from Amazon made by Toshiba has proven itself just as reliable as my Lexar CompactFlash and Secure Digital cards. I haven't had any problems at all. On the other hand, the design specs of the xD card cast a shadow on its future.In terms of performance, I think if you don't need to shoot a lot of pictures at a time, a 256MB xD card, which uses no compression (at least not as much as Type M), is a better choice, both for speed and durability considerations. In fact, I now think I should have gotten 2 or 3 256MB xD cards instead of a single 1GB one. If I store 1,000 pictures on this and it fails, I lose the 1,000 pictures."
(Note: The only difference between the Toshiba e750 and e755 is that the latter e755 comes with a photo viewer software title on the companion CD. In fact, the machine in the e755 packaging says e750".)Featuring a new mobile processor, the most internal memory of any PDA, built-in wi-fi, dual CF/SDIO slots, and good battery life, the e750/e755 is close to being perfect. The compact and attractive form factor is a huge plus, as well. The new Intel processor is the star of the line-up. It's an updated version of the Xscalar processor, which wasn't getting good reviews due to lack of optimization options. The e750/e755 allows you to switch between two speeds, hence you can choose between higher speed or better battery life. Even at the lower speed, PPC apps feel quick and responsive. The battery is also user replaceable. What's left to improve for Toshiba is their lackluster customer support. Because their PPCs are made by an OEM in Taiwan rather than in their own plants in Japan, the build quality is still a bit lacking, but the e750/e755 seems to be better made than the e740, which was getting a lot of complaints.See my e750 review for more updated details.

(Note: The only difference between the e750 and e755 is that the latter e755 comes with a photo viewer software title on the companion CD. In fact, the machine in the e755 packaging is labeled &quot;e750,&quot; so I'll refer to it as e750 in this review.)Featuring a new mobile processor, the most internal memory of any PDA (64MB RAM plus 64MB non-RAM for a total of 128MB), built-in 802.11b wi-fi, the best PDA screen from Toshiba so far. and good battery life, the e750/e755 is close to being perfect. The compact (0.6 inches thin) and attractive form factor is a huge plus, as well.The new Intel processor (PXA255 running at 400Mhz) is without doubt the star of the new line-up. It's an updated version of the first-gen Xscalar processor, which wasn't getting good reviews due to lack of optimization options. The e750/e755 *is* optimized for the new processor, which results in speedy application launches and operations. Nothing gives a Pocket PC user more pleasure than seeing his/her favorite app come up instantly. The e750 also allows you to switch between two speeds, hence you can choose between higher speed or better battery life. Even at the lower speed, PPC apps feel quick and responsive. The LiIon battery is user replaceable, and an optional &quot;extended&quot; battery is available now from Toshiba.What's left to improve for Toshiba is their lackluster customer support. Also, because their PPCs are made by an OEM in Taiwan rather than in their own plants in Japan, the build quality is still a bit lacking, but the e750/e755 seems to be better made than the error-prone e740.Update with more details:The e750 is indeed a joyful PDA! The high price and the lack of a built-in camera aside -- but who really needs the latter, right? -- it really comes close to being a master-of-all-trades device. I haven't tested the wireless features as much as I had hoped, due to the fact there just aren't many free hot spots around these days. But I'll update this review when I get more hands-on experience in this area.In terms of everyday use this is a true workhorse. I'll talk more about the specs below, but the numbers don't really reveal how pleasant using the e750 is. The hundreds of annoyances that plagued the e740, its older cousin, have been fixed. There are far fewer crashes and syncs go more smoothly. At just 6.5 ounces, while not the lightest Pocket PC, you get something very close to a handheld computer, especially when you get the foldable keyboard!The e750 has a total of 128MB of RAM, 32 of which is ROM, 32 is flash-ROM (which means content stored on it won't go away even if the battery is completely dead... think of it as a small hard disk without moving parts), and the rest 64 is true user-accessible RAM. Having a real 64MB to play with is a bliss, especially for someone like me who started out with 16MB on the Casio EM-500 and last saw 46MB on the HP iPaq 1910. The extra 18MB makes a big difference. Now I can play Doom and Quake at the same time!Given the thin form factor of the e750, it still amazes me how it can feature both a Type I/II CompactFlash (CF) slot as well as a Secure Digital (SD) slot. Since wi-fi is already built-in, both can happily be used solely for storage expansion. The highest capacity for SD right now (as of April 2003) is 512MB, but that costs a small fortune. The best value belongs to 256MB cards, and I highly recommend the one from Lexar (see my review there). If you put in a 512MB SD and a 512MB CF, you'll get 1GB of extra storage for under one-hundred-fifty dolrs! The CF slot can probably be used for other peripherals; but the situation is not clear right now as to which CF peripherals will be supported in the e750.The 3.8-inch (measured diagonally) screen is the largest among Pocket PCs on the market today, and the best from Toshiba so far. I personally like the screens on the iPaq 1910 and Viewsonic V35 better, but this screen is more than &quot;good.&quot; The resolution is still PPC's standard 240x320, so it would be nice to see someday PPC manufacturers would go higher than that. I'd love a PPC the size of the e750 but with a 4&quot; screen and 320x480 resolution!There are a lot of optional accessories you can get for the e750, including the foldable keyboard and extended battery mentioned above. This is truly an exciting newcomer to the PPC family... one that looks and performs like a winner.
This Atlantic CD Storage Case makes attractive CD storage a reality. It requires little assembly and the cherry wood base and details at the top add a sense of refinement that you don't always get with a CD storage rack. The rack fits in a corner, a closet or just about anywhere as it is compact yet big enough to hold up to 110 single jewel case CDs in a compact, vertical space.In addition, the wavy black colored steel rods going up and down the sides of the CD rack are tastefully designed; this is one CD storage tower that won't ever be an eyesore! The wavy design fits in especially well with modern or contemporary d&eacute;cor.One reviewer notes that this CD storage rack doesn't hold too many CD double sized jewel cases." In my opinion, they're partly right. It can hold two or three of the double sized jewel cases on each level of the tower--and with nine "levels" that's about eighteen double sized jewel cases. Not too bad. If you need storage for more double size jewel cases, however, you may want to consider another type of CD storage rack or case.Overall, this attractive, easy to assemble storage tower houses CDs very well and the cherry wood base and details give it a handsome appearance. It goes particularly well with modern or contemporary d&eacute;cor and it lasts forever (mine's about two or three years old already). The rack is easy to move about as it is only six or seven pounds at the most when empty; and you can even place it in a closet if you wish to keep it there for any reason."
This inkjet printer is designed for the home or small office. It uses a USB cable to connect to a computer. You should connect the USB cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the printer. It can be used with Windows 98, Me, 2000 and XP. The black inkjet cartridge is the #20, the tricolor inkjet cartridge is the #49. HP does not recommend refilling either cartridge. These cartridges may be hard to find nowadays. This printer works well for the average user. When installing the printer you may have to create a USB Virtual printer port if another printer was previously defined (not for printers connected to a parallel port). If you bought a used printer you can download the printer software and instruction manual.Be sure to read the warnings in the manual about proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. At one time HP used to sell a container to store cartridges when they were not in use. I do not keep power connected to the printer when it is not in use; heat is the enemy of electronic devices (two surge suppressors).HP seems to have a policy of planned obsolescence" in manufacturing new printers that use new inkjet cartridges. After a while it becomes harder to quickly purchase replacement cartridges. This may be due to progress in cartridge design. Like other HP printers the paper path takes a U-turn in printing so the printer uses less desk space.This printer has a different colored case but seems identical to the HP 656C printer."
This CompactFlash SmartMedia Combo Reader by SimpleTech is a handy tool to have. Instead of transfering files or photos slowly, this is a faster connection. I recommend it.
Initially I was thinking of getting a Sandisk 4GB Memory Stick PRO Duo for my PSP, for about $10 cheaper. But I had some negative experience with Sandisk flash memory cards before so I decided to get the real Sony one. I haven't had my Sony 4GB for long enough to know its long-term durability, but so far it's been totally worth the extra 10 bucks. It's fast and reliable, which gives me a peace of mind (worth more than $10, I hope). You get about 3700MB of usable storage which is still plenty.This will hold my game saves and a couple movies plus my favorite episodes from The Simpsons as well as some MP3 files and photos for a while. I look forward to the day when Sony upgrades the PSP's firmware to allow the use of the upcoming 8GB (reportedly already available in Japan) and 16GB Memory Stick PRO Duo cards.
I run alot of differential audio links with 1/4 or xlr inputs, so the ability to change from RCA consumer equipment to my mixer inputs is important. These cables are just the trick. The 1/4" plugs are heavily strain reliefed as are the RCA plugs. This allows me to connect my marantz PMD 661 recorder to my mixer MARANTZ PMD661 PMD-661 DIGITAL RECORDER. None of the handheld digital recorders use their xlr connections as outputs -- you don't get that feature until the luggable recorders or the rackmount recorders, so these cables are important.I also own a HOSA 3.5mm TRS to 1/4" dual plug stereo cable and have had great success with it.As for value - you can not build a stereo cable for this price with 4 connectors and 2x 9.9 ft of cable. I build alot of custom cables and the parts value alone is well worth it. I'm glad amazon teamed up with hosa for their product line."
I'd purchased a total of 3 Apex DVD players prior to getting this model, and all three have been working loyally, with the oldest one still doing well after two years, so I figured for this price, if I could get 2-3 years of service out of it until the next technological advance comes along, it would be worth it.The AD-2600 is not Apex's first progressive-scan model, but it has a more solid feel than Apex's prior offerings. Like with all Apex players, the 2600 plays lots and lots of formats, from DVD to VCD to Kodak to CD to recordable and rewritable discs. This is not a fancy player, and some of the functions are not well documented and feel kinda crude to operate, but hey, it works well and you just can't beat the price! Progress scan is only evident if you have a digital TV (DTV). If you do have one, you'll notice the difference, big-time. Images become so much sharper and clearer, and you'd never want to go back to interlaced pictures again. Notice that progressive scan only improves video, not audio. For best video results, get the component (not composite) cables. All DTVs have component video inputs, and you *must* take advantage of those.Recommended if you watch a lot of DVDs.
This is an excellent carrying case for digital cameras; I have used it for awhile now and I am quite satisfied with it. The camera case comes with a main pocket for carrying the actual camera; and there are two smaller front pockets for carrying a memory card and even an extra battery! I particularly like that the black carrying case by Lowepro uses bright orange threaded stitching so you can easily find pocket openings; and the Velcro that helps to keep one of the extra pockets closed is very sturdy. The water resistant fabric is impressive and practical--it has been really helpful on several occasions when I got caught outdoors in rainy weather.The attachable straps for the shoulder or belt could be made a bit stronger; they aren't all that bad either but I will take off one star for this disappointment. As another reviewer notes, you can always go out and purchase another strap that's stronger and more to your liking. Bring the camera case with you to make sure that the new strap will fit.This case comes in many colors but black is the most neutral. Keep in mind another plus: This might also be useful for carrying a cell phone or really any device that can fit inside the case.I just plain like the way this carrying case is designed to protect the entire digital camera; I can't think of many negatives to tell you about this digital camera carrying case. I'll be using this for quite some while to come.
I purchased this jWIN radio because I was shopping at a Ross store, which carries lots of inexpensive items from low-end brands like Coby, jWIN, iConcepts/Sakar, Protocool, etc, and this radio was under $10, and it looked like it could be also used for shower/bath use, and I don't need one bad enough to pay over $20 for one.Before I even opened the box, I knew the earbuds were going to be very poor. My prediction was correct. However, using a nice pair of Sonys, the sound quality was excellent. I still use the earbuds in the bath/shower so if the earbuds get soaked, I can get a new radio, and if I use the Sonys, well...I'm out $20. The built-in-speaker could have its treble lowered, but for $7, I'm not complaining. What I can say is that the speaker is far better than a comparable Jensen.I like that it's water resistant, meaning it can be used in steam and minorly wet areas. It can be used for baths but for showers you may want to have a hook so it won't get too wet. One dissappointment is that it's not digital, so you can lock off buttons if you have the radio in your pocket. Though, it does have a belt clip, so you can have it under your shirt under rainy weather, or you may want to hide jWIN so people think you have a radio over $20 lol. Oh, make sure you have a screwdriver to open the AAA battery compartment. I had to use scissors, and, that didn't turn out well lol. Radio reception for both AM and FM was minorly staticy on stations further than 30 miles, but satisfactory otherwise.Overall, this jWIN radio is a great radio for someone looking for a sports radio or a radio used near steam or water, but doesn't want to spend a fortune for a Sony.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The PNY 64MB SD Secure Digital Flash Memory Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
8/9/05 UPDATES:So far so good. I am still enjoying my iRiver. I think my friend wants one, but it's kind of a waste of money since he doesn't even have a 128 CD case yet, and hasn't filled his 64. Besides, he has Windows 98, and the iRiver is only compatable with XP, Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X. The reason I am resumbitting my review is to point out a couple of things I didn't mention before.1) Songs cannot play in album order. Though you can do this by using the quick list, it becomes frustratingg after awhile.2) The battery life seemingly lasts more than 16 hours under normal use, more around 20-22 hours, depending on your usage.3) The battery is not swappable, HOWEVER, iRiver's site said YET...meaning they are making a swapple battery for the H10-20GB. The battery lasts around 4 years, however shortens slowly after the third year. iRiver's website states at 4 years, the battery life will be dropped around -4 hours. Which means even if you get it now your battery will never die.4) The player DOES seem to support .wav files. I by accident added a .wav file and my friend accidentally played it. The player played the four minute .wav file just fine without hesistation.5) You can NOT add a song to an exisiting playlist that has been added to the player, a little frustrating. You have to delete the file in My Computer and then add the song again. This could take an immense amount of time if you want to add a large amount of certain songs.6) Imo, CNET's review should be redone, as they say the navigation is difficult, when it's easy as pie.So far, I still LOVE my iRiver. So, it's not 100% perfect, but the firmware hasn't even been upgradeable yet, meaning they are working on some new firmware for the H10-20GB.And, if you haven't read my earlier review, it is posted below.7/5/05:I recently bought and returned the YH925GS. Not only did it not have an FM tuner (didn't care that much), but adding, modifying, and deleting files was becoming a BIG pain.The MP3 player is pretty slim, even though it's not the slimmest one you can buy, it's light so if you like jogging with it or excersising you'll barely notice it. Like all 20 GB MP3 players, you can store 5,000 songs (approx. 400 CDs). The controls look strange at first, but actually, all you need to control is the touchpad. There are also arrows for them most easy navigation. You'll notice that it's easier to use than most MP3 players on the market today. The battery life is 16 hours. Some of today's players have more than 20 hours, but I guess 16 is okay.The player also comes with a 1.8 LCD screen, and more colors than a computer so your photos will look of professional quality. On this player, something that most if not all players can't do, is view .txt files. This is a really cool feature. You can store lyrics or essays in Notepad, then transfer them into the player. This is a VERY cool feature that I will be using more often.The sound is really good. It doesn't have WOW features that most MP3 players have, but it has a very decent equalizer. The sound isn't distored at all, and I'm suprised about this.The player also comes with recordings and FM tuning. THe microphone can pick up voice pretty far, and the FM tuner is quite good too. There are also 20-preset stations for your tuner. And listen to this one, you can rip off of the radio. How cool is that? Say your listen to the radio, and you hear this hot new track that is so good, you can just press record, and you can listen to it whenever you want. It's not that other players don't do this, it's that this is the 1 of 2 players that has the fantasic combination of 20 GB, Radio, and Recording. (the iAudio X5 is the other player that has this...I didn't buy it because it doesn't allow you to change track settings, WTF?)It's also PlaysForSure compatible, but to use WMP 10, you have to download the drivers from the iRiver website. Unless you have a lot of music on WMP, I would just stick to the drag-n-drop. It's not just drag-n-drop (e.g. My Computer, iRiver) or WMP 10 that's compatable. RealPlayer is compatable, and Napster is too (but I think Napster sucks). To put photos on your MP3 player, you can use the manual drag-n-drop. As a matter of fact, the My Computer>iRiver method is probably the best. I have no reason why you would want/need WMP 10 or Real to manage music. Though, I guess to have further options, you would need it. But otherwise, it's VERY easy to add tracks since you can drag-n-drop. But remember, if you can't get Windows to understand the H10, you'll need to go to iRiver's website and download the new drivers. I wish they would give you the drivers beforehand, because some people with computers may not have internet.Overall, if you want the great combination of 20 GB, WMA and MP3, Recording, Drag-N-Drop (no hassle with WMP or Real), and FM radio, you just HAVE to have the H10."

This low-priced pen cleaning kit from Nikon is a must-have. I was surprised that it costs less than non-Nikon cleaning pens that do exactly the same.One end of the pen has a soft brush which is retractable. It's perfect for brushing away dust on the lens. The other end is a cleaning pad, which is used to remove fingerprints and particles that get stuck on the lens. Because this product is small, it doesn't take up any space in the camera bag. It's also very convenient to use.Of course, if your lens surface is really dirty, you should get a complete cleaning system including lens-friendly cleaning solution and soft tissue paper.

[update 1-15-2011] we are upgrading our backbone to managed switches - the latest batch of trendnet TEG160WS units didn't have a fan inside -- infact to make sure I put a wattmeter on it and they only draw 11watts with 8/16 ports in use at 1gbps. My assumtion is they redesigned the product to be more green since it runs 24/7 and were able to yank the noisy fan. You can still replace the fans on the older units with 40mm fans with ball bearings)[end of update]With gigabit ethernet sometimes insufficient to link backbones a common technique has emerged to aggregate to channels to get a 2Gbps link instead. My NAS Raid5 synology arraySynology DiskStation 5-Bay (Diskless) Scalable Network Attached Storage DS1010+ (Black)supports this with 2 gig-e jacks on the back, as do several lan cards on servers these days.The advantage is you can build a backbone between switches that has 2gbps capacity and connect to your server or NAS box with this aggregated 2x speed link, then plug in multiple 1x gig-e devices to the switches along the way. This makes for efficient low cost backbone design and serves the need using off the shelf parts and smart switches like this.The trendnet switch is also a value compared to the cisco 8 port which runs about $100 - 2 of those would cost more than this and you would use 4 ports just linking the two switches together if you use an aggregate backbone design.As for the fan noise - it can be quieted down - the fans that come from the factory are cheap 1u size fans, but computer stores for home pc builders sell high quality ball bearing fans that are the same size but do not make the buzz of the trendnet fans. They have the same hole pattern, voltage, and plug so swapout is easy and quiets down your box without sacrificing airflow. I'll post links when I can find some for sale on amazon so other users can kill off the acoustic noise.one last note - the amazon dimentions are wrong - this is a standard rackmount product measuring 440 x 210 x 44mm (17.3 x 8.3 x 1.73in.)
This unit is identified by its small size (4.5 wide, 7" long, 1" high) and light weight. It has a rounded dark blue case and is powered by the USB port. The Model Number is ZIP250USBPCMBP. It only operates horizontally. This model is treated as a USB Mass Storage Device so you must use Windows Me or later. You should select the icon to "Unplug or Eject Hardware" to remove this device. The IOMEGA software should be installed on Windows 2000. If the unit does not have an eject button on the drive you must select the EJECT command from the Properties menu. It is good to do this all the time because of the disk caching system. The 250 MB drives can read and write to 100 MB ZIP disks, but slower than with a 250 MB disk. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.Remove the disk before turning a computer off. You should never insert a ZIP disk in the drive when the computer is off as this can cause damage. Normally, shutting down the computer causes the disk to eject. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details.Computers have a limited number of IDE devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical. Replaceable 250 MB ZIP disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology. The 250 MB ZIP disk is less widely used than the 100 MB disk. ZIP disks reuse deleted space unlike a CD whose space is consumed when you replace files. Falling prices for CD discs solve that problem. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different Windows systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system."

This ink is great, it can print out high yields. It is a best ink cartridge for me to replace the original canon cartridge. I highly recommend this product.
The Philips DVP642 DVD player has become incredibly popular. I eyed the player for quite a while, before ordering.I've used the player over a month now, and I have the following reactions:The player looks very nice in my A/V rack. I like that it is pretty wide, yet slim.The best part of this player is that it plays just about anything I throw at it. My computer's burned DVD+R, +RW, -R, and even computer burned dual-layer disks all play. Furthermore, almost all the divx and xvid files I've attempted to play, work perfect too!The picture quality is fantastic when connected to my smallish CRT standard-definition TVs. However, the main home for this player is my DLP large-screen television. The picture quality is not too shabby actually. I'm quite happy with it. However, if you do have a large high-definition display you might consider one of the new up-converting DVD players. The picture quality gain is minimal, but a slight edge is there.Furthermore, with this player, I find it is usually best to leave its output interlaced and let my TV do the upscaling rather than use this player in progressive scan mode. The scaling chip in this player obviously can't be very expensive, so it will not do as good as a job as the scaler in many televisions.Overall, I am happy with this player. It does a lot, for the price. The ability to play DVDs, computer burned DVD disks, and disks with divx/xvid files is a great convenience. The picture quality is decent. The remote control lacks any sense, but that is not a big deal. I plan to use it, for at least a while, or until it breaks. Then I will consider an up-converting player, or maybe the high-definition players (blu-ray or HD DVD) will have come down in price by then.
I really love this hard drive. It supports both USB 2.0 high-speed and FireWire IEEE 1394 connections -- a boon to those who have both. (On any given computer, you use either USB 2.0 or IEEE 1394 at a time, not both!) The drive is really fast and quiet. The power adapter is a bit too big, but since it's designed for desktop use -- and it's even stackable -- that's not a big hassle at all.I've had mine for a few months now and it's totally reliable. BTW I have a dozen other Seagate drives (internal and external, from pocketable to big desktop), and all are *very* reliable. As long as you don't drop this or use it as a door stop, it'll last a long time. Of course, always a good idea to have two backup drives. (I use a 300GB and a 200GB, and am planning to get a 1TB RAID drive soon.)The backup software that comes with the drive is decent. I use Retrospect which gives me encryption and other features, but is expensive and may be an overkill for most users. Try the Seagate backup software first; if you want something more powerful, then consider Retrospect.
TDK makes a very reliable blank DVD-R that can handle up to 4.7 GB of data including up to 120 minutes of video with or without sound. Moreover, these blank DVD-Rs are capable of recording data at speeds up to 16x. These are very useful blank discs to record video. Great!The DVD-R discs are compact and easy to store and easy to copy to another blank DVD-R if you need to do that. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your DVD-Rs that have data stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats about any brand of this product: when you burn the data onto the blank DVD-R, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than 16x. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your DVD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the DVD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--and you wouldn't want that, now would you? If you need to label the discs, label its' jewel case using a post-it note.Overall, TDK blank DVD-R discs store data reliably over long periods of time. I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at 16x.

Nikon is the last of the Japanese digital camera makers to come out with an ultra-slim (&lt;= 0.8 inches thin) digital camera, and Nikon has apparently taken many a page from its competitors' playbooks and come out with a deliciously good camera.Before I continue with my review, let me point out that there's a jet black version available (unfortunately not on Amazon yet) which simply looks MUCH better than this silver version. (Remeber, black makes everything look thinner and cooler.) If possible, I recommend you get the black S1. You'll surely impress not only your friends but their grandmas, too.Despite being a small and light -- and pocketable -- camera, the S1 takes surprisingly good pictures. Of course, it's unreasonable to expect the kind of quality you can get on a Nikon D70 SLR or Coolpix 8800 bridge" camera, because these latter models are bigger and therefore have a larger lens (very important for great optical quality) and a larger sensor (important for better color accuracy and lower noise), but I can say that the S1 has the best picture quality in its class, even bettering the great models from Canon (SD400, SD500, etc.) In normal lighting, S1's pictures are sharp and very accurate in color. This latter is very important for getting eye-pleasing photos. Even indoors, the S1 does a decent job; since the lack of light always makes photography difficult, the S1 is better than most. BTW, when indoors, using a camera's built-in flash always results in harsh-looking pictures where the background is dark and ugly. Instead, try mounting the camera on a tripod -- the S1 has a tripod mount -- and taking a picture without the flash. The picture you get will be much more pleasing to the eye.In short, the S1 is a trustworthy performer when it comes to picture quality -- once again, with the necessary caveat that you don't compare this with a D70 d-SLR. I've seen thousands and thousands of digital images, on screen and on paper, and I'm pretty impressed with the S1's image quality. I simply don't think you'll find another ultra-slim camera that can take better pictures than this.Nikon has put in a lot of effort -- and marketing -- in creating in-camera software editing, such as in-camera red-eye reduction and the new D-lighting (which lightens up dark shadows and darkens blown highlights). Both of these can be done during playback, but the red-eye reduction can also take place during shooting: in other words, after a picture is taken, the S1 checks whether there's a red eye problem. If so, it'll automatically fix it (you can set this option).What really amazes me is Nikon's exclusive "face-priority" autofocus (AF) mode when shooting: it can automatically identify the faces in a picture and focus and expose on the closest or centerist face. This is truly AMAZING and works very well -- provided the lighting is not too shabby, or the facial skin tone not too dark. This works especially well in restaurants. You know the drill: you gather your friends at the dining table for a picture, and lo and behold, all too often the camera focuses on the white table cloth in the foreground or that giant Coors neon sign in the back instead of your faces. Nikon S1's face-priority comes to the rescue. The only caveat is, indoors, it doesn't seem to work as well as outdoors when lighting is aplenty.I should also mention the wonders of D-lighting, which I believe is also included in some other Coolpix models. The idea is that after a picture is taken, better lighting effect can be achieved by lightening up shadow (dark) areas and darkening highlight (bright) areas through software post-processing, thus resulting in a better balanced picture. This is what pro photographers do in the darkroom (burning and dodging) or in Photoshop. In fact, every pro picture you see has gone through this process, since almost no picture has teh perfect lighting in its raw film. D-lighting basically lets you do this adjustment in-camera. While it works quite well, my own preference is to turn it off and save the lighting adjustment for later in Photoshop, where I can see a big picture (pun intended) and know exactly which areas need to be fixed. Anyway, for casual photography, D-lighting is a wonderful aid in creating eye-pleasing photos.The S1 does not have an optical viewfinder, so for framing you rely on the 2.5" LCD screen. The screen is bright and covers 97% of the shooting frame, but its 110,000 pixel resolution is only average. This pales in comparison the 230,000 pixel count on the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T7's 2.5" LCD. The Sony's LCD is also brighter, but the Nikon S1's is not shabby at all and compares favorably to the LCD on most ultra-compact cameras.One area in which the S1 does lag market share leaders such as Canon and Casio and Sony is shutter lag. You know, every photographer wants instantaneous picture-taking. The latest models from Canon and Casio are super-fast and have negligible shutter lag, meaning when you press the shutter button, the camera takes the picture in less than half a second -- that includes the time for the camera to focus, take a meter reading and open the shutter. The Nikon S1 has a noticeable shutter lag that will disappoint some buyers. This can be a problem when you demand fast response from the camera, such as when you want to capture those Kodak moments of an energetic baby or child. Many people place a lot of emphasis on shutter lag, so this may be a serious problem for them.There are, however, two solutions. First, you could press the shutter button half-way and hold it there to pre-focus and pre-expose, and when the moment you want arrives, just press the button further down to release the shutter. I'm not saying this to excuse Nikon for not including better shutter lag performance (esp. given the S1's price point), but in general, it's always a good idea to pre-focus, even with a fast digital SLR such as the Canon Digital Rebel XT or Nikon D70. One benefit from pre-focusing is you minimize the handshake when pressing the shutter button, since your finger travels less than from the "up" position. Second solution is use the S1's nice continuous-focus feature which allows you to focus on a moving subject without pressing the shutter button. This continuous-focus (also known as servo AF) feature always keeps the subject in focus, at the expense of battery life and slightly more wear on the focusing motor in the lens.Conclusion regarding shutter lag: if you absolutely demand as little shutter lag as you can get on an ultracompact camera, consider the Canon SD400 or the Casio EX-Z55/Z57. The Fuji Z1 is reportedly very fast, too, although I haven't played with it yet. If you don't mind shutter lag or are willing to use one or both of the solutions outlined above, then you'll love S1 for its other great features (excellent image quality, big LCD, easy interface, ultra-cool styling). My advice: if you don't know much about shutter lag and its implications, check out the S1 and other cameras in a store and pay attention to the time between pressing the shutter button and hearing the "click" sound characteristic of shutter release. My OWN personal preference is I always pre-focus (solution #1) when I need to minimize shutter lag, whether I'm using the S1 or my beloved Nikon D70 d-SLR. (Of course, if you really want fast shooting speed, you'll need to shell out some serious money for a d-SLR such as the Nikon D70.)What else can I say? You get 3x optical zoom (equivalent to 35mm-105mm focal range in 35mm format), a LiIon battery that's about average in performance (the king in this department is the Casio Exilim EX-Z55/Z57 series), and a cradle which you need in order to transfer pictures. (I myself use a USB card reader that takes the SD card.) Speaking of this, the Nikon S1 kit does not come with an SD card, but the camera itself has 12MB of internal memory, which isn't a lot at all.Supposedly the "S" in S1 stands for style, and Nikon has definitely created a very stylish and very desirable ultra-slim digital camera -- especially in the black-body version. But great looks are not the only thing the new S1 has; its picture quality is simply the best in its increasingly crowded class. Finally, you can impress your friends and speed-dating dates with a camera that not only looks good and goes into your pocket, but flatters your subjects as well.Finally, some quick advice: 1) be sure to hold the camera very steady when pressing the shutter; fuzzy pictures from handshaking is the #1 complaint with these tiny cameras; 2) don't let your left hand block the lens; 3) protect the huge LCD screen well; 4) there's a new model called "S2" that's coming out which you might want to investigate before deciding (I personally find the S1 much better-looking)."
This Nikon EN-EL3 clone battery has the same specs as the genuine" Nikon EN-EL3 battery (for D100, D70 and others). Even though it bears the Energizer brand, this is made by an OEM called Technuity which is a licensee of the Energizer brand. The issue is I don't know if Energizer stands behind the quality of this battery, and you are really using it at your own risk. It does get hot after extended use, but so does Nikon's own EN-EL3 (which is likely manufactured by an OEM anyway). This clone does come with a 3-year warranty, but no "equipment warranty," so if it should explode or melt in your Nikon camera, they are not responsible for it.Tip: after charging completes, do not leave the battery charged for more than another hour. Also don't use the camera for a long period of time (my definition is more than 30 minutes non-stop)."

I have used Iomega products for seven years now and have never had any problems with their stability, on both PCs and Macs. (Earlier versions of the Zip disk media were another story, if you know what I mean.) The Predator proves itself to be a solid burner with respectable speeds -- if you've got USB 2.0, that is. Without USB 2.0, the Predator achieves speeds of 4x4x6, which according to Iomega is a limit imposed by the slower USB 1.1. On my workhorse Win2k PC with an USB 2.0 adapter card, I'm not sure if I actually get the maximum speed, but I'm happy with being able to create a 60-minute audio CD in about 5 minutes.The sleekly-built Predator installs easily and quickly and, like most new burners, features buffer underrun technology to prevent writing failures. My previous HP external burner was annoyingly sensitive to buffer underrun, and caused half of all my burns to fail even when the authoring software is the only app running. So far I've experienced a less than 10% failure rate on the Predator. Maybe even less than 5%. And I can actually surf many web sites while burning a CD-R, something I couldn't dream of doing with the HP.The Predator is one fine product and actually looks cool, which is not something to be said of most PC peripherals. Please note that this product does not work on Macintoshes. Win98, WinME, Win2k, and WinXP only.
The price here is a bit too high, and shopping around you'll find deals selling this (5GB) for about one hundred fifty. It's quiet, rugged, and has speed comparable to USB 1.1. So no speed champ, but you can now store personal data on the PC Card and take it with you. Or back up your critical data to it. It's plug-n-play if you have Windows XP. A great gadget to have.
For the past two weeks or so I've been testing out the Philips SHS3200 clip earbuds. The verdict was: return. They were very, very uncomfortable, even if the sound was great it doesn't matter if you can't actually use the headphones. Which means I had to revert ot my Sony pair for a couple of days.I found these on big discount for only...three dollars. I needed this pair pretty desperately, or at least it would suffice until I found something I'd want at a major retailer. The only other time I've bought from Earhugger would be the EH710 over the head headphones which I also rated 4 stars, but someone begged me for those, so I gave them away. They sounded nice and were comfortable and I also remember getting them on discount.For these, I wasn't expecting much, just something that sounds OK and fits well. Which actually IS what you get, except the sound is a bit better than ok. These are the clip earbuds, much like the popular Sony h.ear. They are usual earbuds but have a clip that goes around your ear for more comfort and a more stable fit. That's really all you get, but for three dollars how on earth can you expect extras? It also has a long five foot cord so it won't be awkward walking with these with your iPod or so on in your pocket. I've also noticed that the hook is detachable, so if you just want the buds then you can have that.For sound quality, these don't sound amazing but sound good, especially because for the price I thought these were gonna flat out suck but they're actually pretty darn good. They don't have fantastic deep bass, but they do have a full bass for what they have, making them sound full and rich. Mids sounded good, not overpowering nor are the mids lacking, maybe a bit much in the 200-500k range, but it's not at all bad. These don't have an amazingly clear sound if that's what you're looking for, these did lack in treble a little bit, but again for the price I can't expect stellar sound. I put these on a little music test, and they sounded good on my iPod and CD player but pretty average on iTunes unless I tweaked the equalizer a bit. On my stereo system they sounded fine but best when playing a CD. They sounded good on most of my music collection, and sounded really good on hip-hop, R&B;, dance, spoken word, and light rock. When I turned on hard rock or hard hitting rap it sounded kinda tinny, but were still listenable. I turned on the bass boost on iTunes and my other protable audio sources and handled all and sounded fine, but at higher volumes (more than 80% volume) things started to disort or sound tinny. Overall, not amazing sound, pretty good bass and average elsewhere.These are some darn comfortable headphones to me. When I put them on I did get a good fit automatically but for those who've never tried these types of earbuds before might feel slight discomfort the first week of use or at least it'll feel weird. Just know that if they're uncomfortable from the box you should give them at least two weeks before returning.Something else you should know is that these come with a lifetime warranty! Well, of course there's a catch. You have to send in five dollars for shipping. Relly there's not much worth of the warranty since I found them for three dollars, but if you paid more than five dollars it's probably a good idea to keep the packaging and receipt around.As I said, I only paid three dollars for these at Big Lots, and chances are that's the best price around. For the price you are going to get a comfortable set of clip-buds that'll sound decent and last at least a couple of months, maybe more if you're gentle or using these at home. You'll probably find these from three to eight dollars, paying more for that is a rip-off since you can probably find something better or something with extra bells and whistles like volume control or waterproof features.Overall, not a bad set of headphones. They don't have the same sound as headphones that are more than ten dollars but are comfortable and sound good enough for the price. Good sound, comfortable, and inexpensive, check them out! 4 stars.And in response to earlier review, these don't have a volume control.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The CISCO 7100 I/0 PCMCIA FL-DISK 128MB SPARE, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I have a Epson Stylud C82, and these cartridges outlasted the Epson cartridges that I was using previously, and at a better price.
This inkjet printer is designed for the home or small office. It attaches to a computer via the classic parallel cable or to a USB port. You should connect the USB cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the printer. It can be used with Windows 3.1, 95 via parallel port, or 98, Me, and XP via USB. The black inkjet cartridge is the #15, the tricolor inkjet cartridge is the #17. The #17 tricolor cartridges is often harder to find. This printer works well for the average user. When installing the printer you may have to create a USB Virtual printer port if another printer was previously defined (not for printers connected to a parallel port).HP seems to have a policy of planned obsolescence" in manufacturing new printers that use new inkjet cartridges. Over time it becomes harder to quickly purchase replacement cartridges. If you bought a used printer you can refer to another HP printer manual for general advice. HP advises against refilling a cartridge but you may find doing this useful.The HP840C User's Guide has a Table of Contents that covers the topics in its 74 pages. Be sure to read the warnings in the manual about proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. One user had a problem with the separate power supply. It is probably not good practice to keep the printer powered on when not in use. Like other HP printers the paper path takes a U-turn in printing so the printer uses less desk space."
Mad Dog External 52X CD-RWThis external CD-RW drive connects to any computer that has a USB port. The program supports Windows versions 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, and XP. [There is no support for USB ports in native Windows 95.] This 52X CD-RW is treated like any USB Mass Storage Device.The first steps in the guide explain how to connect the power cord and the USB cable. Turning the power switch on allows the Operating System to recognize the drive. [As with a printer.] If the OS asks for USB Mass Storage Devices" you must install the USB 2.0 driver CD in the internal CD reader. Double click on the "Setup" file, then follow the instructions to complete the driver installation. There is an Unofficial Win98 upgrade that will support USB Mass Storage Devices like a memory stick or an Iomega ZIP drive. If you have done this there is no need to to install the USB 2.0 driver CD.Then install the supplied "Nero Burning Software" CD and follow the on-screen prompts and instructions. You can then run the Nero program to create or update a CD. You should choose the multi-session option when making a copy of your data files to allow future additions or deletions of files; unless you want an archival copy that can't be modified. Nero uses a "drag and drop" method, or you can highlight the folder and file names and choose the "Add" function. When done, choose the "Burn" function to perform the operation. You might choose the options that test the speed and perform a simulation before burning the folders and files to the CD. Then exit the program.This unit is very practical when you have more than one computer and don't want or need a CD-RW drive for each computer, or for space considerations."
I bought the MSAC-US30 Memory Stick reader because it's the one specified in the Sony Playstation Portable (PSP) manual. It's the only reader that's completely compatible with all Memory Stick and Memory Stick Duo media.The term Memory Stick" by itself refers to the original Memory Stick flash memory card made by Sony (and a handful other manufacturers like Lexar, Sandisk and TDK). "Memory Stick Duo" is the second generation of Memory Stick, and it's much smaller than the original Memory Stick. Within each generation (MS and MS Duo), there's the standard media and the "PRO" media, which has faster speeds and is better suited for high-speed video devices, i.e., most of us (including PSP owners) don't need the PRO line of MS or MS Duo. To further complicate things, some Memory Sticks (original or Duo) feature the so-called MagicGate technology, which is a copy-protection scheme used only by Sony.Ok, so this reader is the only one that can read all these Sony-proprietary Memory Stick formats. (The only other USB reader I know of that can read Memory Stick Duo is the Sandisk 12-in-1 reader, but that one has poor quality, slow speed and is not MagicGate compatible.) Which Memory Stick should you get? Here's my take:1) If you plan to store Sony's ATRAC3 or ATRAC3Plus encoded music files (i.e., those ripped from CDs using Sony's SonicStage software, or those bought at Sony's Connect Music Store), you must use a MagicGate Memory Stick.2) If you plan to use flash memory in the latest Sony camcorders or the Playstation Portable (PSP), you must buy a Memory Stick Duo card. (Think of MS Duo as Sony's answer to Secure Digital, whereas the original-sized MS competes with CompactFlash.)3) If you use something that requires high-speed access (e.g., certain Sony digital cameras and camcorders), you should get a Memory Stick or Memory Stick Duo that's PRO-designated.I know this is all very confusing, and it took me a while to figure out. In fact, the story doesn't end here; users of older Memory Stick cards know some of them used two separate memory chips inside a singular MS card. Anyway, e-mail me gadgester @t hotmail if you have any questions."
Wow. iPod. How did we listen to music before it? This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats. MP3, AAC, etc. The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection. It allows fast and easy navigation. The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read. The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind. Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.I use my iPod all the time. You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.The problem with my iPod. The first one I received skipped songs randomly. I had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me. I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved. However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now. Thank you Apple! You make fabulous products. The product I rate five stars, but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow. However, you should still buy an iPod! The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed. Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem. I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.iPod will change the way you enjoy music!
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Crucial 512MB Secure Digital, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

This digital camera has many features. You must read the manual if you never used a camera like this. Page 5 identifies the features. Set the `Mode dial' to AUTO, insert fresh AA batteries (those designed for digital cameras are best), then turn on the `Power button'. Page 12 explains how to set the Date/Time and Languages (any of 22 languages). You should read the pages on using the camera buttons, first those needed to take still photographs. Page 13 explains the `LCD monitor indicator' on this camera. The `Size' and `Quality' affect the size of the file and the number that can fit on the memory card. Pages 53 to 58 explain the `Setup Menu'. You should install the application software before downloading pictures to your PC. If you use Ni-MH rechargeable batteries you must use the `Setup Menu' to identify these batteries.If you choose `1600x1200' for `Size' and `Fine' for `Quality' the photo files will need about 524Kb of file space (two per megabyte). You can delete unwanted photos from memory. The SD memory card can be removed to print selected photos at some stores. If you expect to take many pictures keep extra batteries handy. Batteries too weak for this camera can still be used for flashlights, remote control devices, etc. Always use the top-grade batteries made for digital cameras. If the batteries are weakening an indicator will show less than 3 bars. If the batteries are too weak the camera will shut down, or the screen will just go blank with the lens extended. You must put in fresh batteries to recover and turn the camera on or off. If you should press the lens to one side it can stick and not retract. Gently press the lens toward the center and turn off the camera [this worked for me]. Like other delicate electronic devices, dropping it on a hard surface may cause expensive damage.The installation software requires a Pentium or AMD K6-2 with Windows 98, 98SE, Me, 2000, or XP. To install a memory card first turn off the camera and open the cover. The front of the memory card faces the front of the camera, the pins on the card face the back. Page 5 of the manual explains how to format the memory card before use. This will also delete all photos on the memory card. The manual is adequate but could use more explanations and a larger font. [This manual should be available on an Internet site.]
The L4AX measures exactly 14.1 inches diagonally, about .2 inches more than a 15 CRT monitor, so it works best as a replacement for a 15" CRT. Resolution is standard XGA at 1024x768. I'm never a fan of higher resolution than that so I can live with XGA happily.Mildly stylish, the Kogi seems well built with a sturdy stand. The brightness can't compare with the best from NEC or Sharp, but is adequate in an office or home. Viewing angle is less than more expensive monitors. I don't share my monitor with others so I don't see this as a problem.In real-world usage the monitor performs admirably. The controls are intuitive, and the no-frills design makes it a good value. (Yes, I was attracted to it due to Amazon's good pricing and a generous rebate.)"

A great and economical replacement! This product saved me a lot of money. It worked with no problem.
I saved a ton of money with these cartridges, and the quality was still there.
This is a solid product for a great price. You don't need the accompanying CD-ROM to set it up. In my case, I hooked it up to a Toshiba cable modem and followed the quick start guide to configure the settings. It didn't work right away. A quick call to my cable modem provider revealed that I needed to turn the cable modem off and back on so it can &quot;tolerate&quot; the router.So when you set this up for the first time, be sure to restart both the router and the cable modem after you configure it.
Kodak makes a great portable, single use camera and this two pack works great for people who want them for vacation picture taking and the like! The cameras come in a silvery foil-type wrap which protects them while still keeping it easy to open. The camera needs only to be briefly prepared by winding the wheel at the top of the camera so that the film advances. You can then snap away--you get enough film for 27 pictures per camera! SMILESDespite the fact that these disposable cameras cost so much less than high end 35 mm cameras, they take remarkably good photographs. The quality of the photos may be very slightly less but you sure do save a lot of money if you only need a camera for your two week annual vacation or a special occasion. They come with expiration dates as well, so watch to make sure that you use them before the film gets too old to be of use to you.The built in flash charges quickly once you touch the button on the front of the camera; and after you take a flash picture recharging the flash only takes a very few seconds. The Amazon notes indicate that you don't have to push the button again to recharge the flash; but I always do just to make sure the flash is at its strongest.The 800 speed film gives you even more convenience as it lets you take pictures under a variety of lighting conditions. Talk about convenience!Overall, these cameras are a great choice when you need a camera quick and you are on a budget--and who isn't on a budget nowadays? The film can be developed quickly by major retailers and the picture quality is really rather good.Enjoy!
Update 10/2010 - I wrote this review a long time ago but it's still true today. I moved my 50mm from my E300 to my E3 and still get great portraits from it. I bought the macro empty tube for real closeups and the teleconverter as adjuncts to make this more useful - I don't recommend everyone buys those items unless you are taking forensic pictures in macro mode or want a 200mm 35mm equivalent lens. The tube is cheap because there is no glass inside - it moves the lens out for magnification w/o glass. I just wanted to point out that I've been following this lens price and this month its down lower than the past year (where it approached five bills) so now is a good time to buy at 438 usd. Review begins below.Before purchasing this lens you should read some literature. You don't need to be a lens expert - but know what MTF" means. MTF is modulation transfer function. It is a qualty by which lenses are judged. The more linear the plot, the better the odds you've bought a winner. Olympus and Cannon both publish their MTF plots of their "BETTER" quality lenses. They don't publish the plots of the "included in the box" lenses. For good reason. You can analyze them on a machine if you have a lab and discover they resemble a rollercoaster and not a horizontal line like you would prefer.Google MTF LENS modulation transfer function and you'll be on your way - then visit OLY's website and click on the MTF curves on this lens. You'll see why it is so well thought of.Now let's talk Zoom. Remember your old 35mm camera. If you wanted a closeup, you walked towards the person. A wide angle meant walking backwards, mindful of the pool, traffic, etc. The zoom lens eliminated some of this to the extent of its focal length. This is not a zoom lens. It is called a PRIME lens. PRIME = opposite of ZOOM. It's like that old friend on your first 35mm camera. But with a little under the hood.This is called a macro lens. That does not mean it only can shoot closeups. It will focus from 6" to infinity. For $35 or so you can buy a 3 piece set of magnifiers from Hoya or Tiffen - they screw on like filters but magnify the image in 1, 2, and 4 diopter power. Like using a loupe to view a stone, they help you see the fine detail. The microprinting in the new $20 bill is easy to photograph with this lens. You can see things not visable to the naked eye with it.Finally - as I mentioned the focus does cover close up to infinity like any good lens (just unscrew those magnifiers used to photo your stamp collection). But you will see that while most lenses (in meters) will have a readout of 1, 2, 5, 9, 15, 25, infinity in meters - this lens starts way down at 0.22 m (22 cm!) - the next number is about 0.24 m. The point is there is a wide range of focus space down close to the lens below a meter, then 1, 2, 3 meters. For closeups this can't be beat.This is not to say you can't use this lens like old'faithful on your first 35mm camera. I've shot entire photoshoots with this just stepping back a couple times to frame the shot how I wanted it. I also switch to aperature mode (A) on the Oly Evolt and stopped down the lens to F10 outside or with the FL-50 flash. My depth of field was dramatic - everything came into sharp focus with the crosshairs in the middle.Printing the images on 24" wide photo paper and a HP designjet drafting/photo printer gave the final satisfaction. This is one awesome lens. No zoom, but pictures so sharp and detailed with contrast unheard of before that when I run out to catch a good photo, this lens is normally on my camera. And I also have the 50-200 ED zoom. The 50 ED PRIME lens will outperform the 50 zoom under most occasions.It's a starter lens, a quality lens (mid level in the OLY 3 tier quality system), a macro lens, and best of all a razor sharp lens that maintains contrast (you normally give up one for the other). There is a lot of glass inside this piece, and good glass at that. I advise against the f=35 mm macro lens, as it is in the LOW quality group from oly. If you need a 1:1 scale, consider this lens with the extention tube for a little more and you'll be close to 1:1 there.Like all of the "quality" group of lenses in OLY's lens plan, this has a focus meter on it to tell you where you are focusing, or to aid in manual focusing. Mine spends most of its time on the camera - I'm sure you will enjoy printing photos from it as well. Shoot at F/10 and focus is almost not an issue at all in wide spaces. Inside, add the FL50 flash and shoot F/10 as well. You'll be happy with the outcome.One last note about flashes - you'll eventually want the ring flash for macro work. Undocumented is that the ring flash includes 4 modeling lights with a 3 minute timer on them. To put the macro ring flash on the macro lens requires a ring flash adapter FR-1 available separately for about $95. It's bucks, I realize, but it does have a simple two prong bayonet mount to a ring cut into the lens - so removing the ring flash is a breeze. The ring flash (minus modeling lights) has a GN of 36 and is roughly equivalent to the FL-36, except that shadows are kept to an absolute minimum since the flash wraps around the lens. I use it for closeups and even modeling shots - a great lens/flash combo with the FR-1 adapter. Using the modeling lights you can keep the flash reflection out of the picture!"
This battery has been performing exactly as promised. I now have a spare battery for my camera to give me plenty of recording time. It accurately shows me the available battery charge and I have been getting all the time I need to record my children's constant activities.
I bought this for backup for my Canon IXUS I. Works great! Definitely useful to have for travelling and long photo sessions.
At first I liked this camera and was wowed by its ease of use and 1.8&quot; LCD viewfinder. But after about two weeks of heavy use, I've come to regret my purchase, because the picture quality is just not as good as I first thought.While the pictures have good color balance, they are overly sharpened. In everyday language this means you'll see jagged lines in your pictures, and main subjects (such as people) look as if they stand out from the background in a faux 3D effect. Pictures taken with the DX6440 also tend to be very noisy, even on a sunny day, resulting in lots of video-capture-like artifacts. This is especially true when you look at people's faces on screen. This is quite disappointing.Please note that I'm not saying the pictures taken with this camera are bad. If you get an offbrand product like Argus or Samsung you'll get truly bad pictures. Compared to those the Kodak gives good results. The pictures are acceptable and make nice prints here, but when compared to cameras in teh same price and megapixel class from Canon, Casio, Fuji, Konica Minolta, Nikon, and Sony, the DX6400 cannot hold a candle in terms of picture quality, period.Ultimately this is a point-and-shoot digital camera. You turn the dial to Auto mode and just snap away. There is a semi-manual mode called PAS (&quot;program, aperture priority, shutter priority&quot;) that offers limited manual controls. You cannot, for example, set both aperture and shutter, so pro photographers shouldn't buy this camera. Also, you'll have to turn the (flimsy) mode dial all the way around to get to the PAS mode, thus discouraging even a semi-serious photographer like myself who enjoys setting manual settings.The best feature on this camera is probably its 4x optical zoom, and zooming in and out is pretty fast. The lens is supposedly designed by a top German optical company, so it's too bad that the digital signal processing circuitry inside the camera does not retain images in top-notch quality.Some annoying cons/quirks are:- No case is included. This is the most disappointing aspect of the package. They give you a dock and two special batteries (one chargable included with the dock, the other non-chargeable included with the camera itself), but no case. Not even a cheap one. Kodak, why???- No independent playback mode. By this I mean you have to turn on the entire camera in order to play back pictures. It's plain silly to let the lens mechanism go to work if the user just wants to review a picture or two. This is part of what I meant earlier by the smart engineer/dumb interface designer thing. Kodak: take a look at Canon's products.- As mentioned before, the mode dial is just a stupid interface idea.- You operate the camera with your right hand, but the interface controller (a joystick) is operated with your left hand. Kinda awkward. Make that very awkward.- You cannot set compression level. You can only set the resolution (4, 3.5, 2 and 1). It would have been nice to be able to set compression level. (Of course, I'd have set it to the lowest compression anyway.)- Internal memory (16MB) and flash memory card are not treated as one integrated unit. Get this: when you are using the memory card, you cannot even review pictures in internal memory, unless you manually set storage mode to internal memory. But then, you won't be able to review pictures on the memory card. Again, very dumb.Ok, summary time. The quirks I listed above mean I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this camera. This comes as an ultimate disappointment to me because I always wanted to buy (and keep) an American-brand digicam. (HP digital cameras suck, period.) The Kodak's picture quality is disappointing with video-capture-like artifacts. The camera is very easy to use, but in the end, you'll be better served by excellent offerings from Canon, Casio, Fujifilm, Nikon, and Sony. Take a look at Canon S410 (4MP) or the Casio QV-R51 (5MP); both have top-notch picture quality.
just received my armband for my iPod NANO. It is really lightweight, comfortable and easy to adjust.. Would buy again.
These CD-Rs are golden--both literally and figuratively! The quality of the sound I record onto them is a perfect copy of the sound from the source CD-R. Moreover, how can you beat a 300 year life expectancy? They'll survive longer than I will!On the very bright side, these are manufactured with what Amazon notes is phthalocyanine, the best organic dye currently available." Awesome! It is scratch and fingerprint resistant, too--I tested it!On the down side, once in a while these CD-Rs can be fussy about which recording equipment they'll work with. However, they will work with the average PC and CD player. The packaging could be better, too: they arrive merely in the clear plastic wrap surrounded by bubble wrap so they don't get bumped around in transit. For the price you pay they ought to come in a protective cylinder shaped plastic shell!All in all, however, these CD-Rs are excellent for data and audio storage. I highly recommend them as very attractive alternatives to standard, run of the mill store brand CD-R blank media. They are especially resilient against fingerprints and scratches; and their life expectancy just can't be beat! Awesome! SMILES"
I bought this cable for my computer at office in order to conntect my new portable speaker as my computer do not include the speaker for me. This cable is retractable, there is no tangled cable. 'm highly recommened this cable.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Edge 64MB CompactFlash Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
It is with high quality and more than that, is at a great price.I use this to charge my ipod while driving. It is powerful enough to keep it well-charged throughout the trip.
I used this brand of single use camera recently and the pictures came out fairly well. Oh, sure, the quality of the pictures won't be 100% as good as the pictures you would get from a digital camera or a standard, more expensive 35 mm camera. Actually, the pictures these Fuji cameras take are slightly grainier than the Kodak single use cameras. Sigh.However, the camera is very lightweight so you can carry several at a time in a bag as you travel. I especially like the built in flash that is easy to use. According to Amazon, the flash range is about 10 feet. I think that's about right.The camera is a single use camera; this means that after you use it you take the entire camera to the place where you can get film developed; they will take care of the rest. No worrying about whether or not you removed the roll of film negatives correctly without exposing them to too much light. The film speed is 400, so keep that in mind when choosing this camera. A faster speed such as 800 may be preferable.Overall, this is a good camera for the many, many people who want to travel light or who are on a budget. It is compact and easy to carry; keep one in the glove compartment of your car just in case there's an accident and you need to take pictures of the scene. The camera is also affordable. I give it four stars instead of five simply because the picture quality just isn't the best.

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SimpleTech STI-ATAFL/128 128MB ATA Flash PC Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

The Mac Mini was released in January 2005 at Mac World, and was then updated, for the first time, in July 2005. This Mac Mini is the result of that update.Improvements - The $499 Mac Mini now sports 512 MB of DDR SDRAM, which is twice the memory the original Mac Mini included. This is a significant upgrade. The majority of users can now buy, out of the box, a machine that performs beautifully and allows a fair amount of multi-tasking. The Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger, thrives on memory, and 512 MB helps to create a speedy experience, for users.Besides the memory, the hardware on $499 Mac Mini has not changed, from the early-2005 version.The Good Things that Continue to Shine with Mac Mini - A buyer of the Mac Mini will continue to enjoy Mac OS X Tiger, which is the best consumer operating system in the world. It works with the hardware beautifully to provide a simple, fast, elegant, and reliable experience. One of the favorite descriptions of Mac fans, to describe Macs, is simply, it just works."The Mac Mini continues to include iLife '05, with great applications such as iPhoto, iMovie HD, iDVD, iTunes, and Garageband. These are all included, with every Mac Mini. You will be challenged to find any PC that includes applications that come anywhere close to the iLife suite. Manage thousands of your digital images in iPhoto, create home movies in iMovie, and create professional music in Garageband.Appleworks is included for simply word processing, spreadsheets, etc., but you might want to pick up Microsoft Office for Mac. A student/teacher edition is available, for just over $100.Speed - The 1.25 GHZ PowerPC G4 processor makes the Mac Mini a very capable machine.Hard Drive - 40 GB will probably be significant for a lot of people. You can enjoy a few thousand photos and songs with 40 GBs, plus lots of text files, but very little video. However, if you'd like to double the hard drive, pick up the $599 Mac Mini.ComboDrive - The Apple Combo Drive allows you to burn music and data CDs, plus you can watch DVDs!Drawbacks? The $499 Mac Mini does not include the wireless functions included, with the $599 and $699 Mac Mini. You will need USB keyboard & mouse, PC USB keyboards/mouses will work. Furthermore, you will need to connect to the internet via either dial-up on the internal modem, or via DSL/cable modem, which can connect to the ethernet port on the back of the Mac Mini.Best value of the Mac Minis? The $499 Mac Mini is the cheapest way to get your hands on a Mac, and it is a very capable machine. However, the $599 model offers a lot of upgrades, for the extra $100.Overall, Apple has created another fantastic product, with the Mac Mini, and the July 2005 update only made it better. You get more memory, for the same price. This Mac Mini really includes everything the average user needs to enjoy the internet, manage his or her digital life, and have fun doing it all."
I boought this item for my friend. She likes it much as she can share her music with her boy friend.
This 1GB player's list price is only 59.95. I can't believe Ace Digital charges almost twice as much. It's a good flash MP3 player that looks stylish and plays forever on one AA battery.
Stylish and with great sound, this is a perfect portable CD player for everyday use. The included headphones are merely ok, and the MP3 functions are not very powerful, but this player has lots of good features and is a terrific value. Excellent quality, too.
Update: One reviewer on Amazon points out to take advantage of the wide-screen capability properly, you need to go into Set Up from the remote control and set the screen size to Wide Screen.*****After searching and waiting for a year, I finally took the plunge and bought a portable DVD player. I could wait no longer as I'm having trouble falling asleep these days. I chose the DVD-1810, which is also marketed under the US Logic (by CompUSA), Initial Technology and Shinsonic brandnames. It's made by Huake Electronics in China. They also make other screen sizes (5.8, 6, 6.8, and 7). I also read on the web that a 10-inch and an 11-inch models are on the way.I picked this model for its 8-inch gorgeous screen and unbeatable price. It even comes with a car adapter as well as AC cables (RCA type). The screen is very good, has wide-screen, and the battery lasts about 2 hours on high brightness. BTW, the machine itself is a little over an inch thick, but the battery snaps to the bottom and will add another half an inch. The whole thing (player + battery) weighs in at about 2 pounds... You can use the brick-style AC adapter with the player directly if you don't need the battery (e.g., when watching movies indoors). Battery charging takes about 6 hours, so that's a department where Huake can improve.The player has simulated surround sound, but you should get a good pair of headphones to take full advantage of that. (Hint: any good Sony headphones will make a great addition. The player does not come with headphones.) All the other standard DVD features are there, and you can also zoom in and zoom out. Zooming in, however, results in pixelated images, so it's not really too useful, but some may find it of value. The package also includes a full-function DVD remote that's powered by a watch battery.I'm very happy with my DVD-1810 and take it everywhere I go. I just need to recharge it every night. I highly recommend this tremendous value if you are in the market for a portable DVD player. Also, if you want to see the player up close, check it out at CompUSA (ask for US Logic portable DVD players).
I saw this at my local Staples but then found it for only $209 on Iomega's website (still available at this price; look for item#33149). It required no setup on my Windows XP systems; pure plug-n-play. So far it's been great. It's really small, and the best thing is, it requires no external power or batteries. It's powered entirely from the USB port -- this does mean that you should not use this on an unpowered USB port (e.g., some cheap USB hubs sold at Radio Shack).This drive, at 4200rpm (and probably equipped with a small buffer), is no speed champ, hence I'm not giving it 5 stars. Like most USB 2.0 storage devices, its speed maxes out around 10MB/sec, far below the 48MB/sec theoretical max speed of USB 2.0 High-Speed specification. Also, the long-term reliability of this gizmo is unknown. I previously owned Archos and Iogear's mini hard drives and both broke down after just a year of moderate use. The Iomega Mini does look more solid than the other two, but occasionally when I plug it into the USB port, it makes some clanking noise, so that's a bit unnerving. I hope it holds up over time...At this point, I'm pretty happy with the product. It's just so convenient to carry a compact, lightweight (3.5 oz.) hard drive that requires no batteries or AC adapter. Plus, it comes with a leather carrying pouch.
I bought this for my avchd camera in places where a large tripod just would not go (cruise ship) and it worked perfectly. The attention to design detail here is great:1 - feet are beveled to keep it level on a flat surface2 - all 3 legs extend (amazing in a tripod so small)3 - sturdy - enough to hold much more weight4 - lens allignment stud compresses when used with non-camera gear like audio systems5 - Best for last - small enough to get onboard a flight with a TSA agent soing through your bag of gear. I had another small tripod like this that folded 3 different sized legs together - that one looked like a gun in x-ray and got my bag open every time - with this, all legs are equal and it looks like a tripod - goes through xray without a hitch.Would I change anything? no. It's fine the way it is. I even used it to secure my marantz PMD-661 recorder on a helicopter flight with the seatbelt of the next seat over. The PMD-661 has a tripod mount underneath and with this I made a secure position that allowed me to see the vu meters during flight.
Synergy Digital Charger with Four AA BatteriesThis charger with its four AA NiMH 2800mAh rechargeable batteries is very useful for any high drain digital camera. You may have to reset the camera to use NiMH batteries instead of the more usual alkaline batteries. You can also use it to charge AAA batteries (used in some cameras).Remember to remove the plastic covering on each battery before charging. It can take 4 to 6 hours with a new battery. The batteries are charged in pairs, two on the left and two on the right. You will see a red light when it is charging. It turns to green when the battery is charged. You should carry a spare set so your photography can continue when the batteries are low.There is a plug to allow this unit to be used on a 240v line (common in Europe and other countries).
The DiamondPoint series of LCDs are sold under the Mitsubishi brand primarily to corporate users. We have one here in the office and compared to my office NEC MultiSync LCD1760V, it looks and feels substantially more solid. The image quality is excellent, and it's also in the same stylish black thin-frame enclosure as the LCD1760V. Pure plug-n-play, the NXM76LCD-BK gives you a full 17 inches in diagonal viewable area (13.3 x 10.6"). The max resolution is 1280x1024.In the end, I think the two LCDs are pretty much identical and both excellent. Just pick the one that's cheaper."
The PCV-W20 is one awesome integrated desktop. Sure it's pricey, but you get a lot of features plus Sony's award-winning styling. The widescreen 15.3 (measured diagonally) LCD is beautiful and has excellent contrast ratio. The CPU is actually 1.8Ghz, not 1.9 (which doesn't exist), but it's still fast. Sony apparently optimizes the system so it feels as speedy as a 2.4Ghz Dell Dimension 2350 or 4500.Unlike most other one-piece PCs, this one has all the ports loaded: three USB 2.0 ports (but one already taken by the optical mouse), two 4-pin i.Link/IEEE 1394 ports, one line-in port for hooking up an audio input source (e.g., a portable CD player or MP3 player), two PC Card slots, and one Memory Stick slot. Modem and ethernet are built-in, so you can surf web either way you want. You also get a DVD-ROM/CD-RW combo drive, but no DVD burner.The W-series is really designed for family users who don't need to tinker with the system, so the biggest downside for us geeks is that you can't expand the system easily. For example, you can't put in a bigger hard disk, although you can get an external USB 2 or IEEE 1394 hard disk, or use an IDE hard disk with an external enclosure kit (e.g., ADS Pyro). You also can't upgrade the graphics card, which means if you are into the latest 3D games, you are out of luck. And you can't put in an internal DVD burner; instead you'll need to get an expensive external one (usually at a one-hundrd dolr premium).Specs aside, the W20 is a pleasure to use. The keyboard does suffer from Sony's annoying policy of doing away with the insert/home/delete/... keys, and the arrow keys are cramped with the main keyboard which makes them hard to use. But that's about the only gripe. As mentioned before the system is speedy, and Sony bundles the system with a generous offering of software titles. The user experience is very positive, so if you can afford it, this is a highly recommend system for your home."
The Crosley Stack-O-Matic replacement needle really comes in handy when you're worn out that old needle on your Crosley Stack-O-Matic" phonograph! Now of course I'm showing my age here by reviewing a phonograph needle; but hey, I still like the sound of vinyl record albums when I listen to my music.The needle replacement instructions are very clear on the reverse of the package that you get in the mail when you order the needle. The plastic and thin cardboard package looks exactly like the one pictured above on this webpage. In addition, the replacement needle comes well packed in a bubble wrapped envelope; that's good for when the post office plays soccer with the package as it's en route to your home.One note, however: this needle will only be useful for the Crosley brand "Stack-O-Matic" record players. It is not at all recommended for use on other brands of turntables or other brands of record players--it may not fit or it could break or even do damage to the turntable arm or your records.Although Crosley recommends that you change needles every 1,000 hours of playing time, there are instances in which you will need a replacement needle much, much sooner than this. In my case, I recently wanted to play a record; but the tiny little hole in the middle of the record was just a tad too wide; and therefore the record didn't drop down onto the turntable! When the turntable arm and its needle fell onto the solid surface near the turntable, the needle consequently became slightly damaged. If this happens, the current needle will still play your records but it could easily do damage to the grooves on the records in the longer run; get a replacement needle and install it like I did.Score a huge goal for Crosley with their "Stack-O-Matic" replacement phonograph needle. Grab an extra needle if you want to make sure you always have an extra one on hand--and listen to some tunes TODAY!"
I'll confess - I needed a mic pre-amp and didn't have a big budget. This seemed like I couldn't go wrong so I bought it.So far I'm impressed with the sound quality, features, build, and value of this low end tube preamp.First, it has both 1/4 and XLR inputs and outputs, with no switches needed (both work all the time). The VU meter is backlit and features an overdrive LED as well as a limiter circuit as well as input gain and output level controls.This unit has performed well so far - I ran it constantly for the first 48 hours to weed out any early problems and none appeared. The box gets a little warm in constant usage, but not objectionably so. Some is from the meter light and some from the tube heater.If I ran into the need to go from mic --> line level again I'd buy this amp again. It's nice to be surprised with the quality and features instead of disappointed with snap together plastic stuff that eats 9V batteries every day.This was definitely a case of the wallet talking and making the right decision."
I don't own the Apple Nano. My friend does and I used it enough to write an Amazon review about it.Sound Quality: The sound quality was not as good as on my iRiver (my i had more clarity and a little more bass response), but the difference isn't even noticeable unless your obsessive-compuslive about sound. There is a custom EQ along with some presets to match what genre of music you like. I've never seen the Apple earbuds but most people say they are awful so you should probably pick up some better earbuds or headphones (the ones I have are the Panasonic RPHJE50's and my friend's are the cheaper Sony MDRJ10's if that helps you on your search).Interface: Well, I must say I'm impressed. I will say that it's much easier to use than most MP3 players on the market (the iPod's interface is really the whole reason they are so popular). The artists, albums, genres, and titles are set up like most, in category forms so you can find your song. Note that 500 songs (128 kbps, trust me don't go any lower) is around 40 albums, so I would recommend stepping up to the 4 GB Nano which will hold 1,000 songs/80 albums. The software the Nano uses is iTunes (which most people are familiar with). It does pretty much any function Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or MusicMatch would do. It's easy to create playlists on iTunes and send them into your player.Features: The Apple Nano has some features, even though it's somewhat lacking. One of the best features is it's size. This thing is small, only 3.5 x 1.6 x 0.27 inches and only weighs 1.5 ounces. The player does display album art, most MP3 players will not do that. It has a nice 1.5-inch color display and a photo viewer. It works with most OSs, even my friend got it to work on Windows 98. Some websites will podcast and you can put casts on your Nano. The Nano has some nice features, however, some of the features are lacking. The battery life is only 14 hours while most MP3 players are more than this. It charges and syncs with one USB, which means you have to take both along if you have to charge it. Hopefully your computer has a USB port in the front like me, that way you won't have much of a hassle. There is no FM tuner/recording but most people don't need that feature, however I think it should be deserved for the high cost.Durability: The durability is much better than an iPod. I've heard batterys are fine on the Nano unlike iPods. It seems pretty durable, though I would highly recommend getting a case AND a rubber thing for it for two reasons. 1) It scratches very easily, both the plastic and the LCD. 2) The Nano will probably break if you drop it on concrete or the road.Price: Just in my opinion, the price is way too high for just a 4 GB MP3 player. I think Apple is just asking for too much. I know it's small, but that still doesn't balance the price.Overall: The Apple 4 GB Nano is a treat anyone would enjoy. Though the price is high and it doesn't have a radio or a record feature, it's good because of its size and its ease of use. 4 stars.
I can't say enough good things about the iP4000 printer. I myself have the lesser iP3000 model, but my neighbor has the iP4000 and it's faster and sports even better color management than the already excllent iP3000. The added color tank increases the color accuracy and vibrance" in photos -- but makes no difference for priting text and simple graphics. Still, the small premium over the iP3000 model is worth it, as the iP4000 is also noticeably faster.But, alas, Amazon has started charging $20 for ground shipping! This is ridiculous, as they used to make this eligible for free "supersaver" shipping. (I think Amazon has just started rolling back on free shipping, as many products are now no longer eligible.) You can find better price and/or free or cheaper shipping elsewhere, such as Tigerdirect."
This TV wrist watch is more like a wrist TV with a rudimentary time/date piece at the top. The TFT active matrix color (that's right, color!) screen measures about 1.5 diagonal. There's no speaker on the "watch"; instead, you listen in via the included special earphones. The earphones are special because the cord also acts as the TV antenna, so in order to watch TV on this thing, you must use the included earphones.I got mine from a website called shentech dot com. (I'm *not* affiliated with them in any way.) Just sixty nine bucks only! You should know that NHJ went bankrupt last year, that's why the TV watch is on clearance now. What a pity. It's so cool...Yeah, it's really cool to be able to watch TV on a watch. The TV runs off a built-in LiIon rechargable battery which can last over an hour, probably close to two hours. Recharging the battery takes around 90 minutes when connected to the AC. You can also recharge the battery using four AA batteries; or you can power the TV using AC or four AA alkaline batteries.The TV watch really comes in two pieces: the TV unit, and an ugly plastic base with wrist strap attached. But NHJ also includes a neckstrap, very thoughtful of them, as watching TV on your wrist can get tiring.The problem is, reception is just not that good. No, you can't hook up cable or a DVD to this. You just have to live with over-the-air (OTA) broadcast signals. The earphone-antenna is rather weak in picking up the signals. It helps if you are situated close to the TV broadcast towers or live on high floors. The reception is also very direction-dependent, and sometimes if you hold the earphone cord in your hand it may help. Overall, the reception on the TV is quite disappointing, but works if you are willing to experiment with different positions.The TV tuner can tune in to channels 1 to 64, but due to the reception limitation, you proably will just get a few channels to look acceptable. For me, the Jerry Springer channel appears the best, so I can watch 2 hours of Jerry Springer on my wrist every day. Not bad.Anyway, this is absolutely the coolest gadget in the world, and the price is really great. Just don't expect warranty repairs if yours breaks."
I took off one star for a couple reasons really. First I object to shipping a product with crippled" toner / ink or consumables. These things are expensive and end up in the landfill making more waste. Many companies have adopted the policy of cheapest selling price, expensive supplies, and a "starter" cartridge which will get another $100 out of you within weeks of use.Secondly, the unit lacks a network interface. Today, all office printers should be on the network to be shared amongst employees. Here both the printer and fax could be shared! I end up putting "networkless" devices on HP's network adapters that allow them to become a networked device.Other than that, its your typical fax printer. I do like the small footprint on the desk. Every resource is scarce in some way - a network fax would be nice to have. Deskspace is scarce too. Fortunately the printer does not have substantial power surges like some older equipment.I like it overall after putting it on the network."
The RF-11 assembly is designed to take advantage of the bayonet mount found on all 67 mm filter assemblies and the FR-1 adapter tube for the 50mm macro lens (the FR-1 forms an extention tube in front of the lens to protect the full focus extension and has the 67 mm filter thread needed for the TF-22 and also the 67mm bayonet system needed for the RF-11)I have no idea why amazon says it needs the SR-1. The SR-1 is ONLY for the TF-22, in fact they say the TF-22 needs the SR-1 - the TF-22 SHIPS with the SR-1. Amazon needs to correct this error because the SR-1 is hard to find anywhere!. It also doesn't need the FR-1 unless you have the 50mm macro lens.The RF11 will lock onto the 14-54 and the 50-200 mm lenses with just a 30 degree twist to engage the bayonets that normally hold the lens hood. As for a flash, it's as powerful as any GN36, but exceptionally parallel to the lens, with no shadow cast by the lens as with flashes mounted above the lens.For greater light control, the GN22 TF-22 twin flash should be used in extreme cases (and it DOES come with the SR-1 to hold the two flashes - see my reviews on theOlympus TF-22 Twin Flash Head (Needs FC-01 Flash Controller, FR-1 & SR-1)for more info there)Most people will want the ring flash first, and then get to the twin flash when their needs dictate. The extra light from the ring flash makes for some great portrait shots. As with the twin flash, the ring flash has 4 modeling lights in the corners to aid in locating the flash reflection in your composition before shooting. They also come on automatically for focus if you have the AF set to use the modeling lights.This is a specialized flash that can be used out to about 6 meters or so - beyond that I would switch to the FL-50. It can be used down to 6 inches and below that I would switch to the TF-22.One last thing - exposure adjustment is no longer done with the +/- key on the camera when using the lens mounted flashes. TheOlympus FC-01 Macro Flash Controller (for use with TF-22 & RF-11 Flash Heads)has on it a dial for +/- 3 EV stops that controls the flashes directly. The camera exposure control is not active when using these flashes.All together the flash system is very well designed as the high voltage power supplies work with any flash (the FL-50 and FC-01 are in the same body and accept the FP-1 and SHV-01 power supplies). For close up works they can't be beat.
The Visor is basically the 2 MB version of the Visor Deluxe.All Handspring models run variations of the Palm operating system, and have all of the PALM functions people havecome to know and love -- calendar, addresses, to-do lists, and access to a variety of downloadable programs.However, the 2 MB of memory doesn't go far when you want to take advantage of some of the more interesting programs, such as Avantgo (a free service thatallows you to download publications like the New York Times, CNN, Sports Illustrated onto your Palm for free) or street maps from Mapopolis.com or Vindigo, a city guide that gives restaurant and movie reviews and showtimes. You can fit one, maybe even too such problems onto your Handspring. But pretty soon you are running up against that memory barrier. That would be extremely frustrating for me (I have the Deluxe, a friend has the Visor 2MB and recently upgraded to a higher end model in part because he wanted to add more programs...If you do that, in the end buying the low end model will actually cost you money).The Handspring models have the best features for the money. They have a noticeably larger screen than the m100 and m105 (which Ireturned after a week), expandability (which I have yet to use, although I long for the GPS attachment from Magellan --maybe when it goes on clearance?)These models only get four stars, however, because they do have two significant shortcomings.One is bulk. The Visor, Deluxe and Neo are significantly larger than the Palm V, which is significantly more expensive.The PDA still fits in my chest pocket, though. (I don't recommend you do that...today mine fell out of my pocked and the screen cracked. I called Handspring and they are sending me a replacement for $85 -- Argh).Also, unlike the Palm V, 500 and 505, the Visor, Deluxe and Neo require new batteries after about two weeks of relatively heavyusage. That can amount to $20 a year or so on batteries alone. The Palm V has a lithium rechargeable, and the new Palm500 has an even better battery, but I can't justify paying that kind of money for what is still basically, at heart, anappointment calendar.Also, since this is the ultra-low end model, keep in mind that you need to have a computer to back up your data and to download features to your Visor. Note that the Visors come with fast USB hotsyncs -- which come on all new computers made in the last few years, while the Palm M105 and m100 come with seerial hotsyncs (slower, but almost every computer ever made has a serial port). Palm and Handspring charge you extra if you want the other type of hotsync, so that my influence your decision as well.BTW, I am a newspaper reporter who previously had four Rolodexes on my desk. No longer. No longer do I misplace names, numbers, or dates. I also don't get lost as often with Mapopolis at my side. This thing has changed and organized my life in ways I didn't expect -- just ask my wife.It's basically an extension of your brain -- now isn't that worth a couple hundred smackers?
Without question, I love Macintosh computers. The ease of use, performance, and design that is Apple makes me productive, keeps the headaches down, and makes working on a computer fun.Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch. That all changed in January 2006, with the introduction of Intel processors inside Macintosh computers.Processor in the new Mac MiniThis particular Mac Mini features an intel Core Solo processor, which is the little brother to the Core Duo processor. The Solo performs strongly, in everyday computing tasks: browsing your photos in iPhoto, using the Internet, sending email, listening to music in iTunes, etc. In fact, the Solo is a very strong processor. There is certainly a significant increase in performance over the G4, which was previously included with the Mac Mini. The performance increase is noticeable in everyday tasks. I was impressed. The Mac Mini Core Solo also packs enough punch that I was able to play 720p high definition video, but 1080p was a bit too much for it to handle. Nevertheless, the G4 could not play 720p smoothly, which so the strong step-up with this machine.Design - The Mac Mini is beautiful. I just love looking at this computer. One of the most beautiful computer form factors ever. You will immediately notice how nicely Apple packages the computer, in an impossibly small box. It may be a small form factor, but it has a lot of features. There are plenty of ports too: 4 USB 2.0 ports, 1 Firewire 400 port, DVI Video out, Audio In, Audio Out.Video Card -The new Mac Mini has Intel integrated graphics, which isn't usually a great feature. However, it is still a step-up from the graphics on the previous Mac Mini. The graphics on this machine supports Core Image technology, which the previous Mini did not. It does share your system's memory, for video memory, which is even more of a reason why you should upgrade this system's memory.Video - The Mac Mini includes a DVI-output connector on the back, which can also output VGA, with the included adapter. An analog video out adapter is also available, separately. The DVI and VGA connectors will allow you to connect the Mini to virtually any display.Memory - The Mac Mini has a very capable processor, but you may not realize its full potential with the limited memory in the machine, 512 MB. Consider upgrading your memory, once your machine arrives. Other World Computing and Crucial are two companies that sale memory, with online selector tools to easily find the right kind.Applications -Apple does include iLife '06, which has iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and Garageband. There is the Safari web browser, some board games, the always useful iCal, AddressBook, iChat, etc. Overall, I was pleased with the included software.iLife 06 is particularly great. I love the new full-screen photo editing, photo comparing, etc. You can now also order calendars and greeting cards made with your photos, direct from Apple, by using the iPhoto software. iMovie has new themes, which helps make professional-looking home movies, and iDVD now supports widescreen DVDs. iWeb is a brand-new applications, which makes it easy to create professional quality webpages, quickly. I can't wait to rebuild by site using iWeb. Apple continues to make it easy to create music, manage your digital images, make movies, and create web sites. It is important to note this Mac Mini does not include a DVD burner, so the usability of iDVD will not be there, unless you buy an external DVD burner.A trial (30 day) of iWork '06 is also included, which includes the page layout program Pages, and the presentation program Keynote (which makes presentations that blow away presentations made by rival PowerPoint).Hard Drive-This Mac Mini supports a 60 GB hard drive, which will be sufficient for a lot of people. You can certainly hold a lot of documents and music on it. However, you won't fit much video.Combo Drive -The Combo Drive in this Mac Mini will allow you to burn music and data CDs, plus watch DVDs. However, you will not be able to burn DVDs.PowerPC Applications on Intel MachineIf you own a lot of software for Mac, then most of it is probably compiled for PowerPC. Developers are working hard to make titles run natively on both Intel and PowerPC, but many titles are not yet ready. However, many titles you can use on an Intel Mac because Apple has included Rosetta, which translates the PowerPC code into something the Intel machine can read. However, you never see Rosetta for it works quietly in the background and makes running PowerPC applications seamless. Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta. Intensive applications such as Photoshop will run under Rosetta, but it will be slower until Adobe has an Intel compiled version of Photoshop. Rosetta does work and if you add memory to your Mac, Rosetta works even better.Two titles I use EyeTV and Toast 7 are not yet compiled for Intel, but they run fine on my Intel Mac, under Rosetta. Again, you don't have to open anything special to use Rosetta. Your Mac knows when it needs it and uses it.Wireless - This Mac Mini includes bluetooth and Airport wireless technologies, standard. Connect wireless keyboards, mice with Bluetooth, and log-onto the Internet with Airport.Overall, I am very happy with the Mac Mini Core Solo. It should perhaps come with more memory standard, but it is a very impressive machine. It is incredibly fast on Intel-native applications, and it does a very good job running PowerPC applications. The Intel machines are the future of Apple, so there is no question this is a good machine, and this one has enough power to get most tasks completed in a very speedy manner. I'm happy with my Intel Mac, and I look forward to continue exploring it in the coming days
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk 64MB SmartMedia Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
IOMEGA ZIP 100 InternalThis internal ATAPI drive is the fastest access to a replaceable ZIP 100 disk compared to a drive that connects to the parallel port, even when the Parallel Port Accelerator program is used to optimize data transfer. The external drive that uses a USB connection is the next best thing. The `User's Manual' recommends watching the Video Tutorial before installing the hardware. Read the instructions and take notes if you never did this before. The ZIP drive is always installed on the secondary IDE channel, never the same IDE channel used for the hard drive. The CD drive is usually the master or first drive, the ZIP drive should be the secondary or slave drive. Installing an internal drive requires more knowledge than with an external drive, whether USB or parallel port. A 100 MB disk can contain about ten thousand 10KB files, or a thousand 100KB files.NEVER insert a ZIP disk into a drive unless the power is on, as this can damage the drive. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole in the back (p.26). CD drives have their emergency eject hole on the front panel, a better location. Once the drive is installed correctly turn on power and then you can install the IomegaWare software from the CD. Follow the instructions on the screen. Use the applications to format, copy, and protect your ZIP disks. Or you can download the software from the Iomega web site. Use the Copy Machine application to duplicate a ZIP disk (p.28). You can format a ZIP disk with the Iomega Format, or run applications from a ZIP disk (p.29). You can both Read and Write Protect your ZIP disks (p.30). The three jumper settings are explained on pages 32 and 33. The last section is for Troubleshooting and has answers for possible problems.Iomega recommends installing IomegaWare applications in Windows 2000 to format ZIP disks so they will be compatible with other Windows operating systems. If a ZIP disk is formatted in NTFS it can lock the disk so the eject button on the device does not work. You should always choose the software eject command because of disk caching in Windows 2000 and XP. The ZIP 100 disk provides unlimited storage space within its 100 MB limit. Space on a ZIP drive is reused when files are replaced or deleted. Only a ZIP 100 drive can do a Long Format on a ZIP 100 disk. This can correct disk errors or remove protection from files. The 250MB drive can read and write 100MB disks, the 750MB drive can only read 100MB disks. The 100MB drive can not process the larger capacity disks.This Z100ATAPI model comes in a 5.25 bracket, four bolts, spare jumper, IDE cable, and a power cable connector. The drive can also fit in a 3.5" bay. The 100MB disk is practical in downloading software from the Internet to take home, or other large files for transportation. But newer computers no longer include a ZIP 100 internal drive as an option."

I bought this on the bet that a standard 72mm pinch-type cap for nikon would work on an olympus lens with a UV filer just the same. Sure 'nuf it does.So all you Olympus guys out there head over here if you are buying the high end lenses for a pinch type cap from our friends at nikon. It's easier to get off and on than the onlympus stock cap.Now back to your regularly scheduled nikon programming....
I just can't get over the capacitor trend. I thought 1 F was enough - now they are making 50F caps that resemble car batteries. Do you need it - well, maybe if you are seriously into car audio competition, but this 1.0 (actually the product that shipped was 1.5 Farads) cap is rated for amps to 1000W.Why use a cap? A capacitor stores a tremendous amount of energy that can be delivered very quickly to your amplifier. Capacitors are also the opposite of inductors. A good example of inductors are LONG WIRES - like the one that carries power from your car battery to your amplifier (and if you are a good installer you have a second wire that returns back to the negative battery terminal and don't use the chassis ground where you pick up noise from turn signals, etc into your audio system)You see, when a loud thump" comes down the audio signal cable to the amplifier, it may demand 100-200 amps of power from the battery + alternator for a fraction of a second and send that power into your subwoofer. If your power cable is inductive (a natural property of ALL cables, no matter how big or how fancy or how expensive), then it will resist a sudden change in current - that is the DEFINITION of inductance. By placing a capacitor across the positive and negative terminals of the amplifier in very close physical proximity, it negates the effects of that wire that feeds power to your amp and makes for a more constant voltage. As a result, your bass is cleaner and more defined, your amp does not distort and damage your speakers, and yes, it is louder. Do you need 5, 10, or 50 Farads? No. 1-1.5 Farads is more than enough unless you are going for more than 1000 watts.This unit also has a 3 digit LED display of the voltage (i.e. 13.8 ) in RED LEDs about 1/2 " tall and comes with some acrylic mounting brackets to hold it so you can read the voltage at your amplifier. If you see it bouncing around as your music plays, then you should use a larger capacitor.Be aware that you can not just "plug it in" - if you do so, the sudden inrush of power into the capacitor will damage it. Follow the instructions on the package to charge the capacitor with a light bulb in series for a few seconds until it reaches 13.8 VDC then remove the bulb. Also NEVER short circuit the capacitor as this can also damage the insides. Use a light bulb or the LED display to drain the power out of it. If you obey these rules, then sparks won't fly.Finally, the LED display draws 50 mA ALL THE TIME, so in one day it draws 1.2 Amp-Hours from your car's battery if left sitting (there is no "power on" terminal for the display - it is always on). In a month of sitting it will drain your car battery. You may wish to install a relay or battery switch to turn off your stereo (or just remove the fuse) when not using it at the airport parking lot so you can start your car when you get back.All together I am impressed with this 1.5 Farad cap I received which is not the one shown in the picture. I am using it with a power inverter to produce 120 VAC at 1000 Watts and it works fine, but I have also used them in car stereo installs before when the customer wanted louder, tighter bass from their subwoofer package or was getting distortion or having their amp cut out when the bass was cranked up. The cap will fix the problem for you.Enjoy in clean health and post some pictures of your install!"
These slim jewel cases by TDK provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. Could that be because I'm a 90 pound weakling? SMILE Well, I doubt it--I think these are well constructed. They hold together for years at a time and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases provide excellent storage for media and they measure roughly half the width of the older, original jewel cases that seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too.Moreover, these jewel cases are affordable--and that's great in these times. Each case costs roughly 40 cents which is great considering how long these will last for you. Years' worth of storage space! These jewel cases can be storing discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or whatever. They are not ugly, either.Overall, I highly recommend this CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. Use these in good health!SMILE"
IOMEGA ZIP 250 DiskThe IOMEGA ZIP 250 disk is a high-capacity removable storage disk that is about the size of a standard 3.5 floppy disk. It can be read and written by an internal IDE drive (only one per system) or an external drive connected to a USB port or a parallel port (slowest in access). The IomegaWare Software provides utility functions designed for the ZIP disk, such as formatting or copying a disk. You should never use the Operating System disk copy function. Use the EJECT utility to remove a disk from a drive; this is required in Windows NT or Windows 2000. Remove the disk before turning a computer off You should never insert a ZIP disk in the drive when the computer is on as this can cause damage. Normally, shutting down the computer causes the disk to eject. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole.The IomegaWare software tests for the presence of the ZIP drive. It should be used in Windows 2000 to format a ZIP disk in the FAT format. Removable disks can contain a lot of data when it can be partitioned into 250 MB segments. The data on a ZIP drive can be read and written by different versions of an Operating System (using the FAT format). Rewriting reuses space, it does not increase the used space. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat (sunshine). The 250 MB ZIP disks can be read and written by a 750 MB drive.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
The Sony TCM-929 Pressman Desktop Cassette Recorder with Automatic Shut-Off is a pretty good--maybe even very good--tape recorder in this price range. I like the fact that it takes the traditional old fashioned type of tape recorder and improves upon it. We get features like a microphone jack, a headphone jack--and there's even automatic shutoff for when we can't be there right at the exact minute the tape stops playing! The handle also makes for easy portability; this can be used to record just about any sound. Words, music, lectures and conversations, you name it.The buttons are easy to read and understand; there's practically no explanation needed for the five or six buttons in the front of the tape recorder that handle features including play, fast forward and rewind. The pause and eject buttons work reliably, too. Great! Just as Amazon notes, there is also a built-in microphone and speaker--but if you want a very clear voice recording there is a microphone jack so that people can get a very good recording of their thoughts right onto that cassette tape.It even comes with an AC adapter! If you need to carry this around and you can't plug it into an electrical outlet, just use the four AA batteries you'll need for roughly eight hours of usage. Of course, if you use strong batteries you may get up to nine or even ten hours usage; I think eight hours is slightly too short for what you'll get out of battery usage.One thing I must tell you--as I'm sure you can imagine, this isn't exactly the world's most durable tape recorder. After all, the price is very good for people in all income brackets. What does this mean? It means that I wouldn't bang it around or let small children play with it unsupervised. If dropped it could well break and that would be a shame. Handle with care for the maximum life of this tape recorder!Another caveat: although they say it records lectures well, I'm not sure just how well it will be able to record a professor's lecture unless you're rather close to the professor when they talk. This occurs simply because it's not capable of picking up voices and nuances of words from larger distances. I will have to take off one star for this to make this a four star review. Believe me, I tried to use this for my continuing education Spanish classes; and I was disappointed. I was not able to get a consistently clear recording of what the teacher had said. Good thing I took notes just in case this failed me on that score! One way to possibly get around this is to ask the teacher if you can place the tape recorder on their desk while they lecture; maybe that will work if your teacher doesn't mind.Overall, this is one fine tape recorder for everyday use and less demanding tasks like recording your own thoughts. It records especially well when you use a microphone that plugs into the machine instead of using the built in microphone. If you're looking for a good tape recorder in this price range and you don't need extremely heavy-duty features, this tape recorder is for you!
I received in great time and it was as if brought out of the store.Very basic but does the job.Thanks,
I follow the progression of Apple's Powerbook line of notebook computers closely. In fact, I try to read up on the history of the line and people's experiences with each model, whenever I have a chance. I also own a Powerbook, and I eagerly await each update to the line, in order to see, if it is time, for me to upgrade.In October 2005, Apple updated its Powerbook G4 15 & 17 inch models, for the first time, since late January 2005. Unfortunately, a faster processor was not included in the update. However, it was still a worthy update!Processor - The 17-inch Powerbook continues to be ran by a PowerPC G4 processor running at 1.67 GHZ. This processor is more than acceptable, for the vast majority of customers. It does a great job at daily computer tasks, and it is even very capable, for pretty intense photo work, and light video work. It is only unfortunate that we could not have seen a small boost to the processors, however, it was evidently not something feasible in this update, so Apple made up for it, with updates to other areas!Screen Resolution - The biggest improvement to the 17-inch Powerbook is an increase in screen resolution. Simply, a higher resolution allows you to fit more data, onto your display, making you more productive. The display now sports a 1680x1050 resolution, which was previously only1440x960. The new resolution is as high as Apple's 20-inch cinema display, so you will be able to fit more applications and more of your photographs, on the screen. A valuable asset.Double Layer Superdrive - The Powerbook G4 now has superdrives (DVD burning capable) across the line. However, the 15 & 17 inch Powerbooks now sport double-layer super drives, which allows you to fit up to 8.5GB of data, on a single double layer disk. The drive's speed is still marketed as 8x.Memory - The Powerbook continues to come standard, with 512 MB of memory, but new system architecture now makes use of DDR2 memory. The 17 inch Powerbooks can be user upgraded, to have a maximum of 2 GB of memory. If you're going to be using your Powerbook, for more than basic consumer tasks, you will want to add more memory.Graphics - The 17-inch Powerbook now features 128MB of video memory standard, and the ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 card allows you to connect your 17-inch Powerbook to beautiful, big, displays such as the Apple 30-inch cinema display.Ports - The 17-inch Powerbooks have a great array of ports. Some of the very best in the industry. S-Video output, DVI output (plus a VGA adapter), Firewire 800, Firewire 400, Gigabit Ethernet, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio in, audio out, and a PC card slot. Whatever it is, you'll probably find a way to connect it to your Powerbook G4.Mac OS X - If you're considering Macintosh for the first time, you're going to love the Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger. It is incredibly user friendly, and you'll quickly find the interface and design is saving you time. Furthermore, Mac OS X is much more secure than Windows, so you can put your mind at rest.iLife - Although many power and professional users of a Powerbook are going to be using his or her Mac, for a lot of professional work, with professional applications, Apple still includes iLife with every Mac. iLife is a great way to manage your personal digital life. Store and manage your digital images in iPhoto, jam to music in iTunes, create music in Garageband, and create simple movies in iMovie.Furthermore, there are convenient applications built right into the operating system such as Dashboard, iCal (a great calendar that syncs up with your external devices including iPod), Dictionary, Expose, Stickies, DVD Player, and more.Hard Drive - The 17-inch Powerbook now comes standard, with its biggest hard drive yet. The last model had a 100 GB drive standard, but this Powerbook has a 120 GB drive. It runs at 5400 RPM. An upgrade to a 7200 RPM drive is available, from Apple directly.Appearance - The Aluminium enclosed Powerbook G4 may very well be the most beautiful notebook computer line ever made. It is an easy case to argue, for the sleek lines and beautiful finish catches the eye of all who see it.Battery Life - In ideal conditions, the 17-inch Powerbook G4 now sports longer battery life, with up to 5.5 hours.Wireless - Your 17-inch Powerbook will come standard, with an Airport Extreme card, for wireless networking. Furthermore, a bluetooth module is included, allowing you to use wireless devices, such as keyboards and mice, plus sync devices such as a mobile phone.Price - The 17-inch Powerbook is a better value than ever. Not only does it pack in more features than it previously offered, but it is also two hundred dollars chapter.Overall, Apple has put great new features, in this update to the 17-inch Powerbook G4. You'll find yourself more productive with its high-resolution display, double layer superdrive, bigger hard drive, and fantastic video output options, with its capable video card. The Powerbook G4 17-inch is a fully-capable and feature-rich professional notebook computer. If you choose it as your notebook computer, you will no doubt benefit from its performance, reliability, and simplicity of design.
These adapters with a 20 or 25 foot hdmi male male cable give you the means to extend oddballs like the 3 foot micro hdmi for droid phones to full size hdmi to reach the tv set from the a/v adapter and charger and sound and usb output device motorola makes for the bionic.The odd thing is I waited this long to buy one! I've tried to use hdmi proper length cables to prevent the need for the adapter, but its integral to the hdmi system. Don't run your hdmi too far and things will be OK in the digital domain. I bought a 25 foot optical cable to extend my sound on fiber to where I need it also - that worked out very well.Anyhow not alot to say here except they are well made and do the trick. If you want to make a 25foot oddball hdmi to regular hdmi then extend it 25 feet - this is how to do it and have signal at the end - note some oddballs dont always have sound but most do I had one without sound and had to get the optical extension instead)
This product is great. The price is very worth it. these are very nice speakers for ipod listening. Surprisingly large sound that can fill an apartment with pretty good quality. definately get more than your money's worth and great for trips.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar 128MB xD-Picture Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
This Casio BC-30L rapid charger charges the Casio NP-40 (or compatible) LiIon battery used in most Exilim digital cameras (e.g., EX-Z40/Z50/Z55/Z57/Z750). It charges a fully discharged NP-40 in about two hours; a partially empty NP-40 takes less time.The best thing about the charger is it's small -- about the same size as a Z40/Z50 camera. It weighs a mere 2.2 oz, making it very convenient to carry. It's a one-piece, wall-plug type, supporting universal voltage (100-240V AC, 50/60Hz). If you travel outside of the U.S., you do need an electric plug adapter since different parts of the world use different shapes of plugs.This charger is great for charging your spare NP-40 battery -- and it's highly recommended that you have a spare battery for your Exilim camera. I got an NP-40 clone for under $18 here on Amazon.
Belkin makes a great USB 2.0 cable to connect computer hardware together for the ultimate computer experience! The cord is cheap, backward compatible and it does the job very reliably.I recently purchased a new printer and used this product after having used it to hook up for old printer to my current computer. The cable made hardware recognition and setup remarkably easy as data was transmitted incredibly fast between the printer and the computer.Hey, I'm no computer technician expert who can speak in fancy computerese" terms; but when people say this USB 2.0 cable does the job and more they truly must mean it. I have no complaints about this cable.I highly recommend this product by Belkin for people who need a USB cable. It sure is inexpensive; and you get great quality and value for your buck.Get one today if you need it--you won't be disappointed."
Amazing. 1GB of DDR2 PC2-4200 costs $180 at Best Buy, Staples, etc. Even on sale they cost almost $80 or $90, and those stores carry no-name brands. Crucial is made by Micron so the memory quality is great. I bought this for my Dell Dimension 8400 after the Samsung RAM it came with burned out after just 13 months (right after the one-year warranty went out!). Given my past experience with Crucial RAM, I have no doubt that this will last a long time.Note: PCs that use DDR2 RAM almost always require the RAM be intalled in pairs, so be sure to get 2 or 4 each time. This kit has 2 512MB modules.
This CD tower by Atlantic holds 100 CDs in their jewel cases. It is compact and it's certainly no eyesore. I use this rack to store CDs and I am satisfied.Another wonderful feature of this CD storage tower is that it can be stored just about anywhere, too--at 32 inches high this storage tower is compact while doing the job of storing your CDs in an orderly and presentable fashion.The rack is constructed of black steel wire with cherrywood" knobs. Caution: at this price you shouldn't expect real wood knobs. The "cherrywood" knobs look somewhat like fake wood or laminate. This is a minor disappointment, however.My only complaint is that the CD jewel cases often slide to one side or the other as they rest in their slots in this storage tower. Unless you are rather careful the CDs eventually look a bit disorderly; but again this is a relatively minor complaint and it may not bother you.Overall, if you want an inexpensive CD storage rack this is the way to go. It is affordable and this will last forever. Great for storing your CDs!"
Great quailty, well made and my iPod nano fits in it well. Sound is as good as can be expected considering the size of the speakers.

I used this brand of disposable," single use camera recently and the pictures came out fairly well. Oh, sure, the quality of the pictures won't be 100% as good as the pictures you would get from a digital camera or a standard, more expensive 35 mm camera. Actually, the pictures these Fuji cameras take are even slightly grainier than the Kodak single use cameras. Sigh.However, the camera is very lightweight so you can carry several at a time in a bag as you travel. I especially like the built in flash that is easy to use. The flash range is about 10 feet.The camera is a single use camera; this means that after you use it you take the entire camera to the place where you can get film developed; they will take care of the rest. No worrying about whether or not you removed the roll of film negatives correctly without exposing them to too much light. I love that! The film speed is 400, so keep that in mind when choosing this camera. A faster speed such as 800 may be preferable.Overall, this is a good single use camera for countless people who like to travel light or who are on a budget. It is very compact and easy to carry; keep one in the glove compartment of your car just in case there's an accident and you need to take pictures of the scene. The camera is also affordable. I give it three and stars instead of five simply because the picture quality just isn't the best."
Last year (2003) I bought an earlier variant of this same series and have been very happy with my PC. The current C2310 is very similar to what I bought, so I'll just review this from my experience.For my money, when I buy a laptop, I want it to be of the highest quality. I'm paying serious money, and I expect to rely on the laptop for a couple years before upgrading (well, in my case I upgrade more often than that), so I want -- and you should, too -- to buy a machine with high-quality parts.Dell and Gateway, from my experience with their products, seem to use cheap parts that break easily. So what if you buy an on-site warranty? If your PC breaks down (like my Dell desktop does every so often), you still have to spend hours on the phone with some person from India who cannot speak proper English (in David Pogue's words, they do one side of an SNL skit), and then after wasting hours of your time, they reluctantly agree to send a technician over. Then you'll have to wait for that guy to come over the next day (or, if you called support after 5 pm central time, on the third day -- and this is assuming you have next-day service, otherwise you'll have to deal with the hassles of shipping the thing back), and you have no idea what time he or she will show up or if he or she can fix the problem. So, let's assume you save a couple hundred bucks on your purchase, but in the end, because the parts are low-quality, you suffer.Anyway, this is why I like my Fujitsu laptops. They are all very high-quality. I'm not affiliated with Fujitsu in anyway (check my profile), and I definitely don't know if you could pick up a lemon or not. But in my exprience, Fujitsu computers work fast, are well designed and built, and always beat my ever-rising expectations.The C-series is meant as a value-oriented desktop replacement. Even though their prices are competitive vis-a-vis Dell and Gateway and HP, their quality is far superior to the other manufacturers. These are *solid* machines. They are not hyped-up speed demons that eventually melt down. They don't look glamorous junkies with a defective motherboard. They are just solid tools. Whether you surf wirelessly or do you personal finance or write your next Harry Potter-buster or burn DVDs and CDs, the Fujitsu's get the work done.It's sad that a bunch of moron are running Fujitsu's marketing department. Once again, it proves that good engineering and manufacturing cannot sell products. Dell makes low-quality products but they make people believe they are good. The world is such an unfair place, isn't it?
TDK makes a very reliable blank CD-R that can handle up to 80 minutes of music or 700 megabytes of data. These blank CD-Rs can record data at very high speeds. The data I record onto these CD-Rs has now lasted for years. I have used these as data discs and discs to record various types of audio files including MP3s. I almost never get a coaster.The CD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data or music onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your CD-Rs that have anything stored on them.Two warnings:1) Don't write on the CD-R itself with a Sharpie ink pen. The ink seeps through slowly but surely and this could easily damage your data, music or whatever is stored on the disc. If you label the disc, label it using a post-it note.2) Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in a hot place. CD-Rs hate the heat! Heat can cause damage to your discs so keep them in a relatively cool place. The cooler the storage place, the better.When burning the disc, don't be surprised if you see the data being recorded at speeds of less than 52x. This may be a quirk; I am not sure. However, it only means a minute or two of extra time to burn the disc--it's well worth it and I wouldn't aggravate myself too much over this.Overall, TDK blank CD-R discs store data reliably over time and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at the very highest speed advertised.
Included in this kit you get the blaster (the face of the kit) which when viewed with NV goggles shows how much IR light it really dumps out - about 100x what a remote does, plus you get 8 mice to stick over the IR receiver of the products you are controlling, which guarantees they get the signal.Even better, you can put these in multiple rooms and use one remote to operate equipment in various parts of the house.
As of, the SLSV570 from Panasonic broke on me for 2 months. This was somewhat ridiculous. No, the lid did not fall off as that was a very common problem with that player. The LCD shattered, makling the player unusable.Yes, I was heptic on buying another Panasonic, but I didn't want to pay $70 for a Sony or $20-$30 on an el cheapo" brand such as Durabrand, GPX, J-Win, Coby, etc.First off, it's easily noticeable that Panasonic took control of their errors of the SLSV570. They also added a few extras people have been begging for, such as a remote, a slimmer esign, two hinges for the lid so it is strongly on. These are only some of the extras of the SLCT582V.The player's sound is even better than my friend's recent Sony (DFJ-200). The bass booster has been more enhanced than the SLSV570, which I had problems with onthe bass boost due to disortation. Now, that seems to be mostly removed. There is also a new feature that is called "3-Way D.Sound". It is basically a live equalizer, so you can hear concert sound right from your little player. This is a nice feature, though cannot be used on AM/FM radio, but on CDs and MP3 discs.The construction is the biggest improvement. The duble hinges do make the lid strongly held, and the player's top seems like it could do some strong use fine, unlike the SLSV570 with only one hinge on the lid, and geting scratched easily. It seems there is a metal boundary on the inside of the player, which says a lot about construction and that Panasonic cares about their customers.Like I stated earlier, there are many features on the SLCT582V. There is a 30 station memory as an upgrade of 20. I haven't found out if the player has ID3 tags or not. I'm thinking it doesn't, though that would be a nice improvement. The CD Player/MP3 CD Player works wonderful, and I've had a hard time at trying to make the player skip. The player seems to have a bigger output, but not that bigger. Bigger enough that it will make 11 go to 7 or 8. You figure it out. If you haven't owned a Panasonic, I still think these will power most headphones. As I mentioned earlier, it does have a bonus remote that can be used on any 3.5mm headphone. The player comes with behind-the-neck headphones. They actually are pretty worthy, though I'd rather use my Sony h.ears. The remote has backward, forward, stop, play, cd/radio switch, volume, and hold buttons. Nothing advanced like repeat, random, program, bass boost, memory, or anything special, but you rarely switch those anyway. Besides, the remote would be too crowded with that. Also, the player is much slimmer, and equivalent to 10 CDs stacked. That's pretty awesome!Any cons? The color is a bit boring. Otherwise, I truly think there aren't any.The cost is still $60, but the SLCT582V is worth it for the CD/MP3, AM radio, and FM radio player. And don't forget all the extras! Happy shopping, and enjoy!"
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Sandisk 64MB Memory Stick, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I just got this and my first impressions are totally positive. I bought it because I was really sick and tired of the dangling headphone wire, which sometimes gets caught on my jacket or other things. I'm surprised that there aren't many products like this.With support for MP3 and AAC (advanced audio coding, a better-than-MP3 audio format developed by Dolby), the SD05 can hold up to 2 hours of hi-fi music. It's surprisingly easy to operate, and because it's foldable, easy to transport, too. The manual is a bit skimpy, but I think most people can figure it out pretty quick. The headset itself is comfortable, although I wish there were more bass.
The case perfectly fits my 80G models and the belt clip is a nice option and functions well. For the current price (even including shipping), this is a very good value compared to similar units you'll find at most retail outlets, therefore, I highly recommend this!
I got a Samsung MP3 Player (YH925GS). Problem, my microsystem has no line out, and uses wires to connect to the speakers.So, I needed something to connect to my microsystem, because who wouldn't want an MP3 player blasting out 200 something watts?The cassette adaptor was a thought. Then I realized how dumb I was even thinking about it, because the microsystem has the cassette door shut. So, the FM transmitter was the only option.I felt shakey about this, because if you went to Tucson, you'd see that our station numbers are pretty spread out. 89.1, 90.5, 91.3, 92.1, 92.9, 93.7, 94.9, 96.1, 97.5, 98.3, 99.5, 102.1, 104.1, 104.9, 106.3, and 107.5. If you look at those station numbers, you'll see a fairly big gap between 99.5 and 102.1. With that said, placing it on 100.7 made it perfect. The sound was not clear. Here's the thing, it doesn't matter how far apart stations are, it's the clearness of the station you're using. However, I did find very clear signals at 90.1, 91.7, 106.9 (so that was the techno music I heard down the street), and 107.7. Just go to your radio, and skip down stations and find one that has only fuzz and no station interferring. That's how you can tell if this will work or not. If you can't find a station with only fuzz and no interrference, your unfortunately gonna have to buy a normal cassette adapter. Though, if you find one or some stations with only fuzz, like I did, then this will work excellently.Instead of placing it near the microsystem, I put it too the test. I placed it directly in the center of my apartment, checking to see how well the signal was. Well, as it's advertised at 10 feet, I got 12 feet...and I didn't test it further. So, a walk outside, realizing that I got it up to 40 feet. Then yet, I don't live directly in Tucson, I live about 15 miles away from metro Tucson, which may be a reason of why this worked so well. People living in urban-ish areas probably won't even get 30 feet, but it's worth a shot.Overall, if you own an MP3 player, you HAVE to get this.
I've been recently using a pair of Koss UR21's for my home system. Now, I won't hate on them, they actually sound pretty darn good for the low price, but they sound very average compared to the Sennheisers I had before them. I tried some headphones and was left a bit disappointed until I looked at these. Someone had recommended them to me, and I read some online reviews and no one had anything bad to say about these cans. And not to mention on here (for some reason) they're offered way below MSRP. I've been burning them in a bit, and have to say these are some good headphones--great detail, ridiculous value, and good looks make me give these a good four stars.Now, first sound, you must understand, when I rate headphones I rate them on a value", which means if they're $5, I'm not going to say they flat out suck. I'm going to say they're good for the price. And for the MSRP, these are good, actually excellent for the price. Very neutral bass, which makes these sound very decent on detailed music. The bass isn't offensively muddy, though some hip-hop fans will be disappointed in the neutral bass. I know any hip-hop fan loves to explode the bass, if so look up the HD555's instead. Anyhow, even when I turn on my bass booster, they don't sound bass-light, just neutral. Which is a good thing, right? The mids are well represented, and don't sound overpowered one bit, even at higher volumes. They sound slightly dry, but I actually like this type of sound, which is again why after reading some reviews on some headphones sites I was highly interested in these. The upper mids sound very similar to the lower mids, not overpowered, and a bit dry sounding. The treble is like most Sennheisers, not bright like the Grados, but detailed. They lack in 14-16k treble, but sound great above that range. They release some new things to songs and sound a bit fuzzy on 128 kbps MP3s (be honest, you're excited now). With a slight EQ adjustment, these can possibly sound completely flat. Again, these are not suited for those who want extra extra bass explosion, and are really different from the 150's and 250's of this line, but are very detailed and flatter-sounding cans. If you enjoy that sound you should be pleased with these. The soundstage is also a bit more open than most other headphones.As far as comfort, these are fairly comfortable, but feel a bit tight at first. The earcups are comfy, but the headband is a little tight for my head. But I suppose this is trivial. They don't look adjustable from the photo, but they are. I got a little confused by the photo as well, I thought these were blue/silver. I think I might upload a picture of mine, the Amazon photo is small. They are silver, but the earcups are actually gray. And I had to take a laugh, on the headband theyy have a trash can with a big X on it. Who would actually throw these away? Even if you didn't like the sound, I'm sure you'd return them or sell them. Back to the headphones, they have a 10-foot cord, which is good because I no longer have to use my extension for my only 4-foot Koss. The cord might bother the portable crowd a bit, otherwise they provide a ton of room from your source. Speaking of portable sources, these have 32 Ohms, so they power fine on basically anything you throw at them. Portability-wise, these don't fold up, but are a bit smaller than what some others claim, even though I'll still be using my earbuds for that cause.Overall, a solid set of headphones for the home user in mind. They could be a bit more comfortable, but the sound is very good, they look well crafted, and have a roomy 10-foot cord. For the cost, these are definitely worth it. I'd also recommend these if you want to enter the audiophile world. 4 stars."
When you look for a small hard drive-based keychain drive, don't let size and/or price alone dictate your choice. You want something that's small but also fast (so you don't have to wait), reliable (so it doesn't go kaput when you need it the most), and power-efficient (so it works everywhere).This last point is very important. This Sony USD5G drive is a 5GB external drive that requires very little power to run and therefore works in all the different USB ports I've tried it on: laptops new and old, desktops, USB 1.0 ports, USB 1.1 ports, and, of course, USB 2.0 ports.While this is not the tiniest keychain hard disk -- Archos has a 2GB drive that's even smaller and lighter, but the Archos does not work reliably in many, many USB ports. (I'll never buy another Archos again; their products look great on paper but often fail to perform in practice, and their tech support is no help.) A Seagate 5GB drive is small as well, but may not work in some laptop USB ports. Of all the small, keychain hard disks I've tried, the Sony USD5G is the only one that worked all the time, and this is the one I'm keeping.Speed is fast. Its max transfer rate is 12MB/sec, while in my tests I was able to get, on average, about 10MB/sec with large and small files alike. It's very quiet and stays cool even after extended use, and it features Sony's famous G-shock anti-shock technology.The USB connector is attached on the drive itself and can swivel 180 degrees. The connector also seems more reliable and confident than the one on the Archos. It'll fit in all sorts of USB ports.The included software (on the drive itself, taking up about 10MB, which you can delete) can sync documents in folders you specify, and even keep track of the version changes. Pretty cool.In short, this is the best keychain hard drives out there. It's a bit more expensive, but totally worth the extra for its speed, reliability, power efficiency, and coolness.
If you own a digital camera and take a lot of pictures and value your own time, then get this. With SimpleTech's 128MB Compact Flash card and reader I'm able to get the most out of my Canon Powershot G2. I can store 200 photos then download them incredibly fast to my PC without wasting my camera battery life or mine.
All I can say with this breathtakingly gorgeous HDTV is wow!!!" Actually I couldn't even say it out aloud when I first turned it on because I was simply speechless. And the "wow" applies to both the picture quality (remember, not all 1080p TVs are created equal) and the price. 73", measured diagonally, is perfect for a large living room and for inviting friends over for a great party. This set is also the perfect companionion to the Sony Playstation 3: whether you play HD PS3 games or watch Blu-ray movies, you'll have a blast each and every time. (Good thing that DLP-based TVs don't suffer from the "burn-in" problem.) This is just awesome."

I purchased the Ipod Nano Light skins for my daughter and she just loved them! I thought they were a great value when compared to prices for similar products in the store
I was extremly happy with this case. It actually clip on to your shuffle so it's very secure. I highly recommend these cases
Great price, great value, great quality, decent customer service. Toshiba is doing things right. The V390 has progressive scan which gives you clearer pictures than regular DVD players. The VCR has self-cleaning so you don't have to clean the heads often, maybe once every couple years should suffice. Everything works fine. Obviously, you can't copy most commercial DVD movies to VHS tape, due to Macrovision protection. Toshiba and Panasonic now also sell DVD burners for home use, and they are cool (but still expensive).
This tiny battery (weighing about 1 oz.) can power an Exilim Z-series camera for a long time. Casio has done an excellent job. This is the official Casio battery (made in China) and it's always a good idea to get a second battery as backup.
The amazon page says this is 1.2 inches in length, 2 inches in width, and 48 inches long. WRONG. The channel which will hold 3 cables of average size (e.g. rg-6 or rg-59 video cable, standard a/c power cord, etc) will hold 3 cables snugly across - it's about 1.2 inches wide outside, but inside is what matters if you have ALOT of cables. Unless you use some micro cables you won't get more than 3 standard size cables inside this track. The 2 dimention I argue with - there is nothing about the track that measures 2" wide. It's 1.2 wide, with under 1" of space inside, and about 3/8" off the wall (call it tall?) - yes the lengths are 48" long.Wiremold has been used to hide ugly cables for a long time - this was perfect for my job - I just wall mounted a 23" HDTV in my dad's kitchen for him to catch the early morning news with coffee etc. (the set was an LG 23" with more inputs than you could imagine for computer use and a tv antenna / cable input as well - we are using it with a rooftop TV antenna on the house that grabs about 88 ATSC channels, of which we delete around 30 that are advertising or specialized language/childrens programming leaving a healthy 58 free tv channels on the tv set)The cables were ugly though. RG-6 coax for the antenna feed, power and VGA to a small laptop that logs weather data from the usb port on the weather station I bought as a gift for my parents all had to go to the back of the set - it was a cable nightmare.With the wiremold full, it drops straight down below the set with 3 cables inside (and they are snug) goes into an elbow to follow the baseboard, then goes through a T connector where the power cord comes out and into an outlet next to the T connector - the wiremold continues to the corner of the room where the RG-6 antenna cable enters the channel and from that point it has 10" left for the VGA cable.NOTES for successful installation.I made some mistakes so I'll share them with you for your install - best to learn from others mistakes!The fittings (T, left elbow, right elbow, inside corner, outside corner) are very generous, but they do not adhere to the wiremold channel, they go OVER the channel. Because of this if you stick the channel to the wall directly touching the baseboard, you will not be able to put he fittings over the wiremold afterwards because it needs to go between the stick of wiremold and the baseboard - so the trick is lay a thin piece of plastic above the baseboard (1/16") then tack the channel down with the foam sticky back - that way you'll have room for the fittings to go over it (same rule goes for corners)When cutting it, I used a hitachi power miter saw instead of a hacksawHitachi C10FCE2 10-Inch Compound Miter Saw- don't make real fast cuts even with the fast saw - let the blade come up to full speed then gradually slip it through the channel as if you were cutting a hardwood. If you make fast cuts, the blade teeth (and this goes for sawzalls too) can snag the non-opening edge of the channel and split the thin plastic - now you have a channel with an opening on two sides, one is a crack, the other a j hook mold. I put some clear shipping tape over the crack like amazon uses to ship boxes to you and held the crack together, then make slow milling type cuts with the saw which came out very clean with square edges on both the use piece and waste piece.Always place the J hook side where you'll be able to open it later if you think you will add a cable at a later date, i.e. don't put the J clasp edge down towards the baseboard or you'll have a hard time getting it open later. Same goes for a corner of a wall going vertical.When the project was finished it looked 200% better - no cable mess any more, no cables visable at all, and the adhesive is strong enough it will pull the paint off the wall before it comes off by itself, so make sure you have a level handy for vertical runs to give you an edge because once you stick it on the wall its not comming off. Consider it permanent after 5 seconds (I was able to carefully reposition a small 10 inch piece that had not fully adhered yet by slowly pealing it off the paint as soon as I realized I had a problem)Make sure your cables do not have the RFI filters (those big blobs usually close to the end of the cable) because those won't go into the channel if they are far back from the connector (my monitor came with a cable like this and I had to buy a replacement VGA cable that has the RFI filters up close to the connector instead)Final install tip, although it seems best to put the T connector for a power plug right under the outlet, I found it was better tooffset the T about 2-4 inches from the power outlet. This way the cable comes out and has room to lay over before going into the outlet and does not put stress on the t cover, which has no adhesive to hold it on. If it is right under the outlet it will tend to force the T joint off of the wiremold strip.This kit gives you everything you need to go 12 feet, make an inside corner, and outside corner, go up or down the wall, join two pieces together and one T connector to let cables exit near an outlet. Don't expect to put more than 3 normal size (1/4") cables inside it and you won't be disappointed, but it is not 1.2 x 2.0 x 48" as the amazon specifications say. It's more like 1.2 x 3/8 in x 4 feet long strips x 3 + all the parts. Amazon needs to correct the measurements and make it clear what the raceway outside and inside dimentions are. If I expected 1.2x2.0 " as their page says, and could not fit 6 cables into it I would be upset, but my install worked out."
This surge protector from Belkin does an excellent job of protecting your electronic equipment from any damage or problems should there be a power surge. I have used this product for years now without any complaints.The surge protector benefits from a simplistic design; for people like myself this is certainly sufficient to protect my computer and printer. There are six power outlets that also, of course, allow you to protect and plug in six things all at once. Just plug in the surge protector into an electrical outlet and there you are! Everything should be fine.The cord does extend four feet and that's an added plus. You do get a warranty with this mechanism, too.Obviously, I would never use this to light up a fish tank or place it near anything liquid. That could clearly start a fire.Overall, I have had no problems with this Belkin surge suppressor. I highly recommend this product.

Memorex makes a very reliable blank CD-R that can handle up to 80 minutes of music or 700 megabytes of data. Moreover, these blank CD-Rs are capable of recording data at high speeds. The data I recorded onto these CD-Rs has now lasted for over three years, proving the test of time. I have used these as data discs and discs to record audio. I almost never got a coaster. Great!The CD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data or music onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your CD-Rs that have anything stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than the packaging advertises (52x). This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your CD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the CD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--and you wouldn't want that, now would you? If you need to label the discs, label its' jewel case using a post-it note. At least that's what I do.Overall, Memorex blank CD-R discs store data reliably over the years and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at the very highest speed advertised.Use them in good health!
Great service and a great price! The case works very well, my sansa player perfectly fits in it. thanks!
In addition to CD-ROM recording, this excellent drive from Sony burns DVD+R/RW discs, i.e., the plus" standard of DVD recording. It can NOT be used with DVD-R/RW ("dash") media. It's been quite reliable. The downside to the drive is not due to the drive itself, but rather the media: DVD+RW (write-many-times) is still not popular and may be be compatible with many DVD-ROM drives and certainly most DVD players. DVD+R (the write-once-only media) has better compatibility. One last thing about DVD burning is the media is still quite expensive... and you cannot duplicate your favorite DVD movies! :)If you wish to save some money, you may look into DVD burners from HP or Toshiba. Avoid generic brands with unpronounceable names. :)"
I bought this card reader for my borther. He said that this item works very well and he can transfer the data to his laptop wherever he goes.

I bought this charger for my workplace. I can share this charger with my fellows who use different PAD or blackberry. It works well!. We like this item much!
If you just dropped $250+ for a carbon fiber tripod, you'll want to protect it. Carbon fiber is stronger than steel but lacks the ductility (ability to bend) that steel and aluminum have. When it reaches its yield strength things shatter, and with baggage handlers trying to cram everything onboard in under 10 minutes you don't want your big bucks tripod comming out as a bunch of shards of carbon fiber tube at the destinatation (I like to go carry on with my tripod for this exact reason - but sometimes it's hard to carryon an entire eng kit)This bag has much more padding than other, cheaper bags on the market - that's what you are paying for, not the light weight, but protection. That means that some tripod/head combinations won't fit inside the bag. Be prepared to remove and re-install your head. Often the head is heavier than the tripod, so it might ship separately anyways.This is a small price to pay for insurance on expensive tripods against crushing effects on carbon fiber. I finally went for it when the prices dropped $10 figuring it was worth the new price to protect my investment in lightweight portability.
My cable came with 18ga wire - that is not to say they all do - but I've seen other brands that ship with 22 or 24 ga wire. The voltage drop on the tiny wires is really too much on a 12VDC system, thus I prefer the 18 ga design.You'll need a crimper and some BNC crimps like thesePaladin 9730 RG59 BNC SealTite Compression Connectors, 10-Packwhich are designed for rg-59 cable diameter. You'll also need the universal paladin crimp tool because the bnc is such a big connector compared to the catv F connector.Paladin 4910 SealTite Pro Compression Cable TV F" Kit wi th KT 8, LC CST, Flaring Tool, SealTite Pro and 10 RG6/RG6Q in Zipper CaseThis cable spool came with two end pieces that allowed you to unreel from either direction (they suspended the spool above ground and made a bearing surface to spin on)considering the cable without the power wires siamesed sells locally at FRYS for $110 the package is a good deal in the $120 price range. I've alreay used one spool and ordered a 2nd - my first one was black and I'll update the review if the 2nd comes any other color. I must admit white is not what I would expect, but the extension cables with the q-see cameras are often white."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Memory Upgrades 128MB Secure Digital Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

Alert: there's a twenty-dollar rebate if you buy this from J&R; via Amazon before 12/31/2005.The ZyXEL AG-225H 802.11a/b/g Wi-Fi Finder & USB Adapter (the official name) is a three-in-one device that packs some useful features for the wireless road warrior: it sniffs out access points (APs), it works as a USB wi-fi adapter, and it can turn an Internet-connected Windows PC into an access point!The package comes with the ZyXEL AG-225H adapter, a Quick Start Guide that describes the finder and wi-fi adapter functions, a software installation CD-ROM for Windows, a USB extension cable, and a wrist strap.Physically, the adapter is slightly larger than a pack of chewing gum. Its USB connector hides behind a cap. Inserting and removing the cap is a breeze, yet there is enough friction to keep the cap secure. In fact, this has the best balance of friction and ease of insertion/removal I've laid my fingers on; it actually feels good to put on and take off the cap! Unfortunately, the cap is small and, when taken off, can be misplaced very easily.The ZyXEL has a small b&w; LCD screen that shows hotspot info in the finder mode. When connected to a PC, it shows the status of the built-in LiIon rechargeable battery: charging, or full. Under the LCD screen are two blue LED indicators, one for power and the other for wi-fi access indication.There are two buttons at the top: one for controlling the seek mode (see below) and the other allowing you to scroll through the list of APs. It took me a while to remember not to use the Seek button as previous," as there is no previous button. You just keep pressing the Next button to cycle through the list of APs. There's a Power switch at the bottom. This power switch controls the finder mode; when connected to a PC, it has no function.Ok, now let's look at the three operational modes in detail.As a wi-fi finder, the ZyXEL allows you to identify nearby (and useable) wi-fi APs without having to turn on your laptop. The packaging says a scan takes only 6-7 seconds. Unfortunately that's false advertising. In my many repeated trials, it always takes at least 20 seconds, or as much as 30 to 35 seconds, for the finder to locate all the APs nearby. (The ZyXEL has a small built-in LiIon rechargeable battery which recharges whenever the adapter is inserted into a PC's USB port.)Once it displays the list of APs -- it can display up to 15 APs, sorted by signal strength (how useful!) -- the finder displays on the small LCD screen each AP's SSID, signal strength, security, type (802.11a, b or g), and channel. (Battery status of the adapter is also displayed.) Unfortunately, it does not refresh each AP's status automatically. You'll have to re-scan, by pressing the Seek button, to get up-to-date information on the APs.In addition to the basic AP finding mode, you can tell the ZyXEL to only show open APs, i.e., those without security. Note that an open AP doesn't necessarily mean it gives you free Internet access, as the host might have an account validation feature (e.g., many hotel APs). You can also tell the finder to lock on to a particular AP so you can "track" it.As a wi-fi adapter, the ZyXEL goes into a PC's USB port and allows you to surf the Internet wirelessly. Before you insert the ZyXEL for the first time, be sure to install the driver software first. Otherwise, Windows will not be able to recognize the adapter. The installation is very easy and straightforward. In addition to the driver (which includes a Windows service and a WinSock layer), you also get the ZyXEL wi-fi set-up utility. Note that this utility *only* works with the ZyXEL adapter.The ZyXEL utility displays a windows of useful information about your wi-fi connection, including a nice-looking signal strength bar. If all you want to do is connect to the nearest open AP, the utility does the job. But if you want to set up a particular SSID to access or security, good luck: the utility's interface is not too user-friendly. It's probably not going to be hard for you to figure things out (hint: go to the Profile section to set things up), but it's not very intuitive, esp. for non-expert computer users.At least, the adapter features excellent performance: it's very good at pulling in signal and maintaining steady, usable reception from the AP. It simply works very well. Its lightweight means it won't add much weight to your laptop.Finally, you can also use the ZyXEL hardware and software to turn your Internet-connected PC into an AP. Here your host PC is already connected to the Internet via Ethernet -- could be LAN, DSL, cable modem, dial-up, etc. -- and the ZyXEL can work in "access point mode." But you'll also need to set up Windows Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) in order for this to work. This involves some work. Please see my 12/5/05 blog entry for details on ICS setup. Once properly set up, the ZyXEL turns into a powerful AP.The documentation that came with the ZyXEL, both printed and electronic, is poor-quality, esp. the electronic user's guide, which misses important information about using the adapter as an AP. (That's why I created a blog entry to detail the steps needed.) E-mail support is fast; they e-mailed me back two hours after my initial inquiry, although the response had poor grammar and wasn't particularly helpful.In summary, if you are a wi-fi geek or a road warrior who wants to maximize wi-fi on your laptop, the ZyXEL AG-225H is quite a useful gizmo for finding nearby APs, quickly identifying open APs, and even turning a friend's PC or a hotel PC into an AP (assuming you can install the ZyXEL utility on that PC and have administrator right, too). I also like the ZyXEL's excellent performance as a wi-fi adapter."
I bought SimpleTech's 128 MB Compact Flash card and have been really happy with it. I use it with my Canon Powershot and enjoy the ability to store many more pixs. The transfer rate is fast too. I took in on vacation and couldn't take enough pixs to fill it up. I'd recommend this card.
Recently I've noticed the sanyo 2700 mah cells are failing - usually 1 cell out of 4 all matched into the same product (flash, recorder, etc). When charging you can see one sanyo cell is falling behind over time and soon hits the point where it wont take a charge and wont supply any power.The powerex 2700 perform almost identically to the sanyos, except they do not have 1 out of 4 cells that start to die and finally won't work.I'm actually happier using the powerex 2700 now than the sanyo and plan to convert to them as my sanyo cells die off. (I try to keep matched sets to prevent reverse discharge, so when 1 of 4 cells dies you're stuck trying to find a replacement set and end up with one good battery waiting for another failure to take the good one paired with it and make a new set if they match in capacity)Believe me its a pain, but the advantage is you avoid the reverse charge problem.
The adaptor worked great in my trip to UK. I didn't have any problem with it. Great!
Ever since Apple introduced the Power Mac G5, in 2003, it has been the top dog, when it comes to Macs. Every Mac fan, geek, or professional wants one. With the October 2005 update to the Power Mac G5, Apple has made its professional desktop more powerful than ever.The Power Mac is impressive right out of the box, with its beautiful aluminium enclosure. Truly, it is a piece of art.Processor - The power, in this Powermac, comes from its dual-core 2GHZ Power PC G5 processor. This is the latest technology, from IBM. This single dual-core chip provides significant speed increase over the previous dual processor model. The processor features a 1GHZ front side bus. This is a trend that will continue. More and more computers are going to sport dual-core processors, and you can enjoy it in your Power Mac now.Memory - This Power Mac G5 comes with 512 MB of memory. 512 MB of memory might be sufficient, for someone checking their email and browsing the web. However, obviously, buyers of the Power Mac are going to be power users, or at least multitask extensively. For that reason, the included 512 MB of memory is truly not sufficient. However, what's the great thing? This Power Mac supports up to a whopping 16 gigabytes of memory. Once you have your machine, simply pick up an affordable upgrade, from one of the trusted memory suppliers out there.Hard drive and optical drive - This Power Mac's hard drive is 160 GB. This would be plenty of space for many consumers, but there will be some power users who need more. Nevertheless, if you find yourself needing more space you can add a second hard drive to your system. The included optical drive is a 16x Superdrive, with double-layer burning support. What more do you need? Burn up to 8.5 GB of data, on a double-layer disk. Fantastic.Video Card - Apple is often given a hard time about providing what some consider less than the very top, when it comes to video cards. The card in this Mac is a NVIDIA GeForce 6600 LE with 128MB of GDDR SDRAM, one single-link DVI port, and one dual-link DVI port. This Power Mac provides significant features over the standard graphic card, in the previous low-end Power Mac. For example, you'll be able to connect an Apple 30-inch cinema display, plus you could connect a 20 or 23 inch cinema display next to that.Ports - You'll have the standard ports you'd expect on a Power Mac. Firewire 800, 2 Firewire 400, 4 USB 2.0, and 2 USB 1.1 on keyboard. When it comes to networking, Apple has provided 2 gigabit ethernet ports, so they really have you covered there. A Mighty Mouse and Apple Pro Keybaord are included in the box, both of which have a good feel to them.Mac OS X - If you're considering Macintosh for the first time, you're going to love the Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger. It is incredibly user friendly, and you'll quickly find the interface and design is saving you time. Furthermore, Mac OS X is much more secure than Windows, so you can put your mind at rest.iLife - Although many power and professional users of a Power Mac are going to be using his or her Mac, for a lot of professional work, with professional applications, Apple still includes iLife with every Mac. iLife can still be a great way to manage your personal digital life. Store and manage your digital images in iPhoto, jam to music in iTunes, create music in Garageband, and simple movies in iMovie.Furthermore, there are convenient applications built right into the operating system such as Dashboard, iCal (a great calendar that syncs up with your external devices including iPod), Dictionary, Expose, Stickies, DVD Player, and more.Overall, the newest Power Mac G5 is another phenomenal product, from Apple. You'll be impressed many times, when you use this Power Mac. You'll be impressed when you pull its stunning aluminum case out of the box, when you use it for the first time and witness its speed, and everyday as you come to appreciate the convenience and joy of owning a powerful machine like the Power Mac G5. Apple has improved upon the Power Mac in several areas, and quite simply, they give you more value, for your dollar. Enjoy the Power Mac.
This is item 29527 on CablesToGo's website (sorry, Amazon doesn't let me paste the link). The price on their website is $40, so here you are getting a good deal.This is a 24-pin male-male DVI-D digital cable. It's cheap and feels cheap, but delivers good performance. I use it to hook my Denon DVD-1910 DVI DVD player to my Syntax Olevia LCD TV. It can also hook to most other HDTVs, such as those made by Sharp, Pioneer, Panasonic, Toshiba, Hitachi, etc.Most HDTVs and DVI-capable DVD players have female connectors, so you need this M/M cable. But double-check your device to make sure.
I want to point out that you should never buy a generic battery, like the person from San Diego who reviewed the S410 on May 15, 2004, was recommending. Yes you'd save money, but there have been many reports of generic batteries exploding when charged for too long. And don't think if your generic battery explodes you can sue somebody and win millions. These batteries are made in sweatshops in China, India and Korea, and I doubt you can find anybody to sue. So play it safe, both for your own sake and the camera's sake. If you want a spare, get a real Canon one.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Sandisk 512MB Secure Digital Ultra II, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this 512MB card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
DYNEX USB 4-port CardThis PCI card has four external USB ports to supply or augment USB ports on a computer. USB 2.0 ports are used for digital cameras, memory card readers, mass storage devices, CD or DVD drives, video cameras, scanners, Iomega ZIP drives, and other devices. The computer mainboard must have support for USB devices (most do). Some older whitebox" computers may not have a USB port but can use a PCI card to provide them (adjust the BIOS parameters).The minimum system requirements are: a Pentium 133 MHz or faster; 64 MB RAM; a free PCI slot; CD or DVD reader; Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, or Vista. Since most printers use a USB port this device will be useful for an older computer that does not have a USB port, or one that needs extra USB ports.The "User Guide' explains how to install the UC104 card into a PCI slot. Windows XP and 2000 will simply install the needed drivers. For Windows Me and 98 you must use the drivers on the DX-UC104 CD (see pages 9 to 11). The unofficial upgrade to Windows 98SE has the drivers to support this card."
The SD110 is identical to the older SD100 model in every aspect, both technical specs and picture quality, except the SD110 model comes with the new PictBridge button, which gives you one-button printing to PictBridge-compatible photo printers. It's convenient if you never post-process your digital images, but I think most of us do perform some kind of enhancements like contrast adjustment and cropping. So it's better if you get the SD100 model for a lot less.I don't like the 2x optical zoom. Everyone else is doing 3x, why is Canon still giving us 2x on ultra-compacts?
One of the joys I have in my new role at OneCall_com is the ability to obtain product training directly from the manufacturers. This morning was one of the joyous times.I just about choked on my Denon supplied chocolate donut and orange juice when I saw the back of this receiver. It is a work of majesty and complicated, geeky beauty. It is the receiver of all receivers from Denon--and possibly anyone else. There is not one bell nor one whistle missing.However, the words that rang out loudly for me when the Denon National Sales Manager was speaking to us was, This product comes with 5 hours of product training. This product should only be sold in custom install situations. This product is not for the faint of heart. Everythign is assignable. It is a baby when it comes out of the box and has to be taught everything."People . . . know what you are purchasing before you buy this receiver. You will need to invest time into this receiver to understand it."
There is one feature on this device that makes it worth its price. The feature is the 2go feature. The 2go feature allows you to record up to 5 hours of XM radio play and then play it back at anytime and even in a missle bunker if you want (i.e. some place there would be no XM reception). The best part about the 2go feature though is that you can skip from song to song effortlessly (like changing songs on a CD player). This is wonderful because you can skip the songs you don't like and replay the ones you love.So how do I use my Delphi MyFi XM2go? I have it at work and before I leave each day I decide which station I want to listen to the next day and I set it to record the next 5 hours. When I come in the next morning my 5 hours of music is waiting for me. I then listen to what I want and skip over the things I don't replying the best of the best. Also, I am in a two story building on the first floor and using the supplied cradle and indoor XM antennae I get perfect reception.Here are the cons though . . . FM modulator is very weak. In both my Durango and my Viper I can't get a super clean signal (and I tried all frequencies), the Viper has no steel so the antennae won't stay anywhere (except the pedals or the gear shift which actually are steel--but neither are safe or pratical), and lastly it doesn't have the convenient mounting with power built in like the iPod has.Thoughts of XM as a whole, well good content but still really happy I can skip forward or backward with my device. I guess it is a lot like TiVo for the radio (why hasn't TiVo done that yet, now that would be nice).
Maxell manufactures excellent high grade six hour blank VHS tapes for better quality images than regular VHS tapes can pick up on, as well as all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have up to six hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording television shows, for example.In addition, you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time, four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording. (You use your VCR to set this.) The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they're satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of viewing enjoyment because you record onto them over and over again countless times although after some use the picture quality will eventually begin to gradually deteriorate. This is true even though these tapes are advertised as high grade."Unfortunately, these high grade tapes still cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a DVD-R onto another DVD-R instead of a Maxell blank VHS tape, the quality of the audio-visual media on the DVD-R copy would be sharper and clearer than a high grade Maxell tape or any other brand of video tape could give you. Moreover, VHS tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow front edge of each VHS tape which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The VHS tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable blank high grade VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record with a better quality image than standard blank VHS tapes can produce. I have used this brand for years and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell high grade six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape."
You can not evaluate the lens by just the numbers - yes, it is nearly identical to the factory lens, but it is a much faster lens and made in Japan, not China. Additionally it has a unique focus system that requires very little lens movement to go from 3 feet to infinity - this translates into RAPID focus - faster than the factory lens as well. It also features the mounting lugs and 62mm (as opposed to 58) filter threads to accept the ring flash as well as the twin flash accessories, so if you have expanded beyond the FL-50 - you DON'T want the factory lens any more. Taken together, this is the lens 70-80% of my shooting was done with. I am sold on the E300 and bought 3 backs cheap after they were obsoleted - I also bought 3 lenses, the 14-54, the 50mm macro, and the 50-200mm - each lens is on its own back eliminating the risk of contamination completely while giving me redundancy when I am away.After knowing you are going to take a picture, you narrow down to 2 questions as to which one.1 - you don't know much except you have a picture to take - use the 14-542 - you know it's going to be about 50mm and you want maximum detail or have poor lighting, or have a macro shot - then pick the 50 mm prime lens3 - it's a long distance shot - take the 50-200, add the teleconverter if needed.Simple!And for flash - long distances get the FL-50 - shorter get the ring or twin flash to even the lighting out. Forgot your flash? pop up the built in one!
This funky-looking TV-DVD-VCR combo from Panasonic is really pleasant to use. The 20&quot; TV screen is perfect for a SOHO or a small bedroom. Because it's a three-in-one, you can carry it to the kitchen or bathroom as well. The product feels solid and everything works as you'd expect.(Note: as with all DVD-VCR combos, you cannot tape Macrovision copy protection-enabled DVDs to a VHS.)I recommend you shop around as this particular model can be bought for way under $300, which makes it a good value and 5 stars-worthy.
Denon makes a lot of professional video equipment that costs tons of money, but this consumer-oriented DVD player, one of the few models on the market today that support DVI all-digital output, is both affordable and high-quality.A quick note: at least two other manufacturers (V! and Sansung) also have DVI-capable DVD players. But according to websites like extremetech, they give poor video output.Chances are, if you are reading this review, you probably already know what DVI is. For those that are new to the topic, DVI (digital video interface) is a true digital-only connection between a video source (e.g., DVD player) and a display. The signal that travels over the DVI cable is pure digital, as opposed to the analog signal over component, S-video and composite video cables. What does this mean? You get noise-free image on a DVI-capable TV set. Most namebrand HDTV sets now come with DVI input, e.g., Sharp, Panasonic, Pioneer, Sony, Hitachi.So, in order to take full advantage of this Denon player's digital output, you need an HDTV with a DVI connector. Once you couple the two together, you'll be amazed at the image quality. Not only is the DVI-driven video noise-free, but the image is also brigher. The Denon also features what's known as up-scalers". Since current DVD movies are *not* HD -- they are of the standard NTSC (or PAL, if you are in Asia or Europe) resolution -- the upscaler can magically make the DVD video appear HD. I don't know all the technical details of how this is done, but the upshot is, the image quality is improved and you'll be getting every bit of digital quality of your DVD movies.With some good DVD players selling for less than $50 -- e.g., my everyday DVD player is the $45 CyberHome slim-and-small progressive-scan player bought at Radio Shack -- is the Denon worth the extra money? The answer is a resolute yes, if you have a DVI-capable HDTV set. Seriously, if you have an HDTV, you *need* this player. Otehrwise you are not getting the best DVD playback. The Denon is actually a great buy, considering that the other DVI DVD players on the market today don't perform well. The Denon works, and works well. Any videophiles who lack the deep pocket of a professional or dedicated fanatic, should get this. Once you go DVI, you won't go back."
CAUTION: MAKE SURE YOUR COMPUTER CAN WORK WITH DVD+R MEDIA BEFORE BUYING THIS--SOME OLDER COMPUTERS MAY NOT RECOGNIZE THIS TYPE OF BLANK DVD MEDIAMemorex makes a very reliable blank DVD+R that can handle up to 4.7 GB of data. Moreover, these blank DVD+Rs are capable of recording data at speeds up to 16x. The data I record onto these lasts for years, proving the test of time. I have used these as data discs, discs to record video and discs to record video. Great!The DVD+R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your DVD+Rs that have data stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than 16x. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your DVD+R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the DVD+R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--and you wouldn't want that, now would you? If you need to label the discs, label its' jewel case using a post-it note.Overall, Memorex blank DVD+R discs store data reliably over the years and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at 16x.
Iomega ZIP 250 Parallel Port DriveThis device allows both storage and transfer and works on any bi-directional or EPP parallel port. For best results, you should run the Parallel Port Accelerator" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 250Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device. Most printers will operate from the printer port on the back. The 250 MB unit can read and write the more popular 100Mb disks as well.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn't work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letters assigned after the hard drives. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first ("daisy chaining"). This changes the drive letters assigned to CD-drives. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. A ZIP disk never has compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: "SCSI controllers", "Iomega", "Iomega Parallel Port Interface", then "Finish".You should set the Printer Port as EPP or ECP.Then modify the 'Settings' for the Iomega Parallel Port Interface as follows.The port settings assumes the usual I/O address.'My Computer'; 'Properties'; 'System Devices'; 'Device Manager';'SCSI Controllers'; 'Iomega Parallel Port Interface'; 'Properties'; 'Settings'/mode:eppecr /port:378 /speed:6"
The charger works perfectly. I was really surprised at how fast it got to me. Since I love going places, this will be handy. The price is right and would recommend this highly!
Plantronics, as you know, has made what most people feel are the best headsets on this planet and the moon since the 1960's. Their audio quality and understandibility is exceptional. So why not use yours with your PC. In fact, why not use it with your cellular phone? Well you can with the proper cable.The dual termination cable (mic/speaker) here allows you to plug your favorite plantronics headset into your PC and work with programs like skype, audio dictation software, etc. Using skype, people often comment to me that my phone sounds better" than my normal landline phone. The microphone element in plantronics products is superior to the carbon mic element found in most telephone sets. Naturally I sound better. Combined with the codec used on the pc and increased bandwidth the call quality is often limited by the PSTN connection on the other end. Skype to skype calls using plantronics headsets and this cordset sound like studio audio connections.I have also purchased their 2.5 mm connector to use my favorite headset with my cellphone due to changing laws in my state mandating the use of headsets. Personally I don't care much for the sound quality of bluetooth (even 2.0) - but plugging in the plantronics headset and suddenly people think I bought a new cellphone. I hate to tell them its the same phone I've always had, just using a headset that costs more than the phone itself.One bit of advice - unless you are in a terribly noisy area, you don't need the 2.5 mm amplifier from plantronics. These would be applicable to say construction sites or airlines, but in normal environments the plantronics speaker is more than adequate to reproduce the audio from most equipment. If you cell phone is weak in the audio area, you may wish to consider the 2.5mm amplifier, but it is by no means mandatory.Enjoy the flexibility to use one headset on your pc, your phone, and your cellphone - and sound great all the way."
After my disappointment with the Philips SBC HN100 noise cancellation headphones (see my review there), I picked up the Sennheiser HD-497 headphones. I hadn't used a pair of Sennheiser in a long time, but I do have excellent hearing and my musical training enables me to tell a good pair of headphones from a so-so and a bad pair. After breaking in the HD-497 I think this is a pair to keep, while I continue my search for an affordable noise-canceling set.The best feature of the HD-497 is the ultra-clear sound. I've hook the headphones up to my 600-watt amplifier from RCA, various models of Panasonic and Sony portable CD players, my Palms, my iPaq, my Initial portable DVD player. To my satisfaction, the HD-497 gives vibrant, clear sound on each one of the sources. It should be emphasized that the HD-497 does *not* enhance any particular range. If you are looking for a bass-boosting headset, for instance, you'll be sorely disappointed. For me, though, this is better, because I want &quot;high fidelity&quot; in its truest sense. Whatever audible range and texture that are recorded on the source (CD, DVD, MP3, etc.), should be preserved. And since many amplifiers and also software programs are better at allowing me to adjust the levels of the various frequencies, I'd prefer to use those to get the best sound, and I want my headphones to preserve those settings without any furthur, &quot;cheapo&quot; distortion. This is fundamentally different from purchasing a so-so pair of earphones and hoping to get some fake bass boost from them. I'm not saying the fake bass boost is necessarily a bad thing, though; sometimes, for example, when you are using a no-frills portable audio player, the bass boost in the headphones may make you happier. It's just that for me, the way the HD-497 preserves and passes through the output from my audio sources, greatly pleases the audiophile in me. Of course, this also means the HD-497 is best used with an audio source that allows you to make frequency response adjustments. My RCA Lyra MP3 jukebox does that, so I've been very happy with the Lyra-Sennheiser pairing.In terms of ergonomics, the HD-497 is far from perfect. It's still a bit too tight for my taste, especially because I wear glasses. On the packaging Sennheiser boasts of &quot;extremely comfort for extended listening.&quot; I beg to differ. After about 30 minutes I need to take it off for a break. But because the sound quality on this is so superb, I'm willing to accept a bit of discomfort. Besides, it's many times more comfortable than my old Koss over-ear headphones.The padded headphones help keep some noise out, but not very much. It probably doesn't even qualify for a passive noise cancellation system, so if you take this on a plane or Amtrak you may be disappointed. On the other hand, it gives you beautiful sound and plenty of volume (no inline volume control, though), so you should be able to find a volume level on your audio source that will effectively cancel out ambient noise.As for portability, the HD-497 is too big for stuffing it in a pocket, or a ladies' purse. The person who said this was too big for his/her carry-on luggage wasn't being accurate. You can put this away in a carry-on, or just hang them around your neck. In fact, it's quite stylish. :)
I bought my Wolverine at different stages, starting with the smallest disk (80 GB) and then adding the dock, charger, extra battery, remote, etc. So now I've bought into the system - for a good reason - it's a great system!I use mine as a PVR now. I just got back from a 15 day cruise where the wolverine was used to transfer 26+ GB of data out of my 3 cameras into its storage, which was then moved to my laptop and burned onto dvds.(the reason for the extra backup insurance was that TSA had been rumored to be confiscating DVDs, laptops, among other things from people returning from overseas checking for copyright infringement and other nasties. I did not want them taking my 26 GB of pictures so they were smuggled" in on the Wolverine as well as the PC and DVDs burned on the way)The wolverine performed exceptionally well which is why I decided to expand on the system and buy a 2nd battery plus the dock and dedicated battery charger, which was very useful onboard a cruise ship where you only have 2 outlets.As a PVR the dock gives you every cable you need (female RCA and male RCAs) along with instant compatibility. I use a separate tuner for HDTV so the dock is attached to it for recording SDV video like the evening news that I can scan through later saving me time.Finally - if 80 GB seems small (I have not yet filled mine but its getting up there) keep in mind that you are allowed to open your wolverine, install a new disk like the 160GB - 180GB or whatever size emerges in 2.5" down the road, press a button and have a brand new system with as much as 200 GB of storage.Knowing that made me comfortable buying into the PVR system, along with the display that is big enough to actually watch, and cf/sd card read/write ability. My Wolverine was used in at least 3 ways every day of my vacation and gets used daily at home as well. I also do not own a tivo, so I justified buying into the dock by not buying into the Tivo. As for return on investment - the Wolverine is doing far more than I could hope for. The Tivo is nice, but lacks Wolverine's added functionality. I did build my own HDTV PVR since nobody else would, and once again the Wolverine + dock handles my standard definition PVR usage along with portability. I also use it to catch up on HDTV shows shrunk down to its screensize.You won't regret the dock's convenience - and it's a fun way to grab the remote and strike up a conversation with Ipod owners about features they may see in a few versions of the ipod. Oh yes - once docked your Wolverine charges - regardless of how the dock is powered (USB or wallwart) - versitile and transparent to the end user."
Update 12/2008When I wrote this review your choices were the fl-50 or the 36 which made the choice simple. Today the 50R is an option that alot of people are going to evaluate. I own both units and here's what I can tell you to help decide between the 50 / 50R flashesThe 50R is an advanced 50 designed for the E3. It has alot of extra features that even non olympus owners can use. It will operate as a remote flash / flood light and trigger by the initial flash of the first camera, no matter what it is.In another mode of operation, the 50R can be told" to participate in one of 3 groups of flashes by the E3. The intensity of each group can be varried in the E3 flash setup menu. The 50R has a second mode that will listen to the E3's special signal which is sent ONLY by using the internal flash on the E3.Finally the 50R can be put on the hotshoe on many cameras. Even on the hotshoe of an E3, the 50R can NOT talk to other 50Rs set to the remote program listening mode, so you MUST use the E3's internal flash to trigger the 50R with the custom programming mode. The 50R can ALWAYS act as a supplemental flash.Finally, the 50R includes a couple nice gifts in the package - they have a diffuser cup that snaps over the 50R as well as a plastic version and rubber snap that is an elegant solution to the photographer's 3x5 card and rubber bands trick for light direction. It is a white plate and a rubber strap and hook. The last of 3 gifts is a base that the 50R slides into and locks in place to act as a foot. This allows it to operate off camera for fill flash applications easily.In summary the 50R is the more modern solution, while the 50 will work with alot of olympus cameras. Technically the 50 is obsolete, while the 50R has many extra options.(original review follows below - its dated - be sure to read my 50R review separately before you purchase a FL-50x flash. If you have an E3 - DO NOT BUY THIS FLASH - buy the FL-50R - even if you think you may upgrade to an E3 someday. The remainder of this review applies to the FL-50R as well)---end update--- 12-2008If you have read this far on the FL-50 you should also read my review on the FP-1 (search for olympus fp-1) - it is a side grip designed to go with the fl-50 and speed up it's cycle time.By now you know the FL-50 is the flagship flash from Olympus - but there's more you should know about this particular flash.First - there are 4 exra pins in a row under a rubber cover. 2 of them bring in 6V regulated (as in 6.000 volts) and the other two, well upwards of 300 volts for charging the main cap come in on those pins using a special signalling system spoken by the HV-1 (I believe) High Voltage adapter (more later)Second - The FL-50 is also the basis for the twin flash and ring flash controller. A few things get changed - the red lens is blacked out because the other flashes (at least the ring flash) have modeling lights so you can focus and see where the flash "star" or "blast" will end up in your photo (or even get it out of your photo!)That is NOT to say that you can unhook your flashtube from your FL-50 and make a ring flash controller - its simply that the plastic and controls and LCD will be very familiar to you if you get a macro flash later in life (None of the "up top" flashes work well when your subject is inches from the lens filter)More on the HV-1. Hidden deep inside the FL-50's "brain" is a remarkable ability to parallel process with the OLY HV-1 supply. What makes the HV-1 soo good? Well, first off, it's got a 2700 mAh battery pack. -- you say, well - I can put 2700 mAh nimh cells in the FL-50 -- I fully encourage you do do that as well. The FL-50 holds 4 2700 mah cells. The HV-1 starts off with 6, giving it a 50% voltage boost, plus the current boost on top of that. In other words, the HV-1's battery supply is really heavy duty compared to what you can do with 4 AA nimh cels.Now here's the best part!FL-50 w/ 4 2700 NIMH AA cells - full recharge - about 6 or 7 secondsFL-50 w/ HV-1 and EMPTY battery compartment on the FL-50, same conditions - 1 sec.FL-50 w/ HV-1 and those 2700 mah NIMH batts inside it - &lt; 1 sec rechargeIn other words, the FL-50 will use BOTH its internal inverter and the HV-1 as a pair to recharge as fast as possible. (oh yea - and we know with such a huge capacitor as the FL-50 that we're not going to empty it every time, so its more likely the recharge times are fractions of a second.)And now we put all the above together. Our best 2700 mah AA cells - the HV-1 adapter (which also works on the ring flash and twin flash and modeling lights) - we set the "MODE" switch on our Evolt cameras to sports mode, turn the flash on - guess what happens!If you are just using the flash for fill - it can keep up with the sports shooting rate! I used a sandisk 4GB E-III 133x card, a compressed picture, and pow-pow-pow-pow-pow it kept firing as long as I held down the shutter. At ISO 100. Inside. Natural light.So to sum it up - if you are content to wait for the flash to cycle, or shoot those shaky 1 second exposure pictures, forget the FL-50 and HV-1 system. Just get a FL-36 and you'll save alot of $. But - IF - and only if - you think you are headed for a flash __SYSTEM__ then start it with the FL-50. You can by the HV-1 later (I did) - and then when you get some good lenses and you want a ring flash for up close and even modeling work, all your flash parts will work together! You will own not just a speedlight but a portable studio strobe - with TTL metering - and you'll never go anywhere without the HV-1 / FL-50 combination. With 10 cells charging your battery instead of 4 you flash takes on a new personality."
This battery is long-lasting and charge very fast! I bought 2 of it for my Canon camera. Both of it works well!
This is a nice, fast 50mm lens, great for portraits. High-quality construction and excellent optics, all for a great price.But digital SLR shooters should be aware. Most Nikon d-SLRs have a focal length factor, usually of 1.5x, so this lens is effectively a 75mm lens on the likes of D70, etc. It's still good for portraits -- in fact, a little telephoto helps portrait shooting -- but if you want a totally normal lens (45mm-55mm), this is not the one to get. Try something with a marked focal length of 35mm or so, for an effective focal length in the normal range.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Delkin Devices 64MB ATA TYPE 1, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

I've slammed the earlier version of this device (the m125) for its SMALL SCREEN, but adding color (and TFT at that) and rechargeable lithium battery are significant improvements that puts this unit into the realm of contenders.However, keep in mind that this is still a compromise unit, with several drawbacks relative to the higher-priced m515, or to the color Clie models.The m130 is functionally identical to the m105 (which costs about half), with the exception of an expansion slot that you will probably never use, a faster processor, a fast USB cradle,a couple of software doodads, and now the color screen and rechargeable battery.If you want the cheapest PALM-branded model with color and expansion capabilities, then the m125 is it. (You can get a used color IIIc model for a lot less, check around).This model is still plagued by a small screen, and it's low-res at that.With the built-in difficulty of pointing and clickin on a Palm device, size matters. But the color makes it far easier to see, so it's a trade-off.The color Visor Prism has significantly greater screen real estate.If you want to stay with Palm, consider the Palm m515. It comes in a super-slim package with a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery and a full-size screen (although low-res).In that price range, however, a Pocket PC might make more sense (Palm still can't compete with the gorgeous iPaq active color screens).Here's a basic product guide:Palm m100/Handspring Visor -- Bargain basement models with 2 MB of Ram. Good starter models for the price. Distinguishing characteristics: Visor has significantly larger screen/expansion slot and fast USB cradle. Palm has slower serial.Palm m105/Visor Deluxe/Visor Neo -- Workhorse models with 8 MB of Ram (plenty for monochrome models). Visor has bigger screen/USB/expansion slot. Neo has faster processor.Palm m125/Visor Platinum/Visor Pro -- Upper middle class models. Visor has larger screen. Both have USB/expansion slot.Palm Vx -- Classic, not significantly expandable. Smallest full-function PDA with lithium rechargeable battery. Sharp, full-size mono screen.Visor Edge/Clie slimline -- ultraslim mono models sell at a premium.Palm m130 -- Fills consumer color niche. Compare to color Clie models, Visor Prism. Small, bright screen, rechargeable battery, expandable.Palm m515 -- top of the line. Screen is now brighter, 16 mb included, now we want higher resolution. Still, a great improvement over the horrible washed-out color on the Palm m505. Compare with top Sony models/iPaq.Enjoy!
Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch. That all changed in January 2006, with the introduction of Intel processors inside Macintosh computers.Processor in the new Mac MiniThis particular Mac Mini features an intel Core Duo processor, which is Intel's latest technology. The power of two processor cores, on a single die. Amazing performance. The Duo takes computing to another level. It has blown me away. There is a gigantic increase in performance over the G4, which was previously included with the Mac Mini. The Mac Mini Core Duo can even play 1080p H264 videos, which the Mac Mini G4 could only dream about doing.Design - The Mac Mini is beautiful. I just love looking at this computer. One of the most beautiful computer form factors ever. You will immediately notice how nicely Apple packages the computer, in an impossibly small box. It may be a small form factor, but it has a lot of features. There are plenty of ports too: 4 USB 2.0 ports, 1 Firewire 400 port, DVI Video out, Audio In, Audio Out.Video Card -The new Mac Mini has Intel integrated graphics, which isn't usually a great feature. However, it is still a step-up from the graphics on the previous Mac Mini. The graphics on this machine supports Core Image technology, which the previous Mini did not. It does share your system's memory, for video memory, which is even more of a reason why you should upgrade this system's memory.Video - The Mac Mini includes a DVI-output connector on the back, which can also output VGA, with the included adapter. An analog video out adapter is also available, separately. The DVI and VGA connectors will allow you to connect the Mini to virtually any display.Memory - The Mac Mini has a very capable processor, but you may not realize its full potential with the limited memory in the machine, 512 MB. Consider upgrading your memory, once your machine arrives. Other World Computing and Crucial are two companies that sale memory, with online selector tools to easily find the right kind.Applications -Apple does include iLife '06, which has iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and Garageband. There is the Safari web browser, some board games, the always useful iCal, AddressBook, iChat, etc. Overall, I was pleased with the included software.iLife 06 is particularly great. I love the new full-screen photo editing, photo comparing, etc. You can now also order calendars and greeting cards made with your photos, direct from Apple, by using the iPhoto software. iMovie has new themes, which helps make professional-looking home movies, and iDVD now supports widescreen DVDs. iWeb is a brand-new applications, which makes it easy to create professional quality webpages, quickly. I can't wait to rebuild by site using iWeb. Apple continues to make it easy to create music, manage your digital images, make movies, and create web sites. This Mac Mini can even burn dual-layer DVDs.A trial (30 day) of iWork '06 is also included, which includes the page layout program Pages, and the presentation program Keynote (which makes presentations that blow away presentations made by rival PowerPoint).Hard Drive-This Mac Mini supports a 80 GB hard drive, which will be sufficient for a lot of people. You can certainly hold a lot of documents and music on it. However, you won't fit much video.Super Drive-The Super Drive in this Mac Mini will allow you to burn music and data CDs, plus watch and burn DVDs. You can even burn dual-layer DVDs!PowerPC Applications on Intel MachineIf you own a lot of software for Mac, then most of it is probably compiled for PowerPC. Developers are working hard to make titles run natively on both Intel and PowerPC, but many titles are not yet ready. However, many titles you can use on an Intel Mac because Apple has included Rosetta, which translates the PowerPC code into something the Intel machine can read. However, you never see Rosetta for it works quietly in the background and makes running PowerPC applications seamless. Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta. Intensive applications such as Photoshop will run under Rosetta, but it will be slower until Adobe has an Intel compiled version of Photoshop. Rosetta does work and if you add memory to your Mac, Rosetta works even better.Two titles I use EyeTV and Toast 7 are not yet compiled for Intel, but they run fine on my Intel Mac, under Rosetta. Again, you don't have to open anything special to use Rosetta. Your Mac knows when it needs it and uses it.Wireless - This Mac Mini includes bluetooth and Airport wireless technologies, standard. Connect wireless keyboards, mice with Bluetooth, and log-onto the Internet with Airport.Overall, I am blown away by the Mac Mini Core Duo. It should perhaps come with more memory standard, but it is a very impressive machine. It is incredibly fast on Intel-native applications, and it does a very good job running PowerPC applications. The Intel machines are the future of Apple, so there is no question this is a good machine, and this one has enough power to get most tasks completed in a very speedy manner. I'm happy with my Intel Mac, and I look forward to continue exploring it in the coming days
Cool running unit! Internal fan makes it run cooler, no screws needed for future upgrade. This unit is designed for vertical or horizontal use.

Sony makes a very reliable blank DVD-R that can handle up to 4.7 GB of data. Moreover, these blank DVD-Rs are capable of recording data at speeds up to 16x. The data I record onto these lasts for years, proving the test of time. I have used these as data discs, discs to record video and discs to record audio. Great!The DVD-R discs are compact and easy to store, although I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your DVD-Rs that have data stored on them. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than 16x. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your DVD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the DVD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--and you wouldn't want that, now would you? If you need to label the discs, label its' jewel case using a post-it note. At least that's what I do.Overall, Sony blank DVD-R discs store data reliably over the years and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at 16x.Use them in good health!

This number 22 tri-color ink cartridge by Hewlett Packard is an essential for those of us who use the HP Deskjet D1430 printer--or any other printer that accepts this cartridge.The three colors of yellow, red and blue (well, maybe it's a bluish-green) can be combined by the printer to produce a wide array of other colors very effectively. The cartridge takes up little space if you care to stock up on them and it comes well packaged so that it won't break during shipment. Moreover, the installation and removal of the cartridge is very easy so when changing the ink cartridge you will rarely have any difficulty.If you care to save some money you can buy this ink cartridge in the same package as a black ink HP 21; this would be even more cost-efficient. The ink goes faster than you would think it would go!Overall, the quality of the ink is rather good despite my one complaint that the ink goes faster than I would like it to go. The cartridge provides you with the ability to print a multitude of colors on your paper and replacement is easy.
The SR-SP7 portable speakers from Sony are cheap for a reason: they are &quot;passive,&quot; meaning they do not use any power to amplify the sound output from your audio source. You can plug the pair in to any portable audio sources, like CD discman, MP3 player, portable DVD player, etc. Because the speakers do not have a built-in amplifier, the sound, albeit stereo, is quite soft and if you use them in a noisy environment, e.g., commuter train, you won't be happy. I personally use them for my audio books on weekends, when I take them to my local Dunkin Donuts and hook them up to my Panasonic CD/MP3 player and then enjoy the audio books while sipping my large DD coffee. These speakers do not need batteries or AC adapter, so they are very portable, and also look cool.
I use this cloth to clean my eyeglasses ever since I needed new lenses that are quite strong; using a soft cloth always left a type of residue that made it look as if my lenses had fogged up! The cloth is indeed washable many times over; it doesn't fall to pieces in the wash; and I really like that I can use this same cloth to clean my LCD monitor and my digital camera lens. Amazingly enough, there's no need for this cloth to be moistened before you use it--it really does the job as it is, dry and with a gentle swipe across the surface that you wish to clean.My only caveat is that when you use this to clean anything you might want to first blow or gently brush off heavier particles of dirt or dust. That way you avoid making any marks on the lens after you use this cloth to clean something. Another reviewer notes that if you have a water spot you may need to apply a little bit of cleaner before using this cloth.I recommend this product.
This is the best multi-flash memory card reader, and it has a great price to boot. A memory card reader basically connects to your PC's USB port, and you can insert a flash memory card into the reader, just like you used to insert a floppy into a floppy drive. Then the flash memory shows up as an external drive on your Windows Explorer.The Zio accepts the following 10 formats:1.CompactFlash Type I2.CompactFlash Type II3.xD4.IBM Microdrive (really a CF II card)5.SmartMedia6.Memory Stick7.Magic Gate Memory Stick8.Memory Stick PRO9.MultiMediaCard10.Secure Digital (SD is the most popular format right now)I've used flash cards with up to 512MB with no problems, on an XP laptop.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Verbatim 64MB Secure Digital Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I don't own the Apple Nano. My friend does and I used it enough to write an Amazon review about it.Sound Quality: The sound quality was not as good as on my iRiver (my i had more clarity and a little more bass response), but the difference isn't even noticeable unless your obsessive-compuslive about sound. There is a custom EQ along with some presets to match what genre of music you like. I've never seen the Apple earbuds but most people say they are awful so you should probably pick up some better earbuds or headphones (the ones I have are the Panasonic RPHJE50's and my friend's are the cheaper Sony MDRJ10's if that helps you on your search).Interface: Well, I must say I'm impressed. I will say that it's much easier to use than most MP3 players on the market (the iPod's interface is really the whole reason they are so popular). The artists, albums, genres, and titles are set up like most, in category forms so you can find your song. Note that 500 songs (128 kbps, trust me don't go any lower) is around 40 albums, so I would recommend stepping up to the 4 GB Nano which will hold 1,000 songs/80 albums. The software the Nano uses is iTunes (which most people are familiar with). It does pretty much any function Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or MusicMatch would do. It's easy to create playlists on iTunes and send them into your player.Features: The Apple Nano has some features, even though it's somewhat lacking. One of the best features is it's size. This thing is small, only 3.5 x 1.6 x 0.27 inches and only weighs 1.5 ounces. The player does display album art, most MP3 players will not do that. It has a nice 1.5-inch color display and a photo viewer. It works with most OSs, even my friend got it to work on Windows 98. Some websites will podcast and you can put casts on your Nano. The Nano has some nice features, however, some of the features are lacking. The battery life is only 14 hours while most MP3 players are more than this. It charges and syncs with one USB, which means you have to take both along if you have to charge it. Hopefully your computer has a USB port in the front like me, that way you won't have much of a hassle. There is no FM tuner/recording but most people don't need that feature, however I think it should be deserved for the high cost.Durability: The durability is much better than an iPod. I've heard batterys are fine on the Nano unlike iPods. It seems pretty durable, though I would highly recommend getting a case AND a rubber thing for it for two reasons. 1) It scratches very easily, both the plastic and the LCD. 2) The Nano will probably break if you drop it on concrete or the road.Price: Just in my opinion, the price is way too high for just a 2 GB MP3 player. I think Apple is just asking for too much. I know it's small, but that still doesn't balance the price.Overall: The Apple 2 GB Nano is a treat anyone would enjoy. Though the price is high and it doesn't have a radio or a record feature, it's good because of its size and its ease of use. 4 stars.
I like these headphones. I'll break them down best and worst.Pros:- Long cord which can be helpul at times.- Durable/You can count on Sony.- Great for sound. Good bass and treble.- Great for traveling.Cons:- Long cord which can also be a pain at times.- Somewhat uncomfortable.- (not really a con but a comment) Why do they say studio monitor at the top of the headphones?Pros - 4Cons - 2Pros are 4/6 = 67%4 starsSo, they aren't excellent, but they are good. Worth getting them if you want hi-fi or they look good to you. Though, I think the HD-202 and the UR15C headphones better. If you're really picky about comfort, I get one of the two I just said.P.S. COMFORT TIP-Take off the earform things. They feel fine, but you may want to put something on them afterwards.
It has a higher capacity than the one that came with the printer and it yields good, clean printing.
The Casio EX-Z55 is especially notable for two salient features not found in other ultra-compact, ultra-thin digital cameras:1) A *huge* 2.5 LCD screen (vs. 2" on the slightly cheaper Z50). You probably have seen labels on other tiny cameras that claim "large 1.8-in LCD." Well, this tiny Z55 has a whopping 2.5" (diagonal) screen which is almost twice as big as the 1.8" ones.2) Incredible battery life for such a small camera. Casio rates this at 400 pictures using some industry standard measurement (called "CIPA"). In comparison, the Canon SD300 is rated at 140, the Pentax Optio S5i at 160, and the Panasonic DMC-FX7 (with vibration reduction) at 120. I have not measured real-world battery life since I didn't have the camera for long, but I took over 200 pictures (about 1/4 with flash and all with the LCD on) and there was still plenty of juice left.Unlike many ultra-compacts, this camera does have an optical viewfinder, albeit a tiny one. If you want to prevent blurry pictures, you may want to use the optical viewfinder more, as holding the camera close to your face helps steady your shots.Now, what about the Picture Quality?First, as I always tell people: be realistic in your expectations. This is a very small camera, which means it has a very small lens (and aperture) and a very small sensor inside. The law of physics simply cannot be defied. The guy who owns a Canon EOS Digital Rebel of course complains about the picture quality of this Casio; it's like you own a Ferrari Enzo and then tries to expect the same performance from a Toyota Corolla. No matter how refined the Corolla is, it simply does not have the same power or performance as the Enzo, simply because it's in a different class, intended for a different audience, and has a much smaller engine.Digital SLRs such as the Nikon D70 and Canon EOS Digital Rebel are large and expensive for a reason: they are designed to wrestle the best performance out of digital sensors (CCD or CMOS). The Casio EX-Z55, like other ultra-compacts, is designed to be pocketable (even in a shirt). Cameras like this simply cannot take ultra-sharp pictures; their tiny lenses simply won't allow that.OK, enough philosophizing. The Casio is best for casual shots. You know, the shots at a party or club, the candid shots of kids and pets, the family shots at the local park or zoo. This is a take-anywhere-shoot-anywhere camera. It's even pretty fast in starting up so you can just take it out, turn it on, and shoot. It's best used as a point-and-shoot (also known as an idiot's camera).If you compare the Casio's picture quality vis-a-vis that of the Pentax Optio S5i or Canon SD300, you'll see it holds up pretty well. In fact, I would say for this tiny amazing thing, the picture quality is pretty high. The picture is a little on the soft side, but that can be sharpened in most image editing packages. If your intention is to make prints, the picture quality is sufficient, esp. after you apply a little bit of sharpening. Let me put this way: for most casual shots (which is what we consumer photographers do anyway), the Z55's picture quality does not disappoint.But don't take my word for it. Hop over to Best Buy or Circuit City or Radio Shack and take a look at this amazing camera yourself. If you want a pocketable camera with good picture quality and amazing battery life and a large, impressive LCD, the EX-Z55 should be your top choice."
I bought this CD player because I needed one. This was the cheapest high-quality brand I could find. It's a pretty good player. It has all of the functions most players have (play, plause, rew, ff, back track, forward track, repeat, 50-track programming, scan, and random play). Sound is okay but the bass boost is awful, it doesn't make much of a difference. The side buttons are easy to use which are ESP off/on, mode (to switch your play mode), digital volume, a headphone jack, and the open button. I find it somewhat odd that Philips placed the open button on the right. The hold button is on the back side. The AC adapter plug is on the top. The headphones had good sound but they were not durable; they broke in only a week. There is a battery indicator as well on the screen which seems pretty accurate to me. I don't like that whenever you turn the player off then back on the volume and bass boost settings are changed. The player shuts off when you open the lid, kinda useless but it may be helpful for some. The CD player feels very durable but it weighs a whole lot more than the similar priced Sony player (though I avoided it because the Amazon rating doesn't look too good). All in all, you should be fairly happy with your purchase.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk SDSDH-256-901 Secure Ultra 256MB, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

This 32 Aquos model is more expensive than another 32" Aquos model because this one has a built-in HDTV tuner. If you don't want the hassle of another device on your desk, this may be worth the extra money. But I'd go with the cheaper model, esp. considering HDTV is still a maturing standard and HDTV services such as VOOM come with the right tuner.Otherwise, both Aquos sport the same top-quality, 5th-generation LCD panel made by Sharp. This is the highest-rated panel in the industry. Not only great specs in terms of contrast and brightness, but in actual viewing you'll find the screen a high performer in areas such as black levels where most other LCDs fall short."
The Denon DVD-755S model is identical to the Denon DVD-1910, except the 755S is silver and the 1910 is black. I have a review of the 1910 which applies equally to the 755S, since internally the two models are totally the same. (They even share the same user's manual.)
The Komodo series has a few variations, but all employ high-quality LCD panels. The X9g-Komodo II (X9=19 diagonal, II=variation II of the Komodo serise) has a very nice panel (possibly made by Fujitsu) that's capable of 1280x1024 resolution and 16.7 million colors. The backlighting is very even, and at the max setting (25), too bright for most settings. I set it at 13, with contrast around 15 (out of 25), and it still looks bright in my office. No dead pixels on my unit.Not all the Komodo models have the digital DVI connector. If you need DVI, be sure to get the right variation.In summary, like other Sceptre offerings, the X9g-Komodo offers excellent image quality for a low price that's hard to beat. Very highly recommended."
I bought this to extend my prosine 1000W inverter's display 25 feet from the inverter to keep tabs on the power and battery voltage inside. It's great. Here's what you'll like.Instead of a male-male cable with a female-female adapter to make an extension this is a male-female 4 wire extension. 25 feet per cable - add em up as long as you need to go.Works with phone, digital phones, and even control panels for sinewave inverters - anything that uses 4 wire telephone jacks and is too short.great price too -- cheaper than the rat shack.
TDK manufactures excellent six hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have up to six hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording television shows, for example.In addition, you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time, four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording. (You use your VCR to set this.) The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they're satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of viewing enjoyment because you record onto them over and over again countless times although after some use the picture quality will eventually begin to gradually deteriorate.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a DVD-R onto another DVD-R instead of a TDK blank VHS tape, the quality of the audio-visual media on the DVD-R copy would be sharper and clearer than a TDK tape or any other brand of video tape could give you. Moreover, VHS tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow front edge of each VHS tape which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The VHS tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable blank VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record. I have used this brand for many years and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape.
I was at the #1 retail computer store the other week searching the aisles for the best DVD burner available. I have a burner for my computer (which by the way a computer burner is much quicker and provides much greater flexibility) but needed one to record programs from TV without having to change the entire world to accomplish it (i.e. new video card, find a way to get my dish setup to the computer, etc.). I figured that a component DVD burner would be the way to solve this. I was right!!Yes it is pricey. $700 for a burner is insane. However considering that this player will allow you to burn in any format you wish including to the hard disk drive (HDD) if you wish makes this unit a gem. I had the entire season of Smallville on my TiVo box (integrated box with DirecTV so no integrated burner or ability to connect to USB) and I had promised my cousin Ryan that I would get him the episodes he missed via DVD. I also had another friend of mine in DC that needed a few episodes as well. Here is the trick. One needed it in DVD-R and the other needed them in DVD+R (when will format wars end??). I first burnt the episodes to the hard drive and then burnt them at 4x speed to the DVD-R and then to the DVD+R. I could have burnt them faster had I bought the more expensive 8x disks but didn't know that at the time of purchase. The DVDs came out flawlessly and even have chapter markings every 6 minutes for easy navigation forward and backward through episodes. I could have set the chapters myself if I had wished (like right at end of the commercials) but didn't want to take the man hours to do all of that. I also removed the commercials flawlessly from a few of the episodes (but got tired of spending the man hours eventually).I have this burner connected to my Sony 36 Wega HD TV and it has a beautiful picture. I have DirecTV w/ TiVo so I do not use the TV Guide function.I hope this review was helpful to you in deciding whether the extra couple hundred bucks for this burner is worth it."
I really like this clock - not enough to earn the coveted 5 star rating, but enough to give it 4/5 stars (it's too plasticy - and the plastic has too much regrind in it to keep it servicable for many years). I loaded mine with 2 ea of the AAA lithium cellsEnergizer Ultimate L92BP-4 Lithium AAA Battery 4 Packso that it would run for a LONG time, and it has.The radio is surprisingly good at pulling in distant stations, however it lacks any sort of output jack to make better sound quality and uses a simple transistor radio style tuner - those went out in 1975 along with the boombox, but if you need an fm radio quick it will do thhe job.The lcd display is quite large once it pops up and the button can be used to light it with a yellow LED, making it great for dark nights.The clock/radio is quite thin and can be set to buzz, activate the radio, or do nothing when the alarm strikes.Things I like - radio sensitivity on am and fmThings I don't like - no ability to do 24 hour time (eg 4PM is 1600 hours) - it shows up in the display as 4p:15 for 4:15 in the afternoon.Overall it's more than what I'd expect for the price, and the night light/snooze button makes it readable if I wake up at night.
The case perfectly fits my ipod. Don't have to worry about the iPod video getting scratched or crushed. Great product with great price!
I simply love the Canon CanoScan 4200F flat scanner for prints and films. It's fast (both in scanning and transfering to the PC), quiet, and has superb scan quality, esp. on 35mm negatives. (I haven't tried scanning 35mm slide films.)Setting the 4200F up is pretty much a breeze, assuming you have Windows XP. (Windows 98 users will need to follow the instructions very carefully.) You first install the software -- the scanner driver and the scan toolbar (called toolbox") are the only programs necessary for using the scanner; the other applications (photo editing, OCR and Adobe Acrobat) are optional. After restarting your machine (so the scanner driver loads and runs as a service), just connect the USB 2.0 hi-speed cable, and you are set to go.Using the scanner is also quite simple. You can scan in three ways: directly from your photo organizing or editing program (assuming it supports the universal TWAIN interface, which most imaging programs worth their pennies do); using the Canon Scan Toolbox; or pressing one of the four buttons on the scanner itself, which calls up the toolbox and automatically initiates a scan.The four buttons are:- Copy. Your PC must be connected to a powered-on printer for this to work. When you press copy, the Canon scans and sends the file directly to your printer.- Scan. This is the button for scanning. When you press it, the Canon scans and sends the scanned image to your designated photo editing program, which you specify once via the toolbox. (This button corresponds to the "Scan 1" icon on the toolbox.)- PDF. This turns the scanned image into a PDF file.- E-mail. This button scans and then calls up Outlook Express or Outlook with the image embedded as a JPEG attachment.The toolbox (toolbar) has more options for scanning. All are pretty straightforward. Each option can be configured in detail, or you can specify that all the settings be done in the driver itself. (The toolbox is simply an interface to the driver.) If you configure things in the driver, you'll even be able to adjust how the scanned image should look, in terms of color, contrast, sharpness, etc., etc. The options are endless, but in the beginning, using the toolbox makes scanning a breeze and less intimidating.One thing cool about the Canon is how it makes it easy to understand what resolution you should scan in. First, the 4200F is capable of 3200x6400 dpi (dots per inch). The 3200 dpi is its true optical resolution; that's how much fine details it can detect. The second number, 6400 dpi, refers to its "stepping" levels, which basically means the sensor can sample each inch 6400 times, but only detects up to 3200 dots. When you scan, the Canon asks you what *output* resolution and size you want, and then calculates the necessary input resolution for you. Say you are scanning a 4x6" photo but want to be able to print it 4 times as large (or twice the width and length, i.e., 8x12") and print at 300 dpi. The Canon will then automatically set the correct scan resolution of 600 dpi -- which is twice as much as printing 4x6 at 300 dpi. So you'll get a 2400x3600 file in pixels, which can then be printed at 8x12" at 300 dpi (2400/8=3600/12=300dpi). This concept of specifying output resolution rather than worrying about input resolution works esp. well for scanning negatives. Say you are scanning a 35mm negative. It'd be a pain to figure out which scanning resolution is best. But if you know you'd eventually want to print a 4x6" photo in 200 dpi, just tell the driver so, and the driver will do all the work for you and scan properly.Another feature I love is multi-scan, which lets you scan in several pictures at once and the driver automatically separates them. Here's how I use my 4200F:I set up the scan button so it's linked to Adobe Photoshop Elements 3's organizer. (You can link the button to any TWAIN-compatible program.) When I press the button, the scanner automatically scans multiple pictures I place on the glass, and separates them (and straightens them if necessary) into individual pictures. I have a checkbox called "confirmation of EXIF" checked, which allows me an opportunity to scan in more pictures before sending them all at once to Photoshop Elements 3. This really saves me a lot of time, without having to switch between the scanner driver and Photoshop Elements after each scan. Finally, when I'm done with scanning all the photos, I click the Forward button, and the driver automatically launches Adobe Photoshop Elements (if it's not already open) or switches to it, and sends over the newly scanned pictures. This process works equally well for photo prints and negatives. It sounds longer than it actually is. As with any scanning, it's replacing the photos on the glass or in the negative holder that is the most time-consuming part.Compared to my previous scanners and even many more expensive scannesr on the market today, the CanoScan 4200F is lightyears ahead in scan quality, speed and quietness. The driver software has both a "simple mode" for easy scanning and an "advanced mode" for more fine-tuned scanning. The driver has been totally stable. I simply love this scanner. Finally, I will be able to scan in all my old photos.The only downside I can think of is the lack of a printed user's manual. The 4200F comes with a quick-start guide that covers installing the software and doing a test scan. The HTML user's guide has lots of details, but because it's not PDF, it's almost impossible to print out."
No way would someone purchase this as a home integrated dvd amplifier, mainly because the dvd drive is a pc drive stuck in the case with a very small hard to read lcd. It's packed with a good dozen or so indicators on it, and the IR remote is one of those $3 deals that only works if aimed dead on into the machine.btw - the dvd has video and audio outputs plus s-video. Once you program it with a remote control it is a good asset.On the good side it has plenty of inputs (2 mic and 1 aux/line level) to connect to the pbx's page out function and on the back has a 12VDC backup power source plus ac along with the 70V line transformer tap to drive the paging speakers. I do wish it would kill the music on hold when a page is sent through.There it lacks a little at 120 watts but we only have 12 speakers at 5 watts and a lab speaker at 20 watts which is only 80 watts, so it is enough to drive the load in our smallest office.pet peves - the dvd/cd/mp3 player should mute when a page comes from any source but there is no function for that. I rewired it to put out music on hold from a cd that repeats forever - the old we value your time - the next available operator will be with you in a moment" deal - then I piped that into the pbx's music on hold but kept it out of the paging signal so as to not drive everyone nuts in the office.When the pbx page button is pressed on any set the signal can be heard loud and clear throughout the office and lab space which is why we bought this. Also there is a recording on the CD for evacuation that is triggered by the alarm via a learning IR contact closure programmed from the remote. It changes tracks on the cd, then also reconnects the music on hold signal to the speakers at max volume if a fire pull station is activated or if there is a gas leak in the labit's really an office pa system and not meant for home but does well with some rewiring in the office. Oh yes, they included the schematic for the amp with it which made modifications easier. For our smallest office it worked out well, but more than 2000 sq ft the power would be insufficent so its best suited for small offices integrated with a Nortel PBX and a little rewiring on the inside to kill the cd/dvd from paging all the time."
I won't repeat the wealth of information the other kind reviewers have already given. I'll just focus on why I decided to cough up the extra $100 to get the SB-800 instead of the less powerful SB-600.Compared to the SB-600, the SB-800 has the following extra features:1) Much more powerful, as reflected in the GN.2) Slightly faster recycle time with the standard four AA batteries. It also comes with a battery holder that holds a fifth battery which cuts down recycle time by 1/3 to 1/2.3) The SB-800 has non-TTL auto and auto aperture modes. (More on this later.)4) In wireless remote mode, the SB-800 can act both as the master and slave, whereas the 600 can only be a slave.5) It comes with a useful diffusion dome, which won't even fit on the SB-600.6) The SB-800 package also includes two colored gel filters.7) The SB-800 can do repeating flash (in the same exposure), for a strobe effect.Basically, both the 600 and 800 support Nikon's latest flash technologies, i-TTL (supported by the D70 and D2H only) and CLS (creative lighting system), in addition to all the TTL (through the lens) flash modes Nikon introduced in the past. The 600 is really a prosumer-level flash that's either TTL or manual, whereas the 800 is pure pro-grade with a lot of modes and options. The manual, evidently written by a Japanese manual writer, attests to its sophistication; understanding the manual will really require a Ph.D. in yoga so you don't stress yourself out.The 800's auto modes are what won me over in the end. The auto modes can set the flash output automatically on Nikon bodies that do not support any TTL (through the lens) mode. On those bodies, with the 600 you'd have to resort to manual, which is simply a pain in the butt, not to mention prone to error. The two non-TTL auto modes on the 800 are auto aperture and auto. You'll need to study the manual very carefully to figure out the difference; I still haven't, but I'm already enjoying the auto aperture mode. The availability of auto modes also means the 800 can be used on a wide range of Nikon bodies than the simpler 600.If you are deciding between the 600 and the 800 like I was, ask yourself the following questions:1) Do you have an extra $100-$150 to spend? If yes, the 800.2) Do you plan to use the external flash a lot? If yes, the 800.3) Do you have Nikon bodies (usually older manual ones) that do not support TTL (you can find out in the camera's user's guide)? If yes, the 800.4) Do you plan to do a lot of wireless flash photography and take full advantage of Nikon's Creative Lighting System? If yes, the 800.5) If you want to get a diffusion dome that fits the flash, get the 800.In the end, I think the SB-800 is a better long-term investment than the SB-600, despite the higher price. It's much more powerful and flexible, and even though it's an overkill for me right now, I imagine when my flash photography improves (and I'm trying very hard right now), it'll prove a very worthy investment.Feel free to drop me an e-mail at hotmail with any questions. BTW, if anyone knows of a good web forum that discusses how to use Nikon's flash modes and the CLS, please let us know. Thanks.
I bought this directly from HP when it was on sale (1 free if you buy 2). At first I was hesitant about buying 60 feet of canvas for a hundred and twenty bucks but if you are into fine art printing with 12 megapixel and up cameras, this will make a 20x24 print that looks like an oil painting using heavy pigment ink on my HP designjet 3200psHP DesignJet Z3200ps - 44" large-format printer - color - ink-jet - Roll (44 in) - 2400 dpi x 1200 dpi up to 2 min/page (color) - USB, 10/100Base-TXI didn't know if I should waste 8" to do a color calibration so I did anyways and it turned out for the better. The yellow was under represented in the pigment inks and the color calibration on the canvas boosted the yellow output.Because the canvas is primed it only required 3.4 ml of ink to print with vivid colors (HP vivera inks #70). I have not had a chance to try it yet on my DJ 130NR printer which uses dye based inks instead of the pigment, however a side by side comparison will need to be done.Take note that this is a thick cloth with a white primer. It actually used less ink than a similar size photo paper and gave a much more vivid picture in 20 x 24". The next step is to buy a frame for it and tack it into the frame. You can make a frame yourself from 1x2 lumber and a air tack gun. Bevel the ends (the 20 and 24 sticks) to 45 degrees and square it all up. Use your same pneumatic tack gun to stretch the fabric in a lugnut pattern, pulling it tight in the process. You will want generous margins on all 4 sides to accomplish this. Finally you can put it under glass or just leave the fabric open as its lifespan is 200 years."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Kingston Technology CF/128 128MB Compactflash Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Update 10/2010 The TF-22 has quickly become my favorite closeup flash - mainly because I can achive an infinite number of angles by rotating each head 360 degrees around the lens and 120 degrees in or out towards the subject and to top that off I can adjust each flash head's light balance by 8 bars on the light balance graph to simulate side light (i.e. the left flash is 32 times brighter than the right flash) - this is adjustable when the TF-22 is connected to the controller, but not with the ring. I've added one more photo on 10/2010 that you can't see unless you check see all pictures - it shows the modeling light on. There has been some confusion about the modeling light since I wrote this review originally. You can turn it on manually and it will turn off by a timer which you can set, or it will come on automatically when you are autofocusing as a substitute for the red lights on the 50R flash that cast a grid for the camera to focus with. It is one very versitile flash, and you can add the ring flash if you need more power later by just purchasing the ring flash by itself - all the controller functions are inside the TF-22 kit here.Original review: Olympus manufactures two flash units, a GN36 ring flash and a GN22 twin flash system. Both use the FC-01 flash controller, however each can be angled uniquely. While the ring flash is directed out parallel to the lens, the twin flash can be adjusted over 45 degrees inward to the lens, and rotated horizontally or vertically. For hard to light scenes the twin flashes can be removed and attached to small tripods. The FC-01 controller, which must be close, can be extended using an FC-05 cableThe twin flash fits almost every lens made. On the 50mm prime lens, it does need the FR-1 adapter (as does the ring flash) - but this protects the lens focus which extends nearly 50 mm from the lens body, so it's not a bad accessory to have on such an expensive and well designed lens as the 50mm prime macro lensOlympus 50mm f/2.0 Telephoto Macro ED Lens for E1, E300 & E500 Digital SLR Cameras.On the 50-200 mm zoom and the 14-54 mm lenses, the ring flashOlympus SRF-11 TTL Ring Flash Set for the C7070, E1, E300 & E500 Digital Camerassimply mounts to the bayonet for the sunshade mount. The twin flash kit includes a support ring that screws into the filter threads on these lenses for mounting. The ring is quicker to remove, but the twin is much more flexible in lighting hard to flash macro scenes.One lens can not use the ring flash at all - the 11-22 mm wide angle which is a good macro lens as well. The reason is that is spreads out to a 72 mm filter thread, much larger than the normal 67 mm thread. The TF-22 CAN be used with the 11-22 mm lense because it has a double threading, with the second for the 72 mm filter thread on the 11-22 mm lens making it an exceptional wide angle macro lens.As a result the TF-22 works on everything the Ring flash does, and one more.The FC-01 flash controller has unique operating modes depending on which flash unit is plugged in. On the TF-22 it gives you 16 steps to balance the amount of light sent to the A" flash and the "B" flash. This can create interesting lighting effects. When used with the Ring Flash or Twin Flash, the FC-01 MUST be used to adjust your fine tuning illumination of the scene, as the camera can not keep up at the close distances. In effect, the +/- control on the camera is deactivated using a macro flash, but the FC-01 has a +/- 3.0 adjustment on the flash itself, so you are able to get the perfect exposure. You have the option of TTL metering or using full manual control if you have gone to manual exposure on the camera.In all cases, with all flashes, you have modeling lights that can be activated by a button on the FC-01. I find the best use for these is to predict where your image of the flash will appear in the final photo by looking for the modeling lights in the viewfinder prior to the exposure. The twin flash gives you the ability to angle the lights in such a way as to keep the glare out of the lens and keep spots out of your final picture. With the ring flash you end up moving the whole camera.Note - Due to the angles possible on the twin flash you MUST have clean filter glass or else every spec of dust will show up in your photo, expecially with the 11-22 mm lens due to its depth of field at high f stops.ORDERING:I can not stress this enough: You only need ONE FC-01 flash controller for macro flashes, so olympus setup their ring/twin flash systems into both KITS and add-ons. If you buy the ring flash KIT (SRF-01) you can add on the twin flash later (TF-22) and have both options. If you buy the twin flash kit to begin with (STF-22) you can buy the ring flash add on later (RF-01) and have the same kit! Unless your FC-01 breaks, or you feel the need to have two macro flashes ready at all times on two bodies, then don't buy two kits (beginning with S in the model number) or else you will double up on your flash controllers. The FC-01 can also be purchased separately.As for compatibility, the FC-01 is a copy of the FL-50 and uses the same high voltage generators, such as the SHV-01 and the FP-01. In fact, you can combine the AA NiMH cells in the flash, the FP-01, and the SHV-01 all 3 at the same time to get sub 1 second cycle times with full flash intensity. Compared to the 7-9 seconds on the FL-50, sub second recharge times are great for sequence shooting. UPDATE: 2010 I've moved this to the E3 body and the flash is controllable from the camera for spreads of lighting intensity over a range, something we could not do on the E300.In summary- Macro Flashes are good from 6 cm to 6 meters- Ring flash is brighter than the Twin Flash- Twin flash is more controllable than the ring flash for extreme closeups- any product beginning with (S) (SRF-01, STF-22, SHV-01, etc) is a complete kit- The macro flash kits are in keeping with the long distance FL-50(R) flashes and make use of the same high voltage rapid flash suppliesOlympus SHV-01 High Voltage Flash Power Pack (for FL-50, SRF11, STF22 & FC01)."
This battery is long-lasting which I bought it form Eforcity. This battery seems to charge very fast too! I think it is well-worth buying 2 of them, but the battery lasts so long that you can easily get by with only one!
Even without the current $20 mail-in rebate, the Lexar 1GB 80x CF card is a great bundle, as it includes a valuable piece of software called Image Rescue. For prosumer and pro photographers, it's critical to be on guard against memory errors and be able to recover lost" images before resorting to formmatting.The Lexar is a very fast CF card. PAD's review from October 4, 2004 was not exactly correct. The write acceleration (WA) technology from Lexar supposedly implements a multi-sector write mode in dSLRs that support this technology. While this sounds great on paper, in practice it's not important that your dSLR (e.g., Canon's excellent offerings) does not support it. The dSLR is already optimized for super-fast serial writes, and all dSLRs can take advantage of Lexar's high-speed architecture, just like they can with Sandisk's pro CF cards. Indeed, Lexar guarantees that the card will work in your camera, or your money back.Should you get a Lexar or a Sandisk? It's pretty much a toss-up, esp. after Sandisk seems to have fixed the QA problems that plagued its flash memory cards a couple years back. My recommendation: just get the one that's cheaper. For the same price, though, the Lexar has Image Rescue, which makes it a better bundle."
... For a 1000 watt 12VDC system.Fuses for 12VDC can not have much drop across the fuse because the battery (fully charged) is 12.8 VDC and the battery is considered drained" at 10.5 VDC. That's only 2.3 V of drop in your entire system including wires, connectors, fuses, and the battery. It's better if you have an alternator and engine running but they'll give you 124A or so while the battery can deliver 1000 amps. At 1000 watts constant power you will pull 115 Amps - that leaves you with 0.02 ohms for your entire wiring system to run 1000W with a charged battery and 2.3 V drop. If your battery is running low, consider it more like 0.01 ohms of max system loss. If your engine is on up at 14VDC you get some slack so long as your alternator &lt;-> battery link is good.You still need a fuse in the system though because the alternatives working with these power levels are arcwelding.These high current fuses are optimal for such systems. For 1000W consider a minimum of 150 amps or possibly a 200 amp fuse. The clear plastic covers protect the screwdown terminals from stray metal and let you get a visual on the fuse status should it blow (it won't be pretty if it does blow - stopping a 115A DC current is going to produce a nasty arc and will also leave smoke inside the cover - no problem telling if the fuse blew!A little secret - if you wonder why it is so hard to stop high power (200+ amps) DC and easy with AC it's that with 60Hz AC the voltage is exactly zero 60 times per second and usually stops on its own, so your arc lasts for a maximum of 1/60th second and with a sine wave source it naturally tapers down to zero where it stops. DC will go on forever if the gap isn't large enough."
In NW-HD3, Sony finally added native MP3 support to its tiny hard disk-based digital music player, so no conversion to its proprietary ATRAC3 format is necessary. This makes the player much more attractive to users already with a large collection of MP3 files. Styling-wise, this new player comes in five color choices: red, pink (looks purplish to me), blue, black, and silver. Backlighting color is also different depending on the exterior color. Plenty of eye candy, for sure. (FYI, mine is red.)Internally, other than the added support for MP3, the HD3 is exactly the same as the HD1. In fact, even the dimensions and weight (4.5 oz.) are the same. It's also the same 1.8 20GB hard drive inside. It has the same SUPERB sound quality as the HD1. (Seriously, before listening to ATRAC3 on the HD1, I hadn't known compressed music could sound so good.) Both models claim up to 30 hours of battery life when playing back ATRAC3Plus files. (On my HD1, I routinely got over 25 hours of playback on a single charge.) For MP3, Sony claims "up to 20 hours." As I write this, I've been playing a mixture of 128kbps and 192kbps MP3 files for about eight hours on my last recharge and the battery is at the half mark. Of course, ifyou turn on the equalizer, choose shuffle (random) play, or press the buttons a lot, the battery will run down faster. (Hard drive spinning and backlighting consume the most power.)BTW, the LiIon battery in the HD3 *can* be user-replaced in theory; see p.39 of the manual. The only question is where can you and I get a spare battery. I wouldn't buy a generic battery on ebay because 1) there are reports that these "fake" batteries don't work, and 2) if improperly charged, they can explode, just like with the exploding cell phones. Like the HD1, the HD3 has just a few buttons. The menu and mode buttons on the top seem easier to press than the HD1, which is a welcome improvement. The play/stop button is still a bit too small for my big thumbs. The four-way arrow buttons are responsive and I personally prefer a simple linear control scheme like this over other "weird" interfaces such as scroll wheel or touch-sensitive strip. I also like the hold button on this thing; it's very easy to slide. Backlighting on the HD3 works well and the monochrome LCD is small but sharp.Some nice touches of the HD3 include the ability to choose "line out" instead of "headphones" when you want to run the output through an amplifier. ("Headphones" output is pre-amped and will sound distorted and harsh if it goes into an external amplifier.) There're also a six-band equalizer and virtual surround sound settings.Overall, the HD3 feels very solid physically and the player itself is pretty easy to figure out. Most audiophiles will like the superb sound quality they'll get if they rip into the ATRAC3Plus format. I've used this player in the gym, and it never skips a beat.Now, the not-so-pleasant side of this little wonder...Even though HD3 is a HUGE improvement over its predecessor HD1 due to the native MP3 playback capability alone (well, a lower introductory price is also a big plus), its user interface and music transfer interface haven't been improved at all. The updated SonicStage software (now at version 2.3) is fine some of the time, but a nightmare other times. There are a number of nagging issues:1) You cannot simply copy your MP3 files to the HD3 and expect to play them later. The HD3 does appear on Windows desktop as an external drive, and you can copy any files (including MP3 files) to its hard drive. Basically this allows you to use the HD3 as an external disk drive. But, in order for the MP3 files to play back as audio, they must be transferred using the included SonicStage music management software. (Internally, SonicStage places all transferred music tracks, MP3 or ATRAC, in a proprietary database on the HD3. You cannot access these tracks directly from Windows Explorer.)2) While you can charge the HD3 using the USB cable via the small USB adapter (it doesn't have a docking cradle a la the HD1), which is a cool thing, you cannot transfer music without plugging in the AC adapter. This is just plain stupid and it means if you want to transfer music on other PCs, you must carry the AC adapter with you. The AC adapter is small and one-piece, but it's still a pain to have to remember carrying it with you.3) You still must "authorize" the HD3 with the Sony Connect music service. This is pretty straightforward -- when it works. The whole music rights control system Sony forces upon us is so freaking convoluted and stupid and irksome. To the dumbheads at Sony marketing: we users want a simpler way to manage and transfer music! Even Windows Media Player 10 is way better at these than SonicStage 2.3.4) You cannot rate music like you can in Windows Media Player. Creating playlists (called "groups" by Sony in the HD3 manual but known as "albums" in SonicStage -- go figure!) in SonicStage is a bit of a pain. You cannot create playlists on the HD3 itself. It only has a feature called Bookmark which basically combines ratings and a rudimentary playlist into one function. You can bookmark up to 100 songs.5) Shuffle (random) and repeat plays are ridiculously complicated and require lots of button presses; and you cannot activate them when a song is playing! Take a look at pp.25-28 of the manual and be prepared for an anxiety attack. Once again, Sony introduces some totally stupefying concept to make their American users' playback experience miserable: this time it's something calld "play unit" which involves where you start playback. Anyway, it just makes no sense whatsoever. In a nutshell, it's almost impossible to get consistent shuffle plays on the HD3. Sometimes it shuffles the entire collection of your music, other times it does just a folder or artist. Totally bewildering.6) Native WMA playback is still not supported. You can convert non-copy-protected WMA files into ATRAC using SonicStage, a time-consuming process. If you have WMA tracks bought from an online store (MSN Music, Walmart, Musicmatch, etc.), you cannot convert them.7) Sony just has to come up with a better name than "Network Walkman NW-HD3." And you call that POS a case???In short, like the earlier HD1, the HD3 is an amazing piece of hardware with terrific sound quality, amazing battery life and a solid feel (but not heavy in weight) not found on any other MP3 player. If only Sony would improve the player's interface as well as the scary SonicStage software (esp. in the copy protection department), this would simply be the best MP3 player, period."But," you ask, "is the NW-HD3 right for me?"The answer depends on what you want. If you want great sound quality *and* the best hardware form factor, the HD3 is your top choice. If you can, rip to ATRAC3Plus for top-notch sound quality and prolonged battery life. If you want a tiny yet solid MP3 jukebox and don't mind studying the electronic manual (in PDF), the HD3 is also a good choice, and you get long battery life as a bonus. If you prefer linear scrolling (like I do) to alternative methods, you'll like the HD3's simply four-way controls. If, however, your cup of tea is simplicity (esp. on the desktop software side) over sound quality, you'll be better off with an iPod; if you want something with lots of bells and whistles (FM, recording, calendar, etc.), you'll be happier with something from Creative Labs.Here are a few tips that I hope will help smooth your HD3 experience:1) You must use the version of SonicStage on the HD3's CD-ROM (v2.3, but somehow more "special" than the updater you can download on Sony's website). If you have any older version installed, be sure to uninstall it first. Reboot, then install the new version.2) If you run into any problems with transferring music -- and many users do sooner or later -- call the Sony Connect/SonicStage's toll-free support number. They are much, much better and more competent than the hardware support people, who are clueless and useless on anything other than which button you should press to play music. E-mail me if you want that phone number. (It's on Connect's website but a bit hard to find.)3) Don't bother with getting a remote control. The two that are Japan-only but can be special-ordered are just way over-priced for the simple functions they have. There's been consistent talk in user forums that Sony will probably introduce one of the remotes here, in which case it'll certainly be much cheaper than what you'll pay right now. But if you really *need* a remote, e-mail me and I can tell you which one you should get (and which one to avoid) and which legit source to get it from."
This UltraLast rechargeable LiIon battery is an OEM version of Casio's official NP-40 battery for many members of the Exilim family of digital cameras: EX-Z40, EX-Z50, EX-55, EX-Z57, and (I believe) EX-Z750, among others.The official Casio NP-40 costs over $45 here on Amazon (list $49.99), so this UltraLast clone is a great value. Usually I'm very cautious when it comes to generic rechargeable batteries, since the poor-quality ones can explode if over-charged, but I decided to take a bet on this one since it's sold by Amazon. Plus, it actually has more power (1300 mAh) than the Casio one (1230 mAh).I received my UL-CNP40 a couple days ago and so far it seems safe and reliable. Charging takes a little over 3 hours just like with the NP-40 that came with my EX-Z55, and over the weekend I shot a few hundred photos and saw no difference in performance between this and the NP-40.So I think this is a keeper, although, a paranoid that I am, I'll use the Casio NP-40 as my main battery and keep this chareged as a backup. Between these two batteries, I'm confident I can shoot over 500 pictures with LCD and flash on, and probably over 1,000 with LCD off and using the EX-Z55's optical viewfinder.BTW, if you get this or any other battery as a spare, you should also get the Casio rapid charger BC-30L, available here at Amazon for $44 or so. It's a wall plug-in type and you can charge one battery while using the other. (Otherwise you'll have to charge one battery in camera, take it out, and charge the other battery before you head out on your trip.)
A solid and affordable DVD player. Does not seem to have progress scan, but on most standard TVs that doesn't matter. Progress scan matters only when you have HDTV, at least that's my understanding. On my Sharp 20&quot; the Sony outputs clear video images. My unit was made in Malaysia, not Japan, though, so I hope the quality will prove itself over time.
These slim jewel cases by Maxell provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and any other type of media, blank or with data on it, of the same shape and thickness! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. I think these are well constructed. They hold together and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases provide excellent storage for media and they measure roughly half the width of the older, original jewel cases that seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too.These jewel cases can store discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or whatever. They are not ugly, either. In fact, they come in five different colors including red, blue and green. You can use these colors to categorize types of media so you don't have to hunt endlessly for the type of media you're looking for.In addition, because these cases are so slim you can carry a few of them in a carry case for a laptop computer. That's very good.My only gripe is that these jewel cases come in packs of thirty. That's not enough for people like me who have large collections. If you have lots of discs you may want to buy a fifty-pack or even a one hundred-pack from either Maxell or another seller on this website.Overall, I still recommend these CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. Use these in good health--they should last forever!"
Sandisk has started production of the 1GB SD card and they will be shipped to distributors by late Jan. 2004, according to PC World web edition. This comes almost a year after the initial product announcement, and will be welcome news for digital photographers who take lots of 5+ megapixel TIFF pictures. I'll order one when Amazon offers it and post a review later.
The iPod first appeared four years ago, and the features continue to grow, with each update.The iPod with video playback was introduced on October 13, 2005. However, one should not necessarily consider this player a video player, but a great iPod music player, with video capabilities as a fantastic bonus. Nevertheless, the iPod with video playback is the most capable and feature-rich iPod ever produced by Apple.I have owned the 60 gig iPod with video playback, for several days now, and I continue to be impressed. Its physical appearance, quality, craftsmanship, and the wide array of features are keeping me entertained!Video Playback - The iPod plays back H264 and MPEG4 encoded video. The iPod's new display is larger than ever at 2.5 inches, giving it a resolution of 320x240. What video content can you play on your iPod? This area is limited, at least currently. You can buy music videos on iTunes at $1.99 per song, which will play beautifully on the iPod. Furthermore, Apple has made available select television shows, for download on iTunes. They cost $1.99 per episode, for titles including ABC's hits Lost and Desperate Housewives. You can also watch the episodes you purchase on your computer. If you want to put some of your own video, onto your iPod, you will need to use an application such as QuickTime Pro to convert the video to the specific requirements to play on the iPod. You can also find video podcasts, which will play on the new iPod. Even if you do not plan to view video on the new iPod, its primary purpose is to be used as the world's best music player. You can still benefit from the beautiful new display, for it will help you find your favorite music faster, and you can view the album art that accompanies your music.Size of new iPod - Does the picture of the new iPod make it appear larger to you? Well, it did to me. The iPod looked wider, in the photos I saw. However, it is not. The height and width of the iPod are identical to the previous generation iPod with click wheel. The only change in dimensions is the depth. The new iPod is actually thinner than what came before it! Yes, even this 60 gig is thinner than the previous 20 gig photo model. What does all this mean? The iPod continues get smaller, making it even easier to carry.Capacity - This 60 gig iPod has room, for a lot of entertainment. With storage, for up to 15,000 songs, 25,000 photos, or 150 hours of video. The great thing I love about my 60 gig iPod is that my music, photos, and video only take up about 15 gigabytes. However, I use the additional space to backup data, from my computer. This is incredibly helpful, and could be a real saver, if something happened to your computer. See, the iPod functions as an external hard drive, so you can backup all sorts of data. Furthermore, with the video capabilities on the new iPod, you may find yourself needing the extra space that this 60 gig iPod provides.New Software Features - Apple has added features, to the new iPod besides video support. First, they have a clock feature, which quickly allows you to view the time, in up to four different time zones simultaneously. Furthermore, there is a stop watch, and a screen lock, which you can enable to keep people from snooping on your calendar and/or contacts.Battery - The battery life is one of the most important specifications that you, as an iPod user, are going to care about. This 60 gigabyte iPod sports a battery that will last up to 20 hours, when playing only music. Also note that repeatedly changing songs manually, and turning on the backlight will use up your battery considerably faster. Furthermore, the iPod's battery lasts a maximum of three hours, when playing back video. This version of the iPod no longer includes an adapter to charge the iPod, at an electrical outlet. You will have to buy that adapter separately, or always charge the iPod via USB 2.0. The charging works fine, from your computer's USB 2.0, but if you're traveling you might want the ability to charge, with the adapter. Also note that the iPod no longer supports syncing via firewire cable. You will have to use USB 2.0.Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. The iPod syncs your contacts, video, and music via the iTunes software.Podcasting - The iPod continues to support podcasting. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, for this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box. There are also video podcasts, so with the new iPod, you will be able to watch video podcasts, on the iPod's display.Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. The new iPod is available in a black or white finish. The black color is quickly becoming the most popular, but the white iPod is still the signature color. Do note that the black may show fingerprints and scratches more than the white iPod, much as a black car shows these blemishes more than a lighter colored car. Apple is including a small sleeve-type case, with this iPod, to help you keep it in good condition.Audiobooks - I'm always using my iPod, to listen to audiobooks. You can store literally hundreds of audiobooks on here that you buy from iTunes, or Audible. The iPod even has a feature that can slow down or speed up the reading of the audiobook, so that you hear it at just the right pace.Output - The iPod connects to your PC or Mac via the dock connector at the bottom of the unit. You will connect the included cable, to the computer via a USB 2.0 port. Furthermore, accessories are being made that will also connect to the bottom dock port, and you may purchase Apple's Universal iPod dock, for easy syncing to your computer. The dock (available separately) also includes s-video output, so you can show off slideshows and video, on a television. There are also iPod A/V cables available that allow composite video and audio output, for connecting your iPod to your television. This might interest you, not only to display slideshows on a television, but also to display TV shows or music videos on a television, which you purchased from iTunes.Value - This 60 gigabyte iPod is priced at $399, which is a great value. It provides a huge amount of storage space, and more features than ever.Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Enjoy your iPod experience.
This Sandisk 256MB Memory Stick flash memory card is reliable and it's a perfect fit for the latest Sony digital cameras and Clie handhelds. Sandisk designs their own memory controller circuits and they are good at making the Memory Stick compatible with all new Sony products. As long as you don't drop this or soak it in water (why would you do that?), you should expect many years of solid service out of this.BTW, you shouldn't be paying more than $40 for this, and as of today (1/3/05) Amazon has the best price. Shop around if Amazon price goes above $40 (before rebate).The Sandisk 512MB Memory Stick Pro flash card is also good, although some Sony products may not be able to use all 512MB. Check your Sony manual before you buy. Good thing Amazon does offer a 30-day money back guarantee.
This item is exactly as illustrated and advertised. It works great. The reception on my HD TV improves dramatically.
I guess you sum up teleconverters as a way to get a little more out of your lens(es), but at a price. Olympus has not kept up on their compatibility list" for this - it turns out it works on alot of lenses that are not on the "compatibility list" - even other (sigma) brands. So the five stars are for its compatibility in the system.Before you buy it - look at all your options. I did finally buy it but first I looked at a "better" lens. They were all slower than my existing 50-200mm + 1 stop. It ends up being a 283 mm lens with the OLY teleconverter, so it was the best solution overall. It's not exactly 1.4 but pretty closeI did not like loosing the 1 stop, and I did notice the darker image in the viewfinder as the 1 stop loss is not removed while focusing like any dialed in stops are, but that's the real price you pay - you are just more aware of it. I use the converter on about 10% of my shooting with the 50-200 lens when I am outside and have a tripod or inside with a GN 50 flash. Remember it magnifies your movement too so a good tripod helps with the extra weight.A last couple of notes - keep in mind your photo size is 4 x 5.33" and not 4x6 so be sure to zoom out just a bit and leave a boarder for post processing into 4x6 standard prints. Having the extra zoom tends to make you want to fill the frame but then you must cut something later. Your camera's weight and balance will change too. Pick a decent tripod that can handle the combined weight of your lens, body, teleconverter, along with flash and extra power systems. A flimsy tripod will show in your 1:1 pixel reviews of your shots. Finally, the 1.2 x magnifier for the eyepiece seems to work really well with this in your optics line to aid in focusing with the extra 1 stop you can not take out of your lens.This is a quality product from Olympus and extends your flexibility on many lenses, but at a price. If you own a "favorite" lens, this is probably a great add-on but ask around about compatibility first as new lenses are showing up all the time."
These slim jewel cases by Memorex provide sturdy protection for CDs and DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. Could that be because I'm a 90 pound weakling? SMILE Well, I doubt it--I think these are well constructed. They hold together for years at a time and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases provide excellent storage for media and they measure roughly half the width of the older, original jewel cases that seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too.Moreover, these jewel cases are affordable--and that's great in these times. Each case costs roughly 40 cents which is great considering how long these will last for you. Years' worth of storage space! These jewel cases can be storing discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or whatever. They are not ugly, either.Overall, I highly recommend this CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. Use these in good health!SMILE"

You can use these colors to categorize types of media so you don't have to hunt endlessly for the type of media you're looking for.Overall, I highly recommend these CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. I feel badly for those reviewers who had some damaged cases in their shipment; but my shipment came completely intact. Use these in good health!"
Wow these cables are great, for the price and come gold plated. They seem very durable also, with plenty of thickness and shielding.
The price tag says it all: this is one power machine, even when you don't consider the Blu-ray drive. The styling is nothing short of gorgeous -- it'll turn heads everywhere you go. (It's 500 times cooler than anything Apple has produced.) The machine itself is a speed demon, and the 17 screen is breath-taking for a laptop. I don't know why one other person was complaining about "no 1080p"; on a PC, you don't need 1080p because the screen always renders everything in progressive scan mode and the "lack" of resolution is addressed via a superb downscaling algorithm in the computer itself, so you get top-notch video image quality.$3300 is a lot of dough to cough up for a computer, but if you want one that makes a powerful statement about your status or just want the best geekware, this is for you."
I just got this so I'll give some first impressions. I'll come back in a month or two to fill in more details.In short, this is the camcorder you've been waiting for: vivid, almost broadcast-quality home videos. OK, that's assuming you know how to shoot steady and well-framed videos. The camcorder with its three CCD chips gives you the technical superiority over your next-door neighbors, but ultimately if you shoot trash, you get trash. But for those of us who know how to shoot like a pro (e.g., no in-camera zooming, steady and slow pans, no in-camera special effects), the results are simply amazing. If you, for example, are a serious amateur home-movie maker or an aspiring filmmaker, you'll definitely love this camcorder.Because this is an affordable camcorder, Panasonic seems to have cut a few (minor) corners. Indoor/night shots are no better than the average consumer 1-chip camcorder. Of course if you have plenty of lighting, you'll once again reap the benefits of having 3 CCDs to capture light. But if you just use existing indoor lighting you won't find this working wonders. Also its optical zoom is lower than many newer camcorders. As always, digital zoom is next to useless.The camcorder is pretty easy to set up and use; no Ph.D. in VCR programming required. For this review I just wanted to focus on its main selling point, the 3-chip video capture system. Other amenities include manual focus, 2MP digital still camera, remote controls, etc. Battery life seems average, after you cycle the battery properly a couple times.If you want to take beautiful (outdoor) videos and don't have a fat wallet, you should definitely consider getting this camcorder.NOTE: From what I read, the cheaper PV-GS120 model foregoes the manual focus ring, the wired remote and the flash. I assume that model has the same video quality as the GS200.
Cables are well made from what appear to be great quality components. Fast shipping, great cables, who could ask for more!
First off, everyone should know that a DVD/VCR combo machine such as this Panasonic will not allow you to tape DVDs you rent at Blockbuster! Most DVDs have Macrovision anti-copying technology which makes it impossible to copy to a VHS tape without a hacked VCR machine. You can, however, tape your own home-movie DVDs made on a PC.As with their stand-alone DVD and VCR products, the Panasonic is an excellent machine that's easy to use, buit to last, and offers great video quality on all kinds of TV sets. The remote control unfortunately is a bit more complicated than necessary, but that doesn't distract from the good overall design of the machine itself. The biggest advantage of an integrated DVD/VCR is that it saves space and cables. The biggest downside is if one thing breaks, you have to fix the whole unit. Luckily, Panasonic is known of its excellent quality control, and my first VCR purchased 15+ years ago, a Panasonic, still works to this very day! My family owns a few Panasonic DVD players -- I have a big family -- and they all work flawlessly, including my first DVD player which I bought back in 1999, at the dawn of DVD age.Finally, I personally prefer to silver model, because it looks high-tech and looks stunning under my black Xbox. :)
this item is good for my printer which can print over 100 pages.
If you are looking for something for the living room (i.e., as your main TV set), 20 just won't cut it. It's just too small for today's modern human eyes. For a typical living room, the minimum TV should be a 37" Panasonic plasma set. 42" is another good choice, although for most people 50" would be an overkill.This Sharp 20" NTSC TV is perfect for the bedroom. It takes up very little space on the nightstand, and it sports sharp and high-contrast image quality, making watching TV pleasant rather than eye-straining. This model is not widescreen, but that's ok for me because at 20", widescreen would have made images too small for me. This model is also not HDTV, but rather EDTV (extended definition), which it means it fully supports progressive-scan DVD playback. Hook this up to a progressive scan DVD player -- I have the super-compact CyberHome model I got at Radio Shack for $45 -- and you'll get some great-looking DVD movies in your bedroom.As a secondary TV for your bedroom or kitchen or study, this Sharp delivers great quality and great value."
This is a low-cost 24-pin quiet printer designed for the home or small business that needs quality printing. It uses a push tractor for easy paper loading. There is an option to use single sheets from a sheet feeder (KX-PT12). The operator panel and software disk let you control the printer's features. It has 3 draft fonts (Micron, Elite, Pica) and 4 letter-quality fonts (Courier, Prestige, Bold PS, Script). The fonts can be in 10 different character sizes. The factory setting is to emulate the Epson LQ-850. The 11.7 carriage allows either portrait or landscape orientation for its 8" print line. All controls are accessible from the front or top of this unit. The power line cord and printer cable are not in the way of the paper path.This dot-matrix printer can print the original and up to 3 non-carbon copies. Its 14K buffer can be expanded with the 32K expansion chip (KX-P44). It uses the KX-145 black ribbon cartridge. The KX-P2023 can emulate the Epson LQ-850 or the IBM Proprinter X24E (for software programs that do not have support for this printer). There is a software program to provide drivers for Panasonic dot-matrix printers in Windows 95, 98, and Me. WIN31DMP.exe supports: KX-P1081,KX-P1123, KX-P1124, KX-P1124i, KX-P1150, KX-P1180,KX-P1624, KX-P1695, KX-P2023, KX-P2123, KX-P2124, KX-P2130/2135, KX-P2180, KX-P2624, KX-P3123, KX-P3124, KX-P3624.You can see how inkjet printers have simplified printing for users since the early 1990s. It is now as easy as dialing (or "buttoning") a telephone."
The sock is nice, keeps my thumbs warm. It's also great for bundling up those earbuds quickly and keeps me from scratching the case that keeps me from scratching my ipod.
Yeap, this works really well with the Sony PSP. Out of the box, Windows reports this has 490MB available. This is due to the different ways storage manufacturers and Windows calculate capacity. In Windows, 1MB=1024KB, 1KB=1024B, whereas for storage manufacturers, 1MB=1,000,000B, so 512MB" is really less than that as calculated by Windows.Most PSP games seem to use about 600KB - 800KB for user data storage. Most MP3 songs encoded at 128kbps bitrate come out to 1MB per minute. So if you have two games and use the rest of this Memory Stick only for MP3, you can hold about 122 songs. Not something to write home about, but you can always download your favorite tunes to the Memory Stick and play them when you take a respite from gaming.It's difficult to say how much video you can hold, because that depends entirely on how you encode (bitrate, audio quality, etc.). As a rough rule of thumb, this card can hold about one hour of acceptable-quality video.You can access this Memory Stick Duo card by either hooking up your PSP to your PC directly (using a $5 mini-B USB 2.0 cable), or using a USB reader. I use the Sony high-speed reader (model # MSAC-US30), which is super-reliable and super-fast. If you have a third-party reader or laptop that can only take the full-size Memory Stick -- "Memory Stick Duo" cards are less than 50% of the full-sized Memory Sticks -- this package comes with an adapter that turns the Memory Stick Duo into a full-sized Memory Stick.Sandisk has a 1GB Memory Stick Duo card for about $125, which is also a good value. But in the past I had inconsistent reliablity experience with Sandisk products, so I much prefer using a Sony Memory Stick Duo. 512MB is okay for now, but I think I'll need at least 1GB for the full PSP experience: one movie, a couple short videos, 30 or so of my favorite songs, and game data for a few games. I imagine it'll be another year before 2GB Memory Stick Duos come down to the $100 level."
The iBook G4 line has been incredibly successful, for Apple. Why? It combines a beautiful and sleek form factor, while at the same time being a machine capable of getting your tasks completed.Improvements - What were the improvements in the July 2005 update to iBook?Faster Processor - The G4 chip was increased, from 1.2 GHZ to 1.33 GHZ. Big improvement? No, but it is good to always improve performance, and an extra 133 MHZ is appreciated.More memory - The memory in the iBook has been doubled, with a now standard 512 MB DDR SDRAM, which speeds up your entire experience on the iBook, particularly, when multi-tasking. The iBook also has an open user-accessible slot, where you can add 256 MB, 512 MB, or an entire gigabyte of DDR SDRAM. However, the now standard 512 MB, allows the majority of users to fully appreciate the iBook out of the box.Store More Stuff - The hard drive has been increased to 40 GB, from the 30 GB that was previously standard. This is important, for people are constantly putting more music, photos, and applications on their systems. This hard drive will hold thousands of songs and photos, but you won't fit much video on here.Even More Wireless - Airport Extreme, for wireless networking, continues to be standard, but Apple has also made bluetooth technology standard, with this iBook. Bluetooth allows you to use wireless bluetooth mice, keyboards, mobile phones, etc. It is a great technology and helps to clean-up your desktop by doing away with some of the cords.Core Image Compatible - The new IBook G4's video card is an ATI Mobility Radeon 9550, which is core-image compatible. This allows you to take advantage of Mac OS X Tiger's core-image technology, including the well-known droplet" effect, when you open a widget.The great iBook features that continue to shine: A buyer of the iBook will continue to enjoy Mac OS X Tiger, which is the best consumer operating system in the world. It works seamlessly with the hardware to provide a simple, fast, elegant, and reliable experience. One of the favorite descriptions of Mac fans, to describe Macs, is simply, "it just works."The iBook continues to include iLife '05, with great applications such as iPhoto, iMovie HD, iDVD, iTunes, and Garageband. These are all included, with every iBook G4. You will be challenged to find any PC notebook that includes applications that come anywhere close to the iLife suite. Manage thousands of your digital images in iPhoto, create home movies in iMovie, and create professional music in Garageband.Appleworks is included for simply word processing, spreadsheets, etc., but you might want to pick up Microsoft Office for Mac. A student/teacher edition is available, for just over $100.ComboDrive - The Apple Combo Drive allows you to burn music and data CDs, plus you can watch DVDs!Form Factor - The iBook's strong, white casing is rugged. It is, unfortunately, prone to scratching, so be careful. However, the iBook is strong, and there are many stories of it taking a beating, but kept on performing.Drawbacks? The 12-inch iBook G4 does not have any option, for a Superdrive, which would allow you to burn DVDs. If you want a superdrive, you will have to pick-up the 14-inch iBook, or choose the 12-inch Powerbook. The other drawback is the video output options. The iBook only supports mirroring to an external display, and you cannot close the iBook, while connected to an external display, or it goes to sleep. Furthermore, the iBook splits the video memory between an external display and its on built-in LCD, no matter what you do. The external display is also limited to 1024x768, since it mirrors the iBook's own display. What does this mean? If you want a notebook that works beautifully with a big external display, when you're back at your desk, then you probably do not want an iBook. However, if you're going to use the iBook as its intended, as a notebook computer, it is a fantastic choice.Overall, the July 2005 update to the iBook G4 has made Apple's consumer notebook even more competitive in the market. It is faster, has more memory, a bigger hard drive, and bluetooth technology built-in. Furthermore, you'll continue to enjoy Mac OS X Tiger, iLife '05, and the other great Macintosh applications. The new iBook G4 is a brilliant machine, and it is sure to find its way onto many desks in the coming months."
These slim jewel cases by Fuji provide sturdy protection for CDs; but they can also store any type of media that is the same size, such as DVDs as well as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs, and more! I have been fortunate in that the cases I bought never cracked when I tried to open them. Could that be because I'm a 90 pound weakling? SMILE I doubt it--I think these are well constructed. They hold together for years at a time and that's great.Moreover, these slender jewel cases measure roughly less than half the width of the older, original jewel cases that now seem far too wide and fat" today. You can stick a "post-it" note to the front of the jewel case to indicate what's on the disc inside, too.These jewel cases can be storing discs on bookshelves, cabinet shelves or wherever. They are not ugly, either. In fact, they come in several different colors including red, yellow and blue. You can use these colors to categorize types of media so you don't have to hunt endlessly for the type of media you're looking for.As I write this the package of 25 jewel cases costs $5.99. That works out to a cost of roughly 24 cents per jewel case; and that is a bit more expensive than other packages of jewel cases for sale out there. This package of twenty-five jewel cases is really suited best for people with smaller media collections. People who have larger collections of media would do better to find jewel case packages with more jewel cases at a lower cost per case.Overall, I highly recommend these CD/DVD jewel cases for anyone who wants compact yet sturdy storage for their media. I feel badly for reviewers who had some damaged cases in their shipment; but my shipment came completely intact. Use these in good health!"
The product is with high quality, it is as great as the origial Epson ink. Price is great and it works as I expected. Good one!
When you are buying a Picasso, you can't expect to pay discount. The Powerbook G4 is a premium computer, and you pay a premium price. What you get puts competing PC-based products to shame, except, alas, on price.The biggest advantage of the PBG4 -- besides, of course, the operating system -- is design efficiency and elegance. Despite having a 15.2-inch screen and a fast processor (one optimized for intensive video applications and presentations), the PBG4 weighs just 5.6 pounds and is stunningly slim at 1-inch thick. Check your average ad for similarly equipped laptops and they simply can not compare.Take Sony's VAIO GRX for example. It boasts a &quot;gigantic 16.1-inch screen.&quot; Okay, great. I'd love a 16-inch screen too. But then, in the fine print, is this laughable phrase: &quot;Just 8.4 lbs. and 1.8&quot; thin.&quot;Let's see, sounds like a great tradeoff, doesn't it? You get about 12 percent more screen real estate, 55.5 percent more weight and 80 percent more bulk (and faster battery drain to boot).The Sony is about 20 percent cheaper, mind you, but I already told you about that part, right?Let's compare Apples to apples, then, shall we? A new VAIO model with a 15-inch display and Combo drive sells for about a grand less than Apple's deluxe Powerbook, and a few hundred below the bottom-of-the line. You would think with a smaller display, maybe they could take out some of that bulk? Naw. This one is &quot;Just 8.6 lbs. and 1.8&quot; thin.&quot;I don't know about you, but if the Sonys bulk up any more, their owners will be able to throw out their old &quot;Body By Jake&quot; video tapes.Now, there are a number of competitors using Intel Centrino chips now that are finally becoming competitive with the Powerbooks -- you can now get wider, higher resolution screens (a great 15.4-inch model on the Compaq x1000 series) that are less ugly and heavy than before. Battery life is comparable to the Powerbooks, for once. You can now find DVD burners, though not slot-loading models. But the PC 'books all come down to being utilitarian, plastic hunks of hardware, mostly thrown together with only an eye on maximum features for minimum price. Apple's are the product of a harmonious mix of design and integration that lead to a pleasing whole. It's the only company I know of that creates 5.6 pound pieces of aluminum art that will literally have you cracking a 1,000 watt smile when you open it up for the first time...And isn't that worth a few hundred bucks? A thousand? How much did you pay for the painting above your sofa?Taking this computer with you also gets you noticed. Jealousy abounds. You are instantly associated with the &quot;cool&quot; people. Add an iPod and you would fit right in to any hip hangout and become a magnet for like-minded folks who appreciate that there is more to life than just megahertz. Folks who understand feng shui and design and a better way of life will be attracted to you. Trolls will be repelled. Another bonus.By the way, you might also consider buying Apple's 3-year protection plan. Sure, it's expensive, but if you bought that Picasso, would you take it with you on an airplane (not to mention through overzealous security guards) without insurance?
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The 512MB Compactflash 12X Hhscanada Only, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this 512MB card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
The Optio takes true 4MP pictures, which are good for enlarged prints. The image quality is good, with decent colors and slightly soft edges. (I personally don't like sharp edges anyway.) The form factor makes it easy to hold, and the 3X optical zoom is fast and accurate. You can use either the LCD viewfinder or the optical viewfinder, the latter saving you considerable battery life. A solid product that I think you'll like. Do look around for the best price.
This is my second Canon camcorder. I loved my first, an ES970 that uses the regular 8mm format. After giving it to my uncle, I was shopping around for a new one when I saw this on Amazon. The price is right, and my very positive experience with the ES970 made it easy to order two of these, one for my parents.Both my parents and I love this camcorder. It's very easy to use -- no manual needed for the common functions. Even my mom can use it after I gave her a 1-minute lesson. The buttons are easy to reach and feel solid. The 22x optical zoom is the best in the industry, perhaps of any consumer camcorders sold in the States. I haven't tried the digital zoom yet, since I believe digital zoom, in general, is useless.The included LiIon battery is good, but I recommend buying an extended battery if you plan to go on a trip. My ES970's older-style NiMH battery lasted about 2 years before showing degraded capacity. The Canon LiIon batteries will probably last longer.This is a great camcorder, perfect for any family. Don't buy into the digital camcorder hype if you aren't going to edit your videos on a PC anyway. This Canon's price makes it deserve 10 stars.
Ok - looking at the FR-1 it looks like a barrel. For the most part, it is. It has the bayonet grooves that the lenses (the 14-54, and the 50-200 mm do) which allow the ring flash (RF-1) to just snap right on. It is ONLY needed if you want to use the macro lens, the 50 mm prime focusAttaching the FR-1 couldn't be easier - you press in 2 tabs which allow it to snap over the lens front. Releasing them holds it firmly in place.The FR-1 also protects the barrel of the 50 mm lens as you focus on very close objects. The barell can not exit the FR-1 body so you are never in danger of damaging your lens on closeups.Finally, the FR-1 has a set of threads (67 mm) to mount the TF-22 series of flashes. The RF uses the bayonet mount, while the TF-22 uses the filter thread mount. Note that the SR-1 has 2 thread cuttings, a 67 and a 72 mm thread. This allows you use the twin flash with the 11-22 mm lens for macro work. The FR-1 is needed for the 50mm prime lens with the TF-22 but not with the 11-22 mm lens because the SR-1 screws right onto that lens.A NOTE OF CAUTION - never force the RF-1 on or off the FR-1 - it is screwed together with tiny screws which will shear off if you twist the wrong direction. Not a problem for the TF-22. See the photos I uploaded for more details of how it goes together.All part of the olympus flash system parts - and a very important part if you have the 50mm prime focus macro lens.
This is a highly portable, highly affordable personal DVD player with a nice screen. 5.8 is not all that big, but perfect for occasional trips. It's wide-screen so it doesn't strain your eyes too bad. Battery life is a bit too short for a 2-hour movie, esp. if you set the volume to high..."
I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small. After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer: The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.2.1 mega-pixels (2.02 effective, according to manual) is nothing to write home about -- and the Canon continues to take under-saturated pictures -- but the picture quality is top-rate, besting many 3-mp cameras I have tested. The quality shows when you print the images, even at 5&quot;x7&quot;. I use an Epson 875DC and the images are many times better than those taken with my other digicams, even under the same shooting conditions.This camera is also easy to use; you can start shooting away after you unpack and charge the included LiIon battery. The LCD viewfinder is small but very clear. One good thing: your nose won't touch the LCD when you use the optical viewfinder (unless you have a very small face). Battery life is decent: I get about 50 shots with all flash and LCD on. Obviously you get more if you turn off LCD, and even more if you don't need flash all the time.This camera turns heads. Every time I take it out I can hear people around me talking about it. Some will ask me if they can hold it. I'm always proud to tell them that it takes great pictures, too. I love this little camera.So, what are you waiting for?

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk 64MB MultiMedia Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

The SV-S200 is a great DVD player for an incredible price. Makes a great first or second DVD player in your house. The black styling is, well, stylish, and the player is thinner than many more expensive models. Plays DVDs and DVD-Rs and also many Asian video formats... yes, great for watching those cheap kung-fu movie VCDs from Chinatown. :) Get this. It's so affordable, you have nothing to lose.
I bought it for my Kodak DX6490. Battery is impressive. Seems like it holds a charge better than the original. Recommended highly!
Maxell makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust. The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves!The color white is neutral and doesn't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the CD or DVD. You can also fold down the back flap of the envelope and tape it together so that the disc cannot fall out. This ensures that the CDs and DVDs don't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another.They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room.My only qualm is that these are made only from paper so the disc is not quite as well protected as it would have been in a plastic slim jewel disc.Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price. I highly recommend these Maxell CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical and cost-efficient alternative to jewel cases.
In October 2005, Apple updated its Powerbook G4 15 & 17 inch models, for the first time, since late January 2005. Unfortunately, a faster processor was not included in the update. However, it was still a worthy update!From when you first take this Powerbook out of the box, you are immediately impressed by its size, texture, sleekness, and overall clean design. The packaging is beautiful too, with the Powerbook comfortably nestled in, with all the accessories, and a packaging cover, which reads Designed by Apple in California." If you've anxiously awaited the arrival of your Powerbook, you will not be disappointed, when you start to open it up! When you turn it on, you're quickly greeted my OS X, and the Powerbook experience continues...Processor - The 15-inch Powerbook continues to be ran by a PowerPC G4 processor running at 1.67 GHZ. This processor is more than acceptable, for the vast majority of customers. It does a great job at daily computer tasks, and it is even very capable, for pretty intense photo work, and light video work. It is only unfortunate that we could not have seen a small boost to the processors, however, it was evidently not something feasible in this update, so Apple made up for it, with updates to other areas!Screen Resolution - The biggest improvement to the 15-inch Powerbook is an increase in screen resolution. Simply, a higher resolution allows you to fit more data, onto your display, making you more productive. The display now sports a 1440x960 resolution display allowing you to fit more windows or more of your photograph, on the screen. A valuable asset.Double Layer Superdrive - The Powerbook G4 now has superdrives (DVD burning capable) across the line. However, the 15 & 17 inch Powerbooks now sport double-layer super drives, which allows you to fit up to 8.5GB of data, on a single double layer disk. The drive's speed is still marketed as 8x.Memory - The Powerbook continues to come standard, with 512 MB of memory, but new system architecture now makes use of DDR2 memory. The 15 & 17 inch Powerbooks can be user upgraded, to have a maximum of 2 GB of memory. If you're going to be using your Powerbook, for more than basic consumer tasks, you will want to add more memory.Graphics - The 15-inch Powerbook now features 128MB of video memory standard, and the ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 card allows you to connect your 15-inch Powerbook to beautiful, big, displays such as the Apple 30-inch cinema display.Ports - The 15 inch Powerbooks have a great array of ports. Some of the very best in the industry. S-Video output, DVI output (plus a VGA adapter), Firewire 800, Firewire 400, Gigabit Ethernet, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio in, audio out, and a PC card slot. Whatever it is, you'll probably find a way to connect it to your Powerbook G4.Mac OS X - If you're considering Macintosh for the first time, you're going to love the Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger. It is incredibly user friendly, and you'll quickly find the interface and design is saving you time. Furthermore, Mac OS X is much more secure than Windows, so you can put your mind at rest.iLife - Although many power and professional users of a Powerbook are going to be using his or her Mac, for a lot of professional work, with professional applications, Apple still includes iLife with every Mac. iLife is a great way to manage your personal digital life. Store and manage your digital images in iPhoto, jam to music in iTunes, create music in Garageband, and create simple movies in iMovie.Furthermore, there are convenient applications built right into the operating system such as Dashboard, iCal (a great calendar that syncs up with your external devices including iPod), Dictionary, Expose, Stickies, DVD Player, and more.Appearance - The Aluminium enclosed Powerbook G4 may very well be the most beautiful notebook computer line ever made. It is an easy case to argue, for the sleek lines, and beautiful finish catches the eye of all who see it. Furthermore, it comes in light at 5.6 pounds.Battery Life - In ideal conditions, the 15-inch Powerbook G4 now sports longer battery life, with up to 5.5 hours.Wireless - Your 15-inch Powerbook will come standard, with an Airport Extreme card, for wireless networking. Furthermore, a bluetooth module is included, allowing you to use wireless devices, such as keyboards and mice, plus sync devices such as a mobile phone.Value - The increased value of this updated Powerbook G4 is one of the things that make it very appealing. Apple previously offered two 15-inch models: one, for approximately two-thousand dollars, and one for approximately three-hundred more. The higher end had more features. Those features have now been made standard on the 15-inch model (improved in some areas), but yet the price now starts at where the low-end used to be. That makes this Powerbook a great value.Overall, Apple has put great new features, in this update to the 15-inch Powerbook G4. You'll find yourself more productive with its high-resolution display, double layer superdrive, and fantastic video output options, with its capable video card. The Powerbook G4 15-inch is a fully-capable and feature-rich professional notebook computer. If you choose it as your notebook computer, you will no doubt benefit from its performance, reliability, and simplicity of design."
IOMEGA ZIP 100 DiskThe IOMEGA ZIP 100 disk is a high-capacity removable storage disk that is about the size of a standard 3.5 floppy disk. It can be read and written by an internal IDE drive (only one per system) or an external drive connected to a USB port or a parallel port (slowest in access). The IomegaWare Software provides utility functions designed for the ZIP disk, such as formatting or copying a disk. You should never use the Operating System disk copy function. Use the EJECT utility to remove a disk from a drive; this is required in Windows NT or Windows 2000. Remove the disk before turning a computer off You should never insert a ZIP disk in the drive when the computer is on as this can cause damage. Normally, shutting down the computer causes the disk to eject. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole.The IomegaWare software tests for the presence of the ZIP drive. It should be used in Windows 2000 to format a ZIP disk in the FAT format. Removable disks can contain a lot of data when it can be partitioned into 100 MB segments. The data on a ZIP drive can be read and written by different versions of an Operating System (using the FAT format). Rewriting reuses space, it does not increase the used space. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat (sunshine). The 100 MB ZIP disks can be read and written by a 250 MB disk drive.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SimpleTech STI-SD/64 64MB SecureDigital Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
You can't have everything. At least, not at 1,199 bucks.The bottom-of-the-line iBook is exactly what it should be: Extremely portable and extremely friendly. Extremely fast? Not.This is a compromise machine -- the screen is small and the processor is the slowest available on a Mac. At 12.1 inches, the screen is among the smallest you will find on a laptop nowadays, but it is super-sharp. And the fairly pokey processor is still more than adequate for word processing and iTunes and some basic graphics applications, and for surfing the web. Also, 128 MB of RAM is downright puny in today's computing world. You'll definitely want to upgrade to at least 256 MB.Now, for the good part. By making those compromises, the iBook is not only cheap, it is light -- under 5 pounds. Check out a similarly equipped laptop from your weekly Bestbuy ad, and you will see behemoths weighing in at 6, 7, 8 or even 9 pounds! And you will rarely find one this thin, and never one this cool.Battery power on the iBook also far outshines its PC competition, helped in part by that small screen and slow processor.This is basically the perfect machine for someone on the go -- including reporters like me -- or for a K-12 student.If these compromises are simply too much for you, Apple has an alternative for you -- the no-compromises, 5.4 pound, 1-inch thick, super-fast Titanium Powerbook G4. It's your choice.You get what you pay for.
These double-sided CD/DVD storage sleeves by Fellowes are wonderful! They can hold a LOT of CDs and/or DVDs in a very small amount of space and they are an immeasurable help when you want to keep them organized or in just one small space instead of having them lying around all over the house (as I had at one point)! The see-through sleeve is made of vinyl and it just plain feels as if it will last a long time.The sleeve does indeed have a little extra space for a title; and I like that. One reviewer notes that this extra space can become a minor problem--if the Ideastream or any other similarly sized CD/DVD sleeve holder box is full, you just may have to push the title space back to make the CD/DVD sleeves fit inside the box. I got around this by using a slightly larger box that I found in a local store.There's very little I can say that's negative about these sleeves. They should have cut the finger-hole opening into a deeper U" shape instead of the smaller keyhole shape but that's about it.I recommend this product for anyone who wants to organize CDs and DVDs."
I really like this case. All the openings are cut perfectly, precisely outlining the screen, wheel, and connectors. It perfectly fits my ipod video. It's soft and comfortable to hold. I am happy with it.
USB is a complicated protocol so lets get to simplification.USB Power is 5V +/- 0.5 V and 500 mA current. About 2.5 watts of power are available. The reason alot of external usb hubs come with a wall wart is if you have 4 devices each drawing 500 ma, that's more than the computer gives you, and something will have to be removed without external power. The wallwart is usually a 5.5V, 2A or less power supply so that each usb port can have the full 500ma on a 4 port hub, neglecting the data rates which are transparently handled on usb 2.0As for cables, the standard USB cable was defined as 6 feet, just like power cords are 6 feet most commonly. Following the power cord tradition, USB offered a 10 foot extension for a maximum distance of 16 feet before the signal degraded too much to be usable. Hence you'll find 10 foot PASSIVE extension cables in the $9 price range, which you can combine with your existing 6 foot cable for 16 feet total.The real advantage here is there is a low power (&lt;50mA) 1 port" hub at the end of this 16 foot extension - that regenerates your high speed usb signals for your device. It does steal some power, allowing 450 mA for the device, but most devices don't complain about not having the full 500 mA to themselves with a few exceptions for battery containing devices that must charge and disk drives that get their power from the usb cable.Now at the end of this you can put another 10 foot extension and 6 foot cable for 32 feet of total length if needed for outdoor or room to room usb. It's a great product to get around the 10 foot extension common length limit.Often I have "usb radio fobs" or radio transmitters for wireless keyboards. By putting them high up the wall and onto the ceiling, I can carry the wireless device that works with the fob a long ways away - much further than if the fob is hidden down behind the pc chassis on the floor. The 16 feet gives me adequate length to go over then up the wall and into the center of the room for best coverage.Overall I much prefer the active extension cable to the passive since the signal received at the PC will be just as good as if the device were plugged directly in. Tripp Lite uses a well shielded cable for exceptional quality and very low signal loss in the run back to the PC. While priced more, it is an active hub and you get that added value from the product."

I myself have the HP iPaq 1910, which I'm very happy with. I recently bought a V35 for my cousin's birthday, and also got a chance to play with it extensively. So my comments are more of a comparison with the 1910.The V35 is about the same thickness as the 1910, but slight longer and wider. While specs say that it's also slightly heavier than the 1910, you can't really tell the difference, since both are very lightweight. Because the 1910 has more of a metallic feel while the V35 feels more plasticky (which is not to say the latter feels cheap!), there's an illusion that the V35 is actually lighter than the 1910. The bottomline is, the V35 feels very good in the hand, and its non-shiny, non-slippery surface makes it much easier to hold than the 1910.Both the V35 and 1910 have 3.5 diagonal transflexive screens, and both are bright and beautiful. I think the 1910's screen sports richer colors, whereas the V35's is very slightly washed out, but still much better than the display on my old Audiovox Maestro (made by Toshiba). Like the 1910, the V35's touch screen is very responsive, and the backlighting is perfectly even.While both models accommodate SD memory cards, the V35 has the added advantage of being SDIO compatible, although, admittedly, there aren't many (or any) SDIO devices here in the States right now. Part of V35's system memory is accessible as "flash storage," but the 1910 still has a bit more useable memory onboard.My most positive impression of the V35 is it's well built and feels good in the hand, vs. 1910's slippery, easy-to-break feel. The battery life is also longer than the 1910; my estimate is 3.5 hours on average (playing MP3 files from a Lexar 256MB SD card with screen turned off) vs. 2-2.5 hours for the 1910. The V35 also comes with a docking cradle and a slip case, both of which are missing in the 1910 kit.On the downside the V35's battery is not user-replaceable. (The 1910's is, and it has a back-up battery to conserve data in case of a completely dead main battery.) Given that the typical LiIon battery has a recycle life of about 500 times, if you charge the V35 once a day, the battery will die out in about 18 months. Of course, in reality the battery probably won't completely die by then, but its capacity/useable time will definitely be shortened considerably. (Just ask any Palm V user who bought the Palm more than 2 years ago.)If I had to pick my Pocket PC again, I'd have a very hard time deciding between the iPaq 1910 and the V35. If you don't have to have the smallest and sleekist Pocket PC, I highly recommend the V35 for its longer battery life, included cradle and case, and SDIO-capable expansion.In the end, though, you may just grab whatever is cheaper. :)"
I'm using this item to connect my Canon Mini DV camcorder to a Panasonic DVD Recorder and it works fine. I would point out the connectors are not gold plated as they appear in the picture.
This CD tower by Atlantic really does hold 60 CDs in their jewel cases. It is compact and it's certainly no eyesore. I use this rack to store CDs and I have been rather satisfied.Another wonderful feature of this CD storage tower is that it requires no assembly. This comes in handy for persons like me who are all thumbs." It can be stored just about anywhere, too--at 21 inches high this storage tower is compact while doing the job of storing your CDs in an orderly and presentable fashion.The rack is constructed of black wire with "cherrywood" knobs. Caution: at this price you shouldn't expect real wood knobs. The "cherrywood" knobs look somewhat like fake wood or laminate. This is a minor disappointment, however.My only complaint is that the CD jewel cases often slide to one side or the other as they rest in their slots in this storage tower. Unless you are rather careful the CDs eventually look a bit disorderly; but again this is a minor complaint and it may not bother you.Overall, if you want an inexpensive CD storage rack this is the way to go. It is affordable, requires no assembly and lasts forever. Get one and use it in good health!"
This is the original factory replacement antenna for BOTH the astro transmitter and the handheld receiver. It is very flexible and easily conforms as the dog wearing it crawls under/over blockages to get to their prey. If you are replacing a missing or broken antenna, you probably want to go with this unless it is for a vehicle (ATV or 4WD) then check the high gain magnetic mount. The low profile antenna is not recommended for VHF frequencies.This antenna also has a gasket bottom that will seal up when screwed onto the astro base ensuring it is waterproof once mounted.
The DVD-1810 portable DVD player, also sold under the Mintek brand (which I earlier reviewed here on Amazon), brings affordability to on-the-road DVD entertainment. The player also plays CDs, VCDs, SVCDs, and also DVD-R/RW (I haven't tested it with DVD+R/RW as I don't have that media, so don't know if it can play it).I picked this model for its 8-inch gorgeous screen and unbeatable price. It even comes with a car adapter as well as AC cables (RCA type). The screen is very good, has wide-screen [but see the other review for tip on making it work correctly], and the battery lasts about 2 hours at the highest brightness setting.The machine itself is a little over an inch thick, but the battery snaps to the bottom and will add another half an inch. The whole thing (player + battery) weighs in at about 2-2.5 pounds... You can use the brick-style AC adapter with the player directly if you don't need the battery (e.g., when using it at home). Battery charging takes about 6 hours, so that's a department where the manufacturer can improve a bit.The player has simulated surround sound, but you should get a good pair of headphones to take full advantage of that; the built-in speakers are unsurprsingly pretty lame. (Hint: any good Sony headphones will make a great addition. The player does not come with headphones.) All the other standard DVD features are there, and you can also zoom in and zoom out. Zooming in, however, results in pixelated images, so it's not really useful to me, but some may find the feature of value. The package also includes a full-function DVD remote that's powered by a watch battery.The build quality of this Chinese-made product is decent. Nothing is loose or feels flimsy, but it's definitely not as well put together as electronics made in Japan. For example, you'll find Panasonic portable DVD players feel more solid and confident, but I have had my Initial for a few months now and it works totally fine and there's been no problems. (Knock on wood.)I'm very happy with my DVD-1810 and take it everywhere I go. I just need to recharge it every night. I highly recommend this tremendous value if you are in the market for a portable DVD player.
I haven't owned a Sony digital camera in years. Not that Sony cameras are not good; it's just that I always ended up getting a Canon, a Casio, a Fujifilm, a Minolta, a Kodak, or a Pentax. At the moment I use my Nikon D70 for photos that I want to keep or submit for contests, and my Fujifilm F10 for everyday snapshots. But recently I had a chance to play with a Sony DSC-N1 and I was really impressed. I think I'll buy a Sony next time, now that I've accumulated quite a number of Memory Stick PRO Duo cards (for my Sony PSP and Sony camcorders).OK, everyboby knows the N1 has 8.1MP resolution, and the price point is sweet for an ultra-slim, stylish digital camera. The 3x optical zoom is a bit disappointing; I really wish Sony had done something outside the box and gone beyond 3x zoom. (Panasonic has a compact camera that sports a whopping 10x optical zoom coupled with optical image stabilization!) 3x is adequate for most situations, though, so maybe it's no big deal for most casual shooters.But more than the 8.1MP resolution, which makes great enlarged prints, the N1 has excellent image quality. I always say that image quality is much more than resolution; it's more about color reproduction (is red really red and is blue really blue?) and white balance (is white really white?) as well as technical factors like saturation and contrast. Older Sony digital cameras tended to give crisp but dreadful looking pictures. Not the N1. Both indoor and outdoor pictures look terrific, and as long as you have adequate lighting (or use the flash), you'll get pictures that you'll be proud to share with friends. Digital noise does kick in quite a bit at ISO 400, meaning that in dim light situations you'll notice digital specks when you enlarge the picture. But for 4x6, or even 5x7", prints as well as viewing on a PC monitor or HDTV monitor, the N1's image quality comes across as quite satisfactory. What really impressed me was the flash quality, which seemed better than most other compact digital cameras (except Canon ones).So if you want a digital camera with excellent image quality, the N1 should be on your shopping list. Overall I still slightly prefer Canon's image quality, but not by much, just by a little bit. It's probably because my idea of "perfect" image quality matches the calibration parameters chosen by Canon's engineers. However, I know many other people who prefer Sony's crispier looks or Fuji's "scenic, natural" looks, so you may want to compare the N1 with a Canon or something else to see which camera produces the results you personally like the most. Bottomline: the N1's image quality ranks very high among compact digital cameras.Of course, the N1 has many other things going for it, too, like the enormous 3" LCD in the back. The LCD just looks huge because 1) it is, and 2) it takes up most of the real estate of the camera's back. Its resolution is a little over 230k, twice that of most other digital camera's LCDs. This gives a sharp-looking image on the LCD. Ourdoor visibility is good as the LCD is bright. Like Sony's camcorders, this LCD is touch-sensitive, which means you can control camera functions on the LCD itself. I myself am neutral on this. Some people don't like Sony's menu-driven interface and would have preferred a few more buttons. For most casual photographers, this is probably not going to be a big deal.The N1 is beautiful looking, and it has good shooting performance. I'm talking shutter lag here. It's quite fast. Not as fast as a digital SLR like my Nikon D70 or a Canon Digital Rebel XT, but the N1 felt slightly faster than my Fuji F10. This is a camera that performs, period.Battery life is decent; I think the official rating is 300 according to the Japanese CIPA standard. My Fuji F10 is rated at 450 and I swear I've taken close to 1,000 photos (about 40% with flash) and I still have 50% left. I don't know if the N1's battery has the same stamina as my F10. But even at 300 shots per charge, that's pretty good.I want to make two recommendations to any perspective N1 owner:1) Be sure to get a spare battery. Even though the N1's battery life is good, the battery might fail (e.g., in extreme temperatures) or you might forget to recharge it before a new day starts. Always carry a spare if you can afford it.2) The N1 uses Memory Stick Duo, and you'll most likely buy the "PRO" version. (The "PRO" designation simply means the Memory Stick Duo card is over 256MB. Sony's marketing people are nothing short of absolutely stupid and perverted.) You don't have to buy the "high-speed" (red) version of Memory Stick Duo PRO; but as a fellow Amazonian recently told me, the high-speed and regular versions cost the same, so you might as well get the high-speed one. Now comes my tip: buy two or more memory cards instead of a single gigantic-capacity one. Say you want 2GB in total. Get two 1GB Memory Stick PRO Duo cards instead of a single 2GB one. Why? It's the old adage that "don't put all your eggs in one basket." As with the battery, always carry a spare. Trust me, if you don't have a spare battery or memory card, Murphy's Law will get you, sooner than you think, too.In summary, the N1 is a terrific ultra-slim camera. It takes great pictures, is stylish, has a huge touch-sensitive LCD, has good battery life, is reasonably easy to use, and did I mention it takes great pictures? It's good enough for this camera aficionado that my next compact camera will probably be a Sony."
As with all Lowepro camera gear the quality is exceptional. I was first given the smaller version of this (the -1) on the amazon vine program - I used it for my dad's olympus E300 camera but it did not fit my olympus E3 with the battery extender underneath. I bought the -2 larger version for twenty bucks and was very impressed by the value. Underneath the pouch there is a velcro compartment with a rain poncho in case you get into wet weather. There is also a belt loop, handle on top, and a shoulder strap to carry the camera. It's fast to get into by loading from the top and can accommodate longer lenses than the -1 version of the bag.As an example of the bag's quality design, there is a zipper inside that seals the inside pouch for media. Even the zipper is covered by a leather flap to protect the camera from scratches caused by the zipper. Ordinary cases would just use velcro or omit the leather flap to protect the camera resulting in scratched camera equipment.Basically I was so pleased with the construction of the -1 that I tried that I bought the -2 for myself. The quality of the -2 size is the same as the size 1 version, and the -2 version has a larger pocket on the outside and inside to store accessories. Plus I can put my E3 with the dual battery attachment into the -2 size bag as well as a longer lens.I've already found the bag handy to have on hand with my camera to catch an event quickly. Without it I would not have brought my camera with me. It's a very well built with padding all over and economical at this price, prefect for my olympus e3.
This new line of flash-based, coin-like (but they are thick coins, esp. in the waist!) MP3/ATRACT players from Sony are the latest models of their Psyc line of digital music players. The new-age styling of these MP3 players does psyc you out. Which is not a bad thing, as they are more euro-cool than the rather bland and boring iPod and the downright butt-ugly iRiver. The more I look at the Psyc, the more I like its looks.The new silver Psyc MP3 player features 1GB of flash memory, which is great for those of you jogger jocks out there. You can shake this thing violently and it won't skip a beat, unlike those hard drive-based players. Before you insert an AAA battery, the Psyc weighs in at an amazingly light 0.9 oz. -- that's right, folks, it's less than an ounce! With the AAA battery, my guess is it's about 2 oz. It's very small although, relatively speaking, it looks a little thick -- esp. in the middle area where the single AAA battery resides. (About 0.75 in. at its thickest part.)What, you ask, it uses an AAA battery? Yes my friend, and this one AAA alkaline battery can power the player up to 70 hours! That's almost three full days of continuous playing. The phrase up to" here means that in order to get all 70 hours of playing, you must 1) play ATRAC3Plus songs encoded at 48kbps and 2) do not press buttons or do random play (i.e., just leave the player playing sequentially). In the real life we like to skip a song, fast forward, random play (a.k.a. shuffle play), turn it on and off and on and off, and most importantly, we play MP3 songs. All these operations reduce the battery life. Given my experience with previous Sony MP3 players, my estimate is one good AAA battery should last you 40 hours or more. (With my beloved Sony NW-HD3, I routinely get the advertised battery life of 30 hours even when playing MP3 files.)Of course, the use of AAA means you get an abundant and ready supply of cheap power source, and you can trek in the Amazon for weeks on end without having to worry about finding an AC outlet.The Psyc also comes in three other colors (green and blue for the 512MB version, and orange for the 256MB version). It has a nice, sharp backlit LCD screen, so you always know what you are playing as opposed to having to guess as on some other certain MP3 player. It plays MP3 as well as Sony's ATRAC songs. If you are an ATRAC fan you'll like the sound quality of this little player; it's at least as good as Sony's MD players. For MP3's, the sound quality is a bit "muffled" compared to my NW-HD3 20GB player, but still quite good if you pair it with a good pair of headphones (i.e., ditch the stock earphones).Sony still has a long, long way to go in the user interface department, as this has always been its weakness, whether it's digital music or digital video or anything else. The Psyc is not hard to use; its basic functions are no-brainers. But, for anything beyond play/pause/skip, its interface, whether on the unit itself or on the PC transfer side, is still not polished and was clearly designed for a Japanese audience -- Japanese consumers reportedly love to play with complicated gadgets; no surprise given how elaborate sushi-making and origami are. We American consumers like things that are elegant and simple, and Sony has a lot of room for improvement in this regard.In short, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the new Psyc flash-based MP3 players. They are stylish and lightweight and lasts forever on cheap AAA batteries. They have good sound quality and are priced right. Just be prepared to spend some time with the manual and experimenting a little with transfering music. If you are stuck, you are welcome to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail with your questions.Recommended."
This is spec'ed as working on the e300 and e1 - I bought an E3 after having used several E300s with this adapter and found they used the same square power input on it and the voltage was the same so it works on those 3 at a minimum. Not sure about the newer (after E3) cameras.With the more modern cameras the need for an AC adapter is falling off due to reduced power consumption. If you use the live view screen alot for studio work then this adapter might be helpful. Another alternative is to double the battery capacity with theOlympus HLD-4 POWER BATTERY HOLDER E-3HLD4 which gives you the option of 1 or 2 li-ion packs, a second compliment of knobs and buttons for portrait mode, and also a 6 cell AA battery pack for emergencies.Having used the HLD4 on 2 different E3s I should warn people the AA option never seems to be the right voltage on the E3. With fresh alkaline AAs, the low power indicator comes on almost instantly, and with lithium (E91) AAs its the same story. When using 2 normal li-ion packs that came with the camera, however, it runs for more than twice the usual run time so an all day shoot is no problem.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Delkin 128MB Secure Digital Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Excellent product - works exactly the same as the Canon brand. I counted the pages and I got approximately the same number of pages. No clogups in fact, I believe I cleaned the heads less than I had to with the genuine replacement cartridge.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The PNY 64MB SmartMedia Flash Memory Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I usually recommend LCD TVs (esp. Sharp Aquos) over plasmas, mainly because the LCD screen lasts longer, is brighter, consumes far less electricity, and does not suffer the burn-in problem as plasmas.But if you are set on getting a plasma, this Panasonic Veira" 42" is one of the best plasmas on the market today. This HDTV set (with built-in HDTV tuner) is fully 720p and 480p native, and can scale 1080i content gracefully. (BTW there's very little 1080i content available right now.) The picture quality is simply gorgeous, with brightness and details that rival LCDs. Color reproduction is excellent, making watching Nature on PBS such a wonderful experience. The screen's response time has improved over earlier models, so fast-action sports looks good instead of ghostly. The Veira also has a Cable Card slot and although I haven't tried it, a recent New York Times review says it works seamlessly with Cable Cards. (Cable Cards can replace set-top cable boxes; check with your cable provider for details.)To get the most out of DVD movies, get a digital-output (HDMI) DVD player from Panasonic, Sony or Denon. These players can "upsample" DVD's standard-NTSC resolution and provide somewhat better video quality when you play DVDs on an HDTV like this one. The Panasonic player in particular is a great value and a perfect match for the Veira.While I still think LCD TVs are a better value for the long term, the Panasonic, along with plasmas from Fujitsu and Pioneer, does give you the best possible picture out of today's state-of-the-art plasma technology. I have friends who own Panasonic and they are all very happy, even the ones with the EDTV (instead of HDTV) sets.When you buy a big screen TV, you are making a serious investment (unless you just won the Mega Millions or Powerball), and I highly recommend you buy the best you can afford. Sub-$2000 plasma TVs have poor image quality and are likely to break down quickly, plus they are very noisy. Just go for the best after you get over the SAF (spouse approval factor) hurdle! The Panasonic Veira is a great value considering its top-notch image quality, gorgeous styling and built-in HDTV support."
I recently bought and returned the YH925GS. Not only did it not have an FM tuner (didn't care that much), but adding, modifying, and deleting files was becoming a BIG pain.The MP3 player is pretty slim, even though it's not the slimmest one you can buy, it's light so if you like jogging with it or excersising you'll barely notice it. Like all 20 GB MP3 players, you can store 5,000 songs (approx. 400 CDs). The controls look strange at first, but actually, all you need to control is the touchpad. There are also arrows for them most easy navigation. You'll notice that it's easier to use than most MP3 players on the market today. The battery life is 16 hours. Some of today's players have more than 20 hours, but I guess 16 is okay.The player also comes with a 1.8 LCD screen, and more colors than a computer so your photos will look of professional quality. On this player, something that most if not all players can't do, is view .txt files. This is a really cool feature. You can store lyrics or essays in Notepad, then transfer them into the player. This is a VERY cool feature that I will be using more often.The sound is really good. It doesn't have WOW features that most MP3 players have, but it has a very decent equalizer. The sound isn't distored at all, and I'm suprised about this.The player also comes with recordings and FM tuning. THe microphone can pick up voice pretty far, and the FM tuner is quite good too. There are also 20-preset stations for your tuner. And listen to this one, you can rip off of the radio. How cool is that? Say your listen to the radio, and you hear this hot new track that is so good, you can just press record, and you can listen to it whenever you want. It's not that other players don't do this, it's that this is the 1 of 2 players that has the fantasic combination of 20 GB, Radio, and Recording. (the iAudio X5 is the other player that has this...I didn't buy it because it doesn't allow you to change track settings, WTF?)It's also PlaysForSure compatible, but to use WMP 10, you have to download the drivers from the iRiver website. Unless you have a lot of music on WMP, I would just stick to the drag-n-drop. It's not just drag-n-drop (e.g. My Computer, iRiver) or WMP 10 that's compatable. RealPlayer is compatable, and Napster is too (but I think Napster sucks). To put photos on your MP3 player, you can use the manual drag-n-drop. As a matter of fact, the My Computer>iRiver method is probably the best. I have no reason why you would want/need WMP 10 or Real to manage music. Though, I guess to have further options, you would need it. But otherwise, it's VERY easy to add tracks since you can drag-n-drop. But remember, if you can't get Windows to understand the H10, you'll need to go to iRiver's website and download the new drivers. I wish they would give you the drivers beforehand, because some people with computers may not have internet.Overall, if you want the great combination of 20 GB, WMA and MP3, Recording, Drag-N-Drop (no hassle with WMP or Real), and FM radio, you just HAVE to have the H10."
The battery was purchased for my son's Zen, as a back-up. It works great. Amazon shipped everything quickly - I couldn't be more happy with their service
This lightweight wireless optical mouse from Microsoft continues the company's solid line of input devices. The best features of this mouse compared to the competition are:1) Excellent precision. As a pointer device you really want the mouse to go where it should, so precision is very important. As with other MS optical mouses (BTW, we uber-geeks call them mouses", and we call the furry rodents "mice"), this one is high-precision. It's almost like the mouse knows where you want the pointer to be.2) Responsive. A click is a click. A lot of wireless mouses tend to miss a click or two often, but not this one.3) Comfortable. I suffer from carpal tunnel. This mouse is one of the most comfortable ones I've used, although it's still not perfect and still causes wrist and palm pains after I use it for an extended period of time.4) Good battery life and pure plug-n-play.This mouse is optical, so works on any flat surface except glass and mirror. It's also free from lint and dust that can plague a traditional mouse's ball bad. I can't comment on its range since I have the transmitter on my desk so it's pretty close to the mouse itself.This is an excellent mouse because it's easy to set up, easy to use, and comfortable to hold. I highly recommend it."
I have a confession to make: I bought this Orange Micro IEEE 1394 cable on Amazon only because it was the cheapest IEEE 1394 cable I could find anywhere. But when I received the cable, I was impressed with the easy-to-open packaging and the big letters Assembled in USA". Proud and anxious, I set out to test the cable right away, and was happy to find it a competent cable. Have used it to transfer multiple gigabytes of data between my Sony MiniDV camcorder and Fujitsu laptop with no problems whatsoever. If you are looking for an IEEE 1394 cable, this is the one to get, and there's no justification for paying 3-6 times more for other brands."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.

I ordered 2 different chargers to maintain my gate opener's deep cycle battery (a simple 4 output charger with extension cords for charging other deep cycle batteries from amazonBattery Tender 022-0148-DL-WH 12V 4-Bank Battery Management System) and this unit has a far superior charging design.The 4 bank battery tender does a simple fast rate charge then switches to a trickle charge at a constant voltage with 4 outputs.This unit pulses the battery under charge and features 3 operating modes with different current outputs for different sized batteries. The selections are motorcycle which also works well for SLA gel cells or AGM batteries, standard automotive starting battery, deep cycle batttery, and off.What makes the CTEK unit special is that it uses a pulse charge in all modes to attempt to desulphate batteries, while the battery tender does not. This method of charging has proven successful in restoring lead acid batteries that won't take a charge any more.It comes with a waterproof 12V output cable and a set of clips or rings for permanent installation under the hood of your car. In addition to the LEDs for indicating the type of battery being charged, a second set is provided for empty, 1/2 full, and maintenance pulse charge mode.There is also a noticable increase in quality between the battery tender and this unit - small details like a water sealed housing and gaskets on the connectors indicate quality in manufacture.For a single 12V lead chemistry battery this is a useful, well made tool.
I bought this cable from Eforcity becuase it is very cheap and gets many positive reviews. This cable is used to connect my PS3 and the TV in my bedroom, I'm very suprised it provides the excellent performance as same as the Monster cable that is used for my blue-ray player. I like this cable very much and I bought 2 more for my parents.

This is definitely not your typical speaker system, although it can be configured that way with the transformer selector switch set to the 8 ohm position. The speakers do come with mounting brackets, gold plated wire connectors, and have an 8 ohm mode for use with conventional amplifiers. The tap transformer (more on this later) maxes out at 10 watts.For those unfamiliar with 70 volt line speakers" and amplifiers, read on, for those who use 70V line systems just skip to the last paragraph as I explain why these speakers have a wattage knob on the back.Most people never get experience using 70V line speaker systems as they are not used on home stereos where all speakers are within a few feet of the amplifier. Good quality heavy gague speaker wire prevents loss here When trying to run long distances between the amplifier and multiple speakers such as an office paging system or an outdoor sound system the high voltage (70 Volts) line method has an advantage just as high voltage does for home power distribution. The concept is the same - by using transformers at both the amplifier and speaker you avoid costly losses in long distance wire runs.Most high end home amplifiers have outputs to drive 4 ohm or 8 ohm speakers and connect quite simply. In a 70V line speaker system there are 3 distinct differences:1 - the amplifier's output has a step up transformer that provides a nominal 70 VAC output instead of expecting an 8 ohm speaker load. The output may be any type of 2 wire connector and is marked "70V line"2 - multiple (10 or more) speakers can be connected simply to this pair of wires without substantial loss. There is no need to run special high grade wire to 70V speaker systems, 22ga wire is more than adequate for small systems. Speakers can be wired easily with all the positive or red terminals connected together and the same for the black or negative terminals. This can not be done with a normal home amplifier system using conventional 8 ohm speakers as each one added would double the work on the amplifier until it failed.3 - Although most 70V systems are mono, two or more amplifier systems can be installed to provide stereo or multichannel sound to larger venues. In really large outdoor venues up to a half mile long, delay lines may be incorporated so that the sound arrives to the listener at the same timeThe volume, or technically the power delivered to each speaker is adjusted at each speaker using a dial or switch on the speaker, often marked in watts from 0.5W to 10 or more watts. In an office paging system this makes it convenient to setup quiet speakers in cubicles and loudspeakers in warehouse spaces or noisy machine rooms. The central amplifier volume adjustment is usually left fixed. The main amplifier is chosen based on its power rating which should be more than the sum of the speaker settings connected to it.For example, a small office has 10 ceiling speakers set to 1Watt, a shop with a 5 watt speaker, and a warehouse with a 20watt bullhorn type speaker. Multiply the 10 office speakers by 1 watt each, they consume 10W off the 70V line, add in the 5 and 20 watt speakers for the noisy areas and your speaker load is 35W, so a 100 watt amplifier would provide room to spare and not be overloaded.These spakers have a unique selector that in addition to the wattage adjustments for 70V use, they also have an 8 ohm setting for use with conventional amplifiers. The materials are damp-proof but for outdoor mounting they should be kept out of direct rain such as mounting under the eaves. With this combination of features you can extend your livingroom stereo outside or use the same speaker for office paging systems. Their professional construction and brackets are excellent features all the way around."
The Tamrac System 3 camera bag is perfect for SLR owners who also have one or two compact lenses (e.g., the typical 28-200mm or 70-300mm zoom lens) in addition to the lens attached to the camera, plus a small external flash. The bag is small compared to other SLR gadget bags, but the inside can be partitioned in flexible ways. It's also well-padded, both inside and outside. It also has lining pockets for things like USB cables, camera body cap, lens caps, filters, etc. At the front, there's a compartment for miscellaneous items such as film, memory cards, pens, lens cleaning paper, etc. Hidden behind this is a pull-out pouch for batteries and memory cards, plus an ID tag (kinda hard to write on, though). You can also use the compartment this pouch is in to store film, etc, although stuff might fall out if you are not careful. At the back is another compartment, which I use to store the manual of my Nikon D70.As you can see, this small" bag is very versatile. In addition, you can get Tamrac's add-on pouches and pockets to attach to the strap or the sides of the bag, for additional storage.I looked at many bags before settling on this one. It's compact and weighs about 1.5 pounds, so it's material enough to withstand tough conditions yet light enough for shoulder-use. As I mentioned it's also well padded and can accommodate extensions. If you are the typical SLR enthusiast with a total of 2-3 compact lenses and/or a small flash unit, you'll find this bag a very good fit for your needs."
It's the most stunning idea, isn't it? This top of the line MacBook Pro is the fastest Mac Notebook ever, and probably one of the fastest Macs period.When Steve Jobs announced the new Macs, with Intel Core Duo processors I was almost certain I wanted to buy one. Why? Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch. That all changed in January 2006.Processor in the new MacBook ProThe Intel Core Duo processor in the new MacBook Pro is an amazing chip. What have I noticed about the speed of the machine featuring this chip? It is incredibly fast. You'd be surprised by how much faster even web browsing is, when you have a processor as powerful as the Core Duo. However, what I've really been impressed by is doing things such as video encoding. I've encoded videos in H264 as much as eight times faster than my Powerbook G4. Furthermore, the iLife applications that are included on the MacBook Pro fly, with the speed. iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, and Garageband perform like never before. I've really been impressed by the speed.The Core Duo is a great processor. It offers exceptional desktop PC performance, in a design that can fit in small computers and notebooks. It features two cores on a single die, which effectively gives you the performance of two processors. Don't let the 2 GHZ clock speed fool you. This Core Duo Chip will outperform 3+ GHZ Pentium 4 processors. It really is an amazing breakthrough, from Intel.Video CardThe new MacBook Pro 2 GHZ model features an ATI Radeon X1600 graphics processor using PCI Express 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory. This is the best graphic card Apple has *ever* included in a notebook. This graphic processor will work well for most gaming, and it is great for viewing back complex H264 movies, including high definition videos. You can enjoy high definition H264 videos, without drop frames.Ports -The MacBook Pro features 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 Firewire 400 port, Gigabit Ethernet, audio in/out, and Expresscard (34 slot).Display - Apple touts the display on the new MacBook Pro as bright as the cinema displays, and there is no question: these displays are bright! Depending on your lighting condition, you'll almost certainly not turn the display to full brightness. I had to turn down the brightness, for it was hard on my eyes. However, it is nice to know the brightness is there, when needed. The native resolution is 1440x900 giving you plenty of screen real estate, to keep the applications you need visible.Video out - The new MacBook Pro has a DVI video output. An adapter is also included to output VGA. There is an optional adapter available to output S-Video and composite video. Furthermore, the DVI video out supports up to a 30-inch Apple Cinema Display (or other comparable display). This gives you great possibilities. You can easily use your MacBook Pro on the road, but plug it into a keyboard, mouse, and huge display, when at your desk. The perfect all around system.Memory - This Mac is a powerhouse and 1 GB of memory (thats included) will get you started nicely. However, you may consider adding even more memory at some point. The MacBook Pro supports up to 2 GB of memory. It uses PC5300 DDR2 - SODIMM modules.Applications -Apple includes iLife '06, which has iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and Garageband. There is the Safari web browser, the always useful iCal, AddressBook, iChat, etc. Overall, I was pleased with the included software.iLife 06 is particularly great. I love the new full-screen photo editing, photo comparing, etc. You can now also order calendars and greeting cards made with your photos, direct from Apple, by using the iPhoto software. iMovie has new themes, which helps make professional-looking home movies, and iDVD now supports widescreen DVDs. iWeb is a brand-new applications, which makes it easy to create professional quality webpages, quickly. I can't wait to rebuild by site using iWeb. Apple continues to make it easy to create music, manage your digital images, make movies, and create web sites.A trial (30 day) of iWork '06 is also included, which includes the page layout program Pages, and the presentation program Keynote (which makes presentations that blow away presentations made by rival Powerpoint).Hard Drive -This model of the MacBook Pro includes a 100 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. This is going to be sufficient for most people to hold their photographs, music, and some videos. However, others will need more space, so you can always use an external drive, when at your desk. It is also important that you remember to backup your important files to either another external hard drive, or DVDs. I only point this out because today with great machines like the MacBook Pro we're storing more of our great memories on computers than ever before, so make sure you don't lose them, if something happens to your machine. Apple includes a great backup program called Backup 3, if you subscribe to the .mac service. I use it all the time, and it simple interface helps me keep peace of mind.Superdrive-The optical drive included with the new MacBook Pro allows you to watch DVDs, listen to music, burn DVDs, and burn CDs. It is a slot-loading drive, so the disks slide magically in and out of the computer's right side. There are no drawers to break off. Note - The drive does *not* burn dual layer DVDs.Front Row Experience - Apple has included a new software title that at this time is only available on the iMac, Mac Mini, and MacBook Pro. Front Row. Front Row comes with your MacBook Pro, and a remote control is also included. Front row allows you to watch and listen to media items, on your computer, from across the room. Click one button on the remote, and bring up Front Row, for quick access to your music, movies, podcasts, DVD, and more. I like this feature, but I wonder how useful it is, since I'm usually sitting right in front of the computer and can just use a mouse, to access this content.PowerPC Applications on Intel MachineIf you own a lot of software for Mac, then most of it is probably compiled for PowerPC. Developers are working hard to make titles run natively on both Intel and PowerPC, but many titles are not yet ready. However, many titles you can use on an Intel Mac because Apple has included Rosetta, which translates the PowerPC code into something the Intel machine can read. However, you never see Rosetta for it works quietly in the background and makes running PowerPC applications seamless. Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta. Intensive applications such as Photoshop will run under Rosetta, but it will be slower until Adobe has an Intel compiled version of Photoshop. Rosetta does work and if you add memory to your iMac, you may find such application somewhat equal to how it would perform on a 1GHZ PowerPC G4, from my experience.Two titles I use EyeTV and Toast 7 are not yet compiled for Intel, but they run fine on my Intel Mac, under Rosetta. Again, you don't have to open anything special to use Rosetta. Your Mac knows when it needs it and uses it.Wireless- The MacBook Pro can still connect wirelessly to networks using its included Airport Card. Furthermore, it features a Bluetooth module to connect wirelessly to devices.Design - This MacBook Pro is beautiful, and you notice the quality as soon as you begin to open the box. It is packaged with care, in beautiful packaging. The MacBook Pro is thin, and the display is beautiful. The Mag Safe Power Connector is another amazing design feature on this machine. If someone or something pulls on the power cord connected to your notebook, instead of the notebook flying, the magnet on the connector releases, leaving your MacBook Pro safe.Overall, I am very excited about the MacBook Pro. It is incredibly fast on Intel-native applications, and it does a very good job running PowerPC applications. If you're upgrading from a G4 Mac like myself, this machine will seem to fly. If you're upgrading from a G5 based Mac, it will be faster on native applications, but the increase in performance will be less significant to you. The Intel machines are the future of Apple, so there is no question this is a good machine, and it is powerful enough to be a good computer, for quite some time. I'm happy with my purchase, and I look forward to continue exploring my Intel Mac in the coming days
If you divide dollars per gigabyte, the Extreme III 8.0 GB card represents the cost knee where you get the most bang for the buck. The 12GB is higher, as is the 4 GB in %/GB. At 8GB as I write this in November 2007 it is the best value in memory cards. Now tomorrow Amazon may re-price everything and this may not be true - so be sure to divide dollars by gigabytes in the 4, 8 and 12 cards unless you just want the biggest -- then buy the 12 GB. They all perform wonderfully fast on devices with firmware to handle the fast read/write CF interface. I'm using it with an E300 camera from Olympus and found the camera was the limiting factor in write speed compared to using it on my computer. With 8GB you can take hundreds of uncompressed photos at maximum resolution using your 8-12 Megapixel camera. Compare that with the old 36 exposure roll of film and you see how convenient it is to never have to open your camera and load film!Keep on shooting!
Without question, I love Macintosh computers. The ease of use, performance, and design that is Apple makes me productive, keeps the headaches down, and makes working on a computer fun.When Steve Jobs announced the new iMac, with Intel Core Duo processors I was almost certain I wanted to buy it. Why? Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch.

This graphic processor will work well for most gaming, and it is great for viewing back complex H264 movies, including high definition videos. You can enjoy high definition H264 videos, without drop frames. I couldn't even play these videos, on my Powerbook.Display - Apple's 20-inch displays are beautiful, and it is built right into the iMac. The iMac is so thin too that people sometimes think the computer is only the LCD. For example, friends of mine didn't believe me, when I said the computer was behind the LCD! Back to the display's quality, it is very bright, crisp, and clean. It is also easy on the eyes, which is nice, when you're sitting at the machine for several hours. It features 1680x1050 resolution, which will give you plenty of room to fit windows and projects onto the screen.Video out - The new iMac, for the first time ever, features a Mini-DVI output. This allows, with adapters, the ability to connect the iMac to a DVI display, a television via composite or S-video, or an analog display via VGA. I have my new iMac Core Duo connected to my 20-inch Apple Cinema Display, and it works perfect! A nice feature. This allows for screen-spanning, so I can take advantage of both screens.Memory - This iMac is a powerhouse, but it is held back by the standard 512MB of memory. You can still do a couple tasks at a time, but for intensive tasks and multitasking you need more memory. Add at least another 512 MB stick, for a total of 1 GB memory, but you might consider adding even more. The iMac supports up to 2 GB of memory. It uses PC5300 DDR2 - SODIMM modules.Applications -Apple has removed some of the applications previously bundled, with the iMac. This includes Appleworks. Appleworks is no longer included, but if you own a copy, it will run fine on this machine. Apple does include iLife '06, which has iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and Garageband. There is the Safari web browser, some board games, the always useful iCal, AddressBook, iChat, etc. Overall, I was pleased with the included software.iLife 06 is particularly great. I love the new full-screen photo editing, photo comparing, etc. You can now also order calendars and greeting cards made with your photos, direct from Apple, by using the iPhoto software. iMovie has new themes, which helps make professional-looking home movies, and iDVD now supports widescreen DVDs. iWeb is a brand-new applications, which makes it easy to create professional quality webpages, quickly.

This is going to be sufficient for most people to hold their photographs, music, and movies. However, some people may need more. It is also important that you remember to backup your important files to either another external hard drive, or DVDs. I only point this out because today with great machines like the iMac we're storing more of our great memories on computers than ever before, so make sure you don't lose them, if something happens to your machine.

You can also burn dual-layer DVDs, which is nice. It is a slot-loading drive, so the disks slide magically in and out of the computer's right side. There are no drawers to break off.Front Row Experience - Apple has included a new software title that at this time is only available on the iMac and MacBook Pro. Front Row. Front Row comes with your iMac, and a remote control is also included. Front row allows you to watch and listen to media items, on your computer, from across the room. Click one button on the remote, and bring up Front Row, for quick access to your music, movies, podcasts, DVD, and more. I like this feature, but I wonder how useful it is, since I'm usually sitting right in front of the computer and can just use a mouse, to access this content.PowerPC Applications on Intel MachineIf you own a lot of software for Mac, then most of it is probably compiled for PowerPC. Developers are working hard to make titles run natively on both Intel and PowerPC, but many titles are not yet ready. However, many titles you can use on an Intel Mac because Apple has included Rosetta, which translates the PowerPC code into something the Intel machine can read. However, you never see Rosetta for it works quietly in the background and makes running PowerPC applications seamless. Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta. Intensive applications such as Photoshop will run under Rosetta, but it will be slower until Adobe has an Intel compiled version of Photoshop. Rosetta does work and if you add memory to your iMac, you may find such application somewhat equal to how it would perform on a 1GHZ PowerPC G4, from my experience.Two titles I use EyeTV and Toast 7 are not yet compiled for Intel, but they run fine on my Intel iMac, under Rosetta. Again, you don't have to open anything special to use Rosetta. Your Mac knows when it needs it and uses it.Wireless- The iMac can still connect wirelessly to networks using its included Airport Card. Furthermore, it features a Bluetooth module to connect wirelessly to devices.Design - This iMac is beautiful, and you notice the quality as soon as you begin to open the box. It is packaged with care, in beautiful packaging. The iMac is thin, and the display floats above your desk. Furthermore, Apple includes a nice keyboard and mighty mouse, which allows for multi-button clicking.Overall, I am very happy with my iMac Core Duo. It should perhaps come with more memory standard, but it is a very impressive machine. It is incredibly fast on Intel-native applications, and it does a very good job running PowerPC applications. If you're upgrading from a G4 Mac like myself, this machine will seem to fly. If you're upgrading from a G5 based Mac, it will be faster on native applications, but the increase in performance will be less significant to you. The Intel machines are the future of Apple, so there is no question this is a good machine, and it is powerful enough to be a good computer, for quite some time. I'm happy with my purchase, and I look forward to continue exploring it in the coming days
IMPORTANT UPDATE (Dec. 2005): Do NOT buy the official Nikon EN-EL3 battery! It has been recalled by Nikon due to short circuit hazard. Details can be found at nikonusa dot com (click the EN-EL3 battery recall" link). Repeat: this model has been recalled by Nikon, so do not buy. The EN-EL3a or EN-EL3b are compatible replacement models for the EN-EL3. Neither is subject to recall.My original review from Jan. 2005 follows:This "genuine" Nikon EN-EL3 battery works in the D70 and D100 digital SLR cameras. The origin can be either Japan or China; apparently Nikon outsources the manufacturing to other companies. (I was able to verify this countries of origin information on Nikon's website.) For $15 cheaper you can get a compatible battery made by a company that licenses Energizer's brand; just search for "EN-EL3" here on Amazon and pick the one that says "by Energizer." That one is also good and although it's a generic, it does have the Energizer name (even if not actually made by Energizer). You might want to check that out. Of course, if you are super-concerned about safety -- personal and equipment -- you should stick with the official Nikon-licensed battery, which is this one."
Compared to the Chinese imports (Apex, Initial, Cyberhome, etc.), the Panasonic DVD-LS5 is definitely a premium model, and both the price and quality show. If you just want to watch DVDs on the road and don't mind teeny sound or blocky images, the low-end models will serve you well. In fact I love my 8-inch Initial. On the other hand, if you want to truly enjoy a mobile DVD experience, you gotta buy this product.Better styling and build quality aside, the Panasonic has at least three significant advantages over non-Japanese players: 1) the screen is clearer and offers better viewing angles horizontally, so you can share the joy of DVD with another person; 2) the sound is just incredibly loud for a small player like this, unlike the low-end players -- in fact it feels almost like surround sound in a quiet room; 3) the tilting mechansim is really cool and allows you to adjust the screen angle freely.The battery snaps to the back (and raises the player a bit) and offers a little over 2 hours of viewing pleasure. All considered, the Panasonic player is also much more portable than the other ones; even with the battery installed we are talking something you can just grab and watch, as opposed to carrying in two hands.Is the Panasonic worth the extra money over the other players? I definitely think so.
I absolutely disagree with the other two reviewers. These plug-style stereo earphones are great, and here's why.First of all, I'd always been looking for neck strap earphones. In the summertime, it's just so inconvenient to leave my Sony NW-HD3 MP3 player in a pocket, even though it is tiny. Plus, when I walk around my apartment naked, there's no pocket to speak of! So I was so excited to finally see these headphones at my local Sony Style store. Now all my summertime problems are solved!(I was hoping to get the red version, which would have gone real well with my red NW-HD3, but I couldn't find it anywhere, including the Sony Style store here in Boston, so I ended up getting this white version online. If you have an mini or flash iPod, this white version will go pretty well with it.)In terms of sound quality, I have no complaints. Now, if I really want great sound, I put on my studio reference headphones and go crazy. But for daily commute and use at work (or when I do chores around my apartment), I prefer a lightweight, in-ear type of headphones, and this NX1 model is perfect. It has a good range, not too high-pitched nor bassy. There's definitely a lack of deep bass here -- although you can use your MP3 player's graphic equalizer to compensate for it, which I do on my NW-HD3. If you want a pair of earphones with terrific bass (and are willing to go deaf for it), this is not for you. For great-sounding pop and jazz and classical, I find the sound quality of this NX1 just right for casual listening. As sort of a semi-audiophile type, I'm pretty happy with the sound quality -- and I don't say this because I'm blindly loyal to the Sony brand. (If you search through my Amazon reviews, you'd see that I once rated one of their earphones 1 star and another one 2 stars.)Because the NX1 employs rubber earbuds, it can block a lot of noise. This is not active noise-cancelling as with the expensive Bose headphones, but because the earbuds fit in your ear canals -- the NX1 earphones come fitted with medium-sized earbuds but include both large and small buds in the package -- they passively block out external noise. I personally prefer this type (and the over-the-ear closed type of headphones) because 1) I've never had good luck with active noise-cancelling headphones, and 2) I really wonder whether the low-frequency noise-countering sound emittd by active noise-cancelling headphones will actually destroy your hearing over the long term.So, the NX1 is a stylish, high-quality pair of bud-style earphones. You can adjust the length of the cords as well as the segment with the audio connector.My only complaint, which is minor to me but could be a problem for you, is the segment that houses the audio connector is short. Its length is perfect for my NW-HD3 and NW-E105, but I imagine it could be a problem for some players.In a nutshell, the NX1 makes a great pair of earphones for summertime music listening, esp. if you wear clothing that has no pockets.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Kodak 128MB SD Card with Case, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
The JVC GRH-D1 was released two years ago as the world's first hi-def camcorder (at least the world's under-$5000 HD camcorder). It utilizes the new HDV format, developed by JVC and enhanced by Sony, JVC, Sharp and Canon. The GRH-D1 is by now the granddaddy" of HDV camcorders but it's great for those aspiring to shoot HD video. It has a comfortable grip, great image quality, and loads of pro features. The iamge quality is definitely excellent. Shop around to find this for around $2000."
It charges the battery as promised, quick and efficient. It's small and easy to hide. This makes it easy to pack for vacations and adventures, however, it also makes it easy to lose, which is why I'm purchasing another charger. Go figure.
The Airport Express is an amazing product. For a little more money than your standard wireless router, you get a lot more. First, it is important to point out that the Airport Express works whether you have a Mac, Windows based machine, or both. There is no compatibility concerns to worry about.First, wireless networking. The Airport Express does everything you could wish for, when it comes to creating a wireless network. It supports full WPA encryption, and it has all the settings and customization that you would expect, from such a product.Wireless printing. No matter what computer you're on, you don't have to worry about the computer that is connected to the printer being on and being plugged into the printer. You can print from your notebook computer in the living room to the printer connected to the airport express, via USB, in your office. Perfect!Air Tunes, stream music from iTunes to the output on the Airport Express. Connect the output to a stereo, or speakers. Enjoy the tunes.Size. The Airport Express is very small, for it fits in your hand. You can pack it in your suitcase, when you're at a hotel with high speed net, plug the hotel's ethernet into your airport express, and you have your wireless network in your hotel room!Overall, if some or all of these features interest you, pick up the Airport Express!
Length:: 1:00 MinsThis is a great set of general-purpose binoculars - great for people watching, bird watching in a park (probably not in the wild since the 7x zoom is powerful enough), even theater outings. The build is high quality and the binoculars feel really good in the hands. For the price charged here on Amazon.com, this is an excellent product at a great value.Now, can you see the birds in my video clip? The distance is about 20-25 yards. (Shot through the left lens, with my Fuji camera lens set to wide-angle.) I also show you the multi-lingual instructions sheet, the case, the binoculars, the box, and the eyepiece caps. Not shown is the wrist strap.
Maxell manufactures excellent Xlii high bias" 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. Record lectures, music, conversations, piano playing and more--whatever you want! The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.The tapes are extremely well made in that they DO allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.If you pay the current Amazon price of $13.77 for the five-pack you spend roughly $2.75 per tape. Some people will find that to be too expensive while others will want these blank cassette tapes anyway, not minding having to pay the price.Unfortunately, these tapes still cannot produce 100% the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be at least somewhat sharper and clearer with less background noise than these Maxell cassette tapes will give you. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording. I also agree with the gentleman who suggests that you clean the heads of the tape deck before using these cassette tapes to maximize the quality of the recording.Overall, Maxell Xlii high bias cassette tapes makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape."
(Note: The only difference between the e750 and e755 is that the latter e755 comes with a photo viewer software title on the companion CD. In fact, the machine in the e755 packaging says e750".)Featuring a new mobile processor, the most internal memory of any PDA (64MB RAM plus 64MB non-RAM for a total of 128MB), built-in 802.11b wi-fi, the best PDA screen from Toshiba so far. and good battery life, the e750/e755 is close to being perfect. The compact (0.6 inches thin) and attractive form factor is a huge plus, as well.The new Intel processor (PXA255 running at 400Mhz) is without doubt the star of the new line-up. It's an updated version of the first-gen Xscalar processor, which wasn't getting good reviews due to lack of optimization options. The e750/e755 *is* optimized for the new processor, which results in speedy application launches and operations. Nothing gives a Pocket PC user more pleasure than seeing his/her favorite app come up instantly. The e750 also allows you to switch between two speeds, hence you can choose between higher speed or better battery life. Even at the lower speed, PPC apps feel quick and responsive. The LiIon battery is user replaceable, and an optional "extended" battery is available now from Toshiba.What's left to improve for Toshiba is their lackluster customer support. Because their PPCs are made by an OEM in Taiwan rather than in their own plants in Japan, the build quality is still a bit lacking, but the e750/e755 seems to be better made than the e740, which was getting a lot of complaints.Update with more details:The e750 is indeed a joyful PDA! The high price and the lack of a built-in camera aside -- but who really needs the latter, right? -- it really comes close to being a master-of-all-trades device. I haven't tested the wireless features as much as I had hoped, due to the fact there just aren't many free hot spots around these days. But I'll update this review when I get more hands-on experience in this area.In terms of everyday use this is a true workhorse. I'll talk more about the specs below, but the numbers don't really reveal how pleasant using the e750 is. The hundreds of annoyances that plagued the e740, its older cousin, have been fixed. There are far fewer crashes and syncs go more smoothly. At just 6.5 ounces, while not the lightest Pocket PC, you get something very close to a handheld computer, especially when you get the foldable keyboard!The e750 has a total of 128MB of RAM, 32 of which is ROM, 32 is flash-ROM (which means content stored on it won't go away even if the battery is completely dead... think of it as a small hard disk without moving parts), and the rest 64 is true user-accessible RAM. Having a real 64MB to play with is a bliss, especially for someone like me who started out with 16MB on the Casio EM-500 and last saw 46MB on the HP iPaq 1910. The extra 18MB makes a big difference. Now I can play Doom and Quake at the same time!Given the thin form factor of the e750, it still amazes me how it can feature both a Type I/II CompactFlash (CF) slot as well as a Secure Digital (SD) slot. Since wi-fi is already built-in, both can happily be used solely for storage expansion. The highest capacity for SD right now (as of April 2003) is 512MB, but that costs a small fortune. The best value belongs to 256MB cards, and I highly recommend the one from Lexar (see my review there). If you put in a 512MB SD and a 512MB CF, you'll get 1GB of extra storage for under one-hundred-fifty dolrs! The CF slot can probably be used for other peripherals; but the situation is not clear right now as to which CF peripherals will be supported in the e750.The 3.8-inch (measured diagonally) screen is the largest among Pocket PCs on the market today, and the best from Toshiba so far. I personally like the screens on the iPaq 1910 and Viewsonic V35 better, but this screen is more than "good." The resolution is still PPC's standard 240x320, so it would be nice to see someday PPC manufacturers would go higher than that. I'd love a PPC the size of the e750 but with a 4" screen and 320x480 resolution!There are a lot of optional accessories you can get for the e750, including the foldable keyboard and extended battery mentioned above. This is truly an exciting newcomer to the PPC family... one that looks and performs like a winner."

Obviously if you want tons of bells & whistles you should check out more expensive camcorders from Sony and Canon and JVC. The Sharp is a very capable and adequate camcorder for 99.9% of us amateur videographers. The 3 LCD is beautiful. Some people complain about the shape, but I find using two hands to hold the camcorder (any camcorder) makes much steadier shots, so I actually have come to prefer the shape of Sharp's camcorders. In any event, it's really easy to use and the battery life is good, too. So if you are looking for an everyday camcorder, be sure to consider this great value."
Alright, it's the 21st century now. It's getting to the point where portable CD players are nice...but are so 20th century. I decided I needed a less-bulky and nicer portable audio device. Searching around Best Buy, I came across this. Let me tell you, the iPod is probably the most overrated portable electronics device ever.Okay, first off by reading the 1-star or 2-star amazon.com reviews, many of them are either unfair or haven't given it a chance/didn't read directions.Okay, I've heard A LOT about Napster software. For starters, which is a dissappointment, If you don't have Windows XP, go back to the search engine, because it's only compatable with XP. Macs don't count. Maybe, not guarrantee this, but maybe it will work on Windows ME. Not 100% sure, but all stores have a money-back guarantee...right? Also, it's not JUST compatable with Napster. Just because it says Napster on the box and player, does that mean ONLY Napster? No. It's also compatable with Windows Media Player 10, and I've also heard some people got it to work well with RealPlayer. Napster isn't the ONLY software compatable with this player.For features, it has way more features than the standard, or even photo iPod. First off, yes, it has a built-in digital camera. The pictures aren't crystal clear, but I have a digital camera to do this for me. The pictures are fair to good, but don't get this just for the camera.What you should get this for is for the wondeful MP3 player/organizer, radio, and MP3 recorder (both line-out and microphone). First off, the menus and organizing is unbelieveable. The menu has a few options, then those options have options, and so on. Example, if you click Music, you have artist, album, genre, song. Then, one you get into the organizer, if you click on a song, it will show up in Now Playing". It would be better if it had a button to go back to the main menu, but it's only a minor problem. The FM tuner was better than expected and actually better than most portable radios out there. The microphone was also a great feature, and recorded voice very clearly. There is also a line-out to hook up the player to a set of speakers. If you need a car adapter, a lot of electronics stores sell cassette adapters for only about $10. The line-out also lets you record to another audio device. (Example: You can connect the TV to the MP3 player and the player will record the TV.)The MP3 player holds around 5,000 songs on the MP3 format at around 192 kb/s. Personally, I use 128, so I have about a hundred extra. It depends on how much quality you want out of your tunes. If you want so-so sounding, you'll get more than 5,000, and if you want high quality, it will likely be less. And, it also supports WMA files, so then you'll have far more than 5,000 songs.The sound quality is excellent. The player features presets for the equalizer, similar to the one in WMP, without the distortation. It also features a 3D equalizer, which many companys (Samsung, Panasonic, RCA) have been doing with their audio products as well. The MP3 player will power most, and about all headphones.The LCD is in fact proven to be colored, and it is very sharp. It is 1.8 inches, which is equivalent or bigger to the size of an iPod screen. Some players like the Rio Karma have gigantic screens; though, the look is very unappealing. The player also allows you to view your own photos, or the album art. Or, you can look at the headphones, which to me gets hilarious after a few looks.The biggest dissappointment is battery life. Ten ohurs may seem long, but in reality, not really. Most MP3 players have around 15-20 hours of battery. Though, this isn't much of a gripe for the non-travelers.Also, the USB 2.0 was nice of Samsung; giving us the best cable link from the MP3 player to the computer.Overall, unless you don't have Windows XP, and aren't a serious traveler, the YH925GS kicks the iPod in the trash. Well, you would throw away an iPod, right?"
I don't want to repeat what others have said aplenty about the NX70V. I just want to provide a quick perspective from a casual user.My overall impression is it's a power user's toy, and I'm very pleased with the built-in VGA-resolution camera, which has fast refreshing speed and high image quality. Sony packs in tons of features on this model, which makes the interface a little too cluttered and too busy. Palm OS is meant to be a simple and elegant experience, but the NX70V is rather daunting especially to the first-time user. The number of features and functions is just overwhelming, obscuring the ease-of-use trumpeted by Palm. And once you start using all the multimedia features, kiss good-bye to battery life: you'd better carry the charger with you at all times.Would I want to own this nice PDA with everything but a built-in sink? Yes. But would I pay such a high price? Nope. I'm really happy with my [the brand I own], which has a better screen and a less stressful user interface and costs only half as much.

This is a very high quality cable. It has all the right materials, specifically high-performance polypropylene foam dielectric on the signal lines. The connectors are large and solidly molded.
HOSA is making a real name for themselves in terms of quality low cost well made cable assemblies. This is every bit a professional quality patch cord. I bought it because I recently purchased a pair of amplified speakers from M-audio which feature professional 1/4 TRS inputs (differential) to cut hum and noise from the signal.The HOSA input is the quietest of all 3 inputs on the speaker system by 6dB. It sounds great, works great, and didn't set me back a fortune.I own several HOSA TRS/XLR adapters and have never had a problem with them. I would not expect one with this cable set given its construction quality and strain relief on all ends. Don't let the low cost fool ya - there's a good cable set here. And to the commenter who complained it's mono - it is 2 x mono - on any mixing panel that is how stereo inputs are achieved - one signal per channel. HOSA also makes 1/8 to 1/4 STEREO single plug cable sets, but you must look at the picture and read the description to ensure it is exactly the gender and size you want. I know the fustration of having the wrong cable adapter, hence I keep my build your own kit handy when what's in the cable box doesn't do it."
A friend of mine has the PC160 and he's quite happy with it. Toner cartridge can be expensive, though, so if you make a lot of copies, you might as well go to a professional copy shop. But for the small business owner who occasionally makes copies, this is an affordable copier.You should be aware that the newer model PC170 is almost $50 cheaper on Amazon than this older model, so I suggest getting the PC170 instead.
This is identical to the regular" EOS Digital Rebel that has been out since 2003, but is coated in a more professional-looking black body. It's still all-plastic, though."
Here's a simple, inexpensive digital camera that you can carry all day and take low-res pictures and capture brief low-res videos. You don't have to worry about breaking anything. This Chinese-manufactured cute little thing is all plastic but quite solid. It also works very well as a webcam -- no surprise since Logitech has been building these for a long time.Would have been better if the battery life were a bit better and the resolution a bit higher. But then again, at this price, this is a no-brainer toy to own.
Even though I love my Sony NW-HD3 20GB MP3 player, when I listen to my beloved classical music collection, I still much prefer CDs, since when it comes to sound quality, MP3 simply cannot match the original CD recording. This Sony CD player is great for classical music (as well as jazz and vocals, or anything that an audiophile loves). You can feed the output to a high-end amplifier and get unbeatable sound. Or use a good pair of headphones.This CD/MP3 player is also great for books-on-CDs. Ripping CD audiobooks is a pain and a tedious process. So it's simply easier to listen to the CDs direcly, and this lightweight, stylish, easy-to-use CD player is just PERFECT for that. And it runs for days on a single AA battery. (Hint: get Panasonic's new Oxyride AA batteries for double the life of even the best alkalines.)I just love this portable CD player. If you are also an audiophile or an audiobook lover, this is perfect for your needs.The only minor gripe is the player doesn't support WMA, which would have been even more fantastic for ripped audiobooks (better quality, smaller files). MP3 still takes too much space at the usual 128kbps bitrate. If I were to rip, I'd want to rip into 48kbps WMA and would still get great sound quality. (But I don't have the patience to rip anyway...)BTW, this player (and the black version) are actually cheaper on Sony's consumer website, sonystyle dot com, where it sells for $49.95. I should have checked there first.UPDATE: I was happy to discover that the inline remote control that comes with the D-NE320 also works on my Sony NW-HD3 20GB MP3 player. Awesome!
I did not like the bobbing effect of the escort's included 1 dia suction cup mounting system, so opted for this heavy duty clip. Now for the pros/cons:PROs:1 - Your detector is rock solid stuck to the sun visor2 - visability of the detector display is enhanced3 - it looks alot more professional and out of the way.Cons:1 - you may no longer be able to pull down the visor because the radar detector (in my case) is in the way!2 - in my specific vehicle, there is some blockage of the rearward laser sensorOverall, its a keeper, but in retrospect I'd like a mount that bonds to the windshield much the same way the rearview mirror does."
I've trusted lowepro products for innovation for over a year now, and this is no different. I have but one complaint which is the small size. You can put some filters, credit cards, cash, or a spare battery in the zipper pouch but not much more. It comes with a strap and clip assembly to carry it over your shoulder as well as a belt loop (2) - I recently lost my wallet and mounted this on my belt instead with credit cards, cash, and a fast velcro flap on the front for my most used amazon credit card. In front of that is a zipper pocket that I find handy for slim batteries like small cameras would use.I could not find a camera sized to this package - its about the size of a credit card and it has now replaced my lost wallet for beld=t carry. The velcro flap makes it fast to pull out your number one credit card.If it were about 2x larger there would be alot of purposes for it. Keeping with the lowepro name it has pockets inside for sdhc cards. The zipper and stitching around it is top notch as to be expected with lowepro products."
Yep, this two-year-old model is heavy, bulky, and butt-ugly. But guess what? For under 150 bux, you are getting a capable 20GB MP3 player that also doubles as an external USB 2.0 hard drive on Windows systems! Plus you get a recorder. Only thing missing is an FM radio, but I never cared for that anyway. Really not bad at all. And it works pretty well. Of course, I still wish the French designers at Archos would do something about the styling on their products... After all, they are French.You should definitely check out the free, open source firmware replacement called Rockbox. The url is rockbox dot haxx do se and it's a free download that will make this so much more pleasant to use. E.g., it reduces background statics (wow!), lots of resume features, even gives you games.This Archos is a geek's dream, thanks to the good folks who develop Rockbox... and the fine folks at Archos.
Bought this machine six months ago and have been using it heavily. It works great. It even plays VCDs, which are cheap and popular here in Manhattan, esp. if you are into Asian (i.e., Hong Kong) films. The remote control is pretty user-friendly. I like this DVD player a lot.
In terms of picture quality the Sampo is pretty much on par with others in this size class. I've seen a few plasma TVs made by Fujisu at Harvey Electronics stores here in New York, and they are absolutely the best. Where Sampo &quot;excels&quot; is the price point. You get bright, fairly clear pictures and also HDTV readiness for a very attractive price, even better than the hot-selling ones at Gateway. BTW, Sampo makes the Gateway plasma TVs.The PME-42X6 stands out among 42&quot; plasma TVs in being HDTV-ready. This means it supports all the HDTV resolutions from 480p to 720p to 1080i. (BTW, BestBuy.com has a decent guide to HDTV terminology.) It doesn't have a built-in tuner, though, so you'll need to get one yourself, so add a couple hundred to your budget. As with other plasma TVs you should hire a professional to tune and set up the Sampo. Improper setups can cause the gas bulbs inside the TV to burn out faster.As I've already said image quality is average, which means you'll see some blocky artifacts. Of all the plasma TVs I've viewed extensively, only Fujisu and Panasonic models seem to be free from such artifacts. (No, I don't work for either company or Sampo!) Sony and Philips are acceptable, too. The other Asian TVs all suffer from this as well as problems with getting the black &quot;color&quot; right properly. In terms of everyday use you probably won't mind such &quot;defects,&quot; since they are not too obvious in a good DVD movie. Sampo does seem to have better color-decoding technology than others in this price class which means you get red and blue right, etc.Before I finish up let me give you an update: I just found out via cnet.com that the native resolution of this unit is 1024x1024. This means 720p and 1080i will be simulated rather than in native. To tell the truth at least on this Sampo it doens't mean much. Everyone would prefer native support for every HDTV resolution, but even super-expensive units from Zenith and Hitachi don't have this feature. The Sampo is totally affordable and deserves a recommendation.
PC Mag ranked this 37 LCD TV an "editor's choice." Their profesional reviewers liked the excellent image quality, the solid build, the styling, the generous number of inputs, and the ease of use. They also gave it 5 stars.I've spent way too many hours staring at this screen at my local Best Buy, where it's selling for $1000 more than here on Amazon. The 37" size just looks so much BIGGER than my 30" LCD at home. When you watch sports on ESPN, you can see not only the sweat beads, but the reflections in the beads. The 37" size is best when you are 8-10 feet away from the screen. I highly recommend getting an HDI-capable DVD player, too, if you watch a lot of DVDs. (Recommended: Denon DVD-1910 for $250.) The Denon can significantly improve DVD image quality when you use the all-digital DVI connection between the the DVD player and the screen.Sharp's Aquos line represents the best in LCD TV technology and the company's coming out with better panels as well as larger panels -- a 63" just came out in Japan. Their jaw-dropping image quality and styling make you the envy of your block (unless you live on Sunset Blvd. or next to Bill Gates)."
The iPod Shuffle was announced and made available, in January 2005.I received my iPod Shuffle, about five weeks, afters its introduction, so I have been using it, for over seven months. I should point out that I already had a full size iPod, but I wanted the shuffle, for its small size and extreme portability.The shuffle is incredibly impressive, when you first receive it. Its tiny size and light weight really strikes you as unbelievable.The shuffle charges and syncs to your iTunes library by USB 2.0. Charging takes about three hours, if you want a full charge, and the syncing of songs is pretty fast. You can have the shuffle select the songs randomly from your iTunes library, or choose your own custom mix.I find the lack of display on the shuffle to not be an issue. The reason being is that this shuffle holds about 240 songs, so there really isn't a need, for a display. After all, who wants to be looking at a tiny display? I just want to listen to my music. You can have the shuffle play your songs in the order you setup in iTunes, or have it mix things up, with a random shuffle.The shuffle has been reliable over the past six months. It still works great, looks great, and the battery still lasts close to the specification 12 hours.Overall, I still use my full size iPod, for the majority of the time. However, when I want extreme portability and something that is not weighing down my pocket, I use the shuffle. It is also nice to use, if you're going to be an environment where you're concerned about damage or theft to your iPod, since the shuffle is less expensive. The iPod Shuffle makes a great second iPod, for iPod fans. However, it makes a great first and only iPod, for many people too. The iPod Shuffle brings the convenience of having any song (up to approximately 240 on this model), from your iTunes music library with you, wherever you go. Music makes life a lot of fun, and this shuffle helps bring the music to you.
This Walkman by Sony offers serious music lovers the opportunity to listen to MP3 files stored on a CD-R, a regular CD (of course), a CD-RW and there's a digital AM and FM radio tuner! This Walkman uses two AA batteries and you get lots of play time out of the batteries if you pick good batteries. It weighs less than eight ounces--great!At first glance the controls on the Walkman itself appear slightly confusing but after about five minutes tops you learn all the important and most commonly used functions. The controls also make it easy to do basic things such as adjusting the sound, starting a CD and stopping it. The instruction manual is fairly clear and if you have questions you can always contact Sony customer support by phone or Internet.However, I noticed some disappointments. Sony advertises this Walkman as being for any music lover--and they are right. However, the controls are rather small so you need to be careful of how you touch them with your fingers. Finally, the ear buds hurt my ears almost from the very start of listening to a CD on this Walkman. I strongly suggest you purchase a better quality headset or earphones that will be more comfortable.Overall, music enthusiasts will be thrilled with this Walkman. The features impress me and I believe you will be impressed, too. The quality of the sound is excellent; and it can handle quite a few presets for different radio stations. What's more, there's even a two-position Automatic Volume Limiter System to make the volume just right (and sometimes a bit lower) so you can hear everything very clearly.I recommend this portable CD player for music lovers everywhere.
This inexpensive portable CD player from Panasonic combines an excellent basic CD discman with MP3 capabilities. You can play regular CD's and CD-R or CD-RW discs burned with audio CD content (i.e., CD-DA" Compact Disc Digital Audio format), just like any CD player. When playing CD's it has two anti-skip modes, one 10-second and the other 45-second. The single sheet of user's guide says the 10-second memory mode gives better sound quality. There are two EQ settings in addition to the plain "none" level: XBS and "Live". As you would expect, as a CD discman the SL-MP70 delights with its light weight and good looks.But you can also play MP3 files burned onto CD-R or CD-RW discs. You can burn MP3 files to CD-R/RW discs in two ways: use a program like Windows Media Player or iTunes to convert MP3 back to CD-DA, and burn the disc as an audio CD. Then what you get is exactly a regular audio CD. Or, to save time and effort -- and remember that since MP3 is a lossy format, converting an MP3 file back to CD-DA does not improve the audio quality, i.e., "garbage in, garbage out" -- you can simply drag and drop the MP3 files to a CD-R or CD-RW disc and burn them. When viewed in Windows, the CD-R/RW looks like a regular folder with the MP3 files. Then you can play these files on the SL-MP70. The player recognizes the files gracefully. (The slightly more expensive SL-MP80 model can also play WMA files -- that's Windows Media Audio format, developed by Microsoft.)Unlike another, cheaper Panasonic discman, this one can display MP3 tags, basically information embedded in each MP3 file that has the track name, album name, artist name, etc. The SL-MP70 displays the track name and album name if they are available. If you download music in the MP3 format, chances are the guy who ripped it already put in the tags, also known as "ID3." If not, you can use a program like Music Match to edit the tags yourself.Note that, if you buy music Apple iTunes-style from sites like Walmart and Music Match, they only sell the music in the WMA format, not MP3, so you'd need the SL-MP80 player to play them.Some other observations:Good - the player remembers the last track or MP3 file you played, so when you turn it back on, it resumes from the point it left off. I don't think you can turn this off with this model.Puzzling - you cannot fast search within an MP3 track, although you can do so within an audio CD track. This is not a problem unless you are like me and carry audio books encoded in MP3. These books tend to have chapters that last more than 15 minutes. Luckily for me, my commute is 1 hour each way, so I have no problem with this. Also, most music MP3 tracks are no more than 4 minutes, so this shouldn't be a major problem.Good - Long battery life. I run this off 2 AA NiMH batteries (1800 mAh each) and I've run on the same set for over 20 hours of play and I still see three full bars on the battery indicator. And yes, the battery indicator has three bars and goes to none when the batteries are near exhaustion. This is really energy efficient, and is one thing that sets this apart from the cheaper/lesser-brand products from Classic, Samsung, Memorex, iriver, etc.Could be better - more volume for those nearly hearing-impaired thanks to their 24x7 listening on earphones habit, easier to get to the last of 1000 MP3 files (as if you'd do that often), backlighting (but that'd surely raise the price), remote control (ditto). Really, for this price, I think we are already getting a lot of bang for the buck, and the build quality of Panasonic players is just top-notch. And no, I don't work for Panasonic or any of its agents or distributors, and nobody in my family or circle of friends does, either!Tip - to get around the "press forward 99 times to get to the 100th song or 999 times to get to the 1000th song" problem, put a dozen songs in each folder. The Panasonic automatically designates each folder an album, and you can skip to the next album by holding down the fast-forward button.In summary, the SL-MP70 is a stylish and very dependable CD/MP3 player. Highly recommended for those who don't need a separate MP3 player like iPod or RCA Lyra."
I just bought this mouse without thinking at Wal-Mart, because my old mouse's cord snapped (long story, it was the crappy one that came w/my PC). I wanted one with a laser insteado f a trackball because trackballs just don't seem accurate, and are really jumpy to me. So, I spent $25 for the Logitech Click! Mouse.First impression, I hate the software. What?!?! Musicmatch? eBay? RealArcade? Huh? Well, anyway, I really don't even think I needed the software, all it has is Windows-based functions you can easily do in the Control Panel. Just skip the software, as it plugged and played anyway.Second impression, this mouse feels comfortable. On the left and right side, there are places to rest your fingers. Very comfy, although at times they slip on to the mouse pad. Argh!Right button, left button, scroll button, the basics. But looking at the picture, your probably wondering (What's that square button thinge?) It's a really cool feature, that will allow you to go on any window on your computer. Neat, but there's a quirk I really hate about it (Note: This was mentioned in another review.). While pressing the button, it oddly moves the pointer to a different place on the screen (approx. 2 inches away from it's place). Bull$h!t!The movement of the mouse is great, well it's an optical mouse. It's 100% accurate.There's a few major quirks that may want to change your mind, however if you can live past the adware software, the finger slip, and the movement of mouse during the click function, you'll be a fan of this mouse.
NOTE: At present (Oct. 2004) the LC-30HV6U LCD TV should cost under $2500. Amazon was selling it for $2300 but now there seems to be a pricing error. I have notified Amazon.Review:The Sharp Aquos LC-30HV6U 30 LCD TV is an outstanding LCD TV. Like the other widescreen LCD TVs from Sharp, it represents the state-of-the-art in LCD television today.Compared to the more popular (and more affordable at $400 less) LC-30HV4U model -- who the heck was the genius that came up with these silly model designations? -- the present 30HV6U model sports better technology. But for the most part, I feel the cheaper 30HV4U is a better bang for the buck, unless you absolutely want the best, in which case the extra $400 for this 30HV6U is well worth it.- Better contrast ratio. 30HV6U's is 700 vs. 4U's 500.- Faster response time. 6U is about 16ms realized vs. 4U's 25ms.- 1-bit digital audio amplifier, which is absent in the 4U model. This technology recalls Kenwood's successful 1-bit DAC that revolutionized how CD music was processed a decade ago.- Better speakers. Regardless, you should get your own hi-fi.- Speakers are placed beneath the LCD panel, vs. the 4U's side-placed speakers, which I find more stylish and convenient. Both models' speakers can be detached.Both models are HDTV-ready (native 720p), have DVI, and can be used as a PC or Mac monitor.In short, the 6U model has a (slightly) better LCD panel. I say "slightly" because in real-world performance terms, the 4U is already very outstanding. If one had to rank LCD TVs on the market today, in each size segment, the 6U models are definitely #1, with the 4U coming in at a very close second. (Of course, if you work for another LCD TV maker, you may disagree. But me, Gadgester, is an everyday consumer and a relatively unbiased observer and follower of technology.)Hope this quick review helps you somewhat. E-mail me with questions and I'll try to answer them."
The SL-SV550 from Panasonic is a stylish, lightweight CD player that also works well with MP3 audio files and has a nice built-in radio with both AM and FM bands. This model is not the sporty, rugged type Panasonic also sells, but nonetheless exhibits the highest build quality. (Made in Japan.)Pros:- Incredibly long battery life on two AA batteries. Takes both alkaline (1.5Vx2) and NiMH (1.2Vx2) types of batteries. The battery indicator has four levels: 1-3 bars, plus no bar to indicate low battery. I've played a mixture of audio CDs, MP3 CD-Rs and radio for over a week on two fresh AA alkalines from Walgreen's, and there are still 1-2 bars left. Just incredible. The use of standard AA batteries also means to need to buy expensive proprietary batteries or carry a charger. NOTE: if you use NiMH batteries, due to their low initial voltage, the indicator may exhibit only 1-2 bars from the start, but the NiMH batteries will actually last longer. This is speaking from my experience with other Panasonic CD/MP3 players (e.g., SX70/80).- Very clean sound. The bundled headphones are ok, but I use a set of noise-cancelling earbuds, and the sound from the Panasonic is very clean and pleasant. The bass, even when boosted, is not too strong, but that's fine with me as excessive bass gives me headaches. There's plenty of volume from the radio and audio CD plays, but MP3 audio can be a bit too soft, so you may want to get a pair of volume-control headphones.- Compatible with audio CDs, CD-R and CD-RW burned with audio CD tracks, CD-R and CD-RW burned with MP3 or WAV files. I've tried a good many number of MP3-filled CD-R discs, some even scratched, and the Panasonic has no trouble with any of them. Some notes here: 1. When creating an MP3 CD be sure to put files in different root-level folders, with no more than 12 in each folder. The Panasonic strives for simplest controls, at the expense of extensive file navigation. The use of folders simplifies skipping to the album (folder) and track (file) you want. The player does remember the last track/file played, unless you change discs. 2. This player does not display ID3 tags, only track number and elapsed time. This is more a CD player that can support MP3 files, rather than a dedicated MP3 player. For the latter, you might as well go for an iPod, Rio or RCA Lyra.- Great radio functions. Very good reception, better than my dedicated portable radio, and deafeningly loud at the max volume. Twenty FM presets and ten AM presets. Very easy to program.- Anti-skip that works flawlessly. You shouldn't drop this unit, though, as it's not designed to be dropped.- Stylish and lightweight. Only 6 ounces with two AA batteries.Minor cons:- Cannot search within an MP3 track. You can search within audio CD tracks, but not within MP3. No big deal for music, but inconvenient for MP3 audio books.- Small buttons. Buttons are responsive but not laid out logically, and they are all too small. A few times I pressed the skip button instead of volume control which I meant to.- Battery compartment is under the CD. My old Panasonic discmen had external battery compartments, but the newer models all put them under the CD, inside. If the door is not closed in place it can pop up and scratch your CD. The engineer who made this switch should be shot. Also, when will Panasonic start using AAA batteries to make these even slimmer?In summary, a great portable CD/MP3 player for the buck. Highly recommended (unless you plan to listen to a lot of MP3s).
About iPods: They change your life. Simple as that. The ability to carry 1,000 songs in your pocket (or a bunch of audiobooks, one of the many free Podcasts of news, commentary or music 'radio,' and your contacts) is still revolutionary.In addition to the iPods, which are clearly best-of-breed devices (in part because they maintain their simplicity instead of adding buggy feature bloat found in competitors), iTunes and the iTunes music store have run rings around its competitors. That's why iPods have 76% market share -- and rising.About the new mini:It gives you iPod-level functionality in a 3.6 oz. masterpiece of engineering, with newly improved 18-hour battery life to boot. Colors add flash and style that make competitors look oh-so-80s.The wheel and click input takes a few minutes to master and is far more intuitive than anything else on the market -- which are fully of clunky buttons.Another reason to buy an iPod over a competitor: Add-ons. There are literally thousands of products out there for customizing your iPod.Finally, if you are getting this as a gift for someone else, for heaven's sake, don't go for a 'bargain' player. Especially if this is for someone new to digital music. A big part of Apple's genius is its ability to make its software easy to use for all -- heck, even The Queen has an iPod Mini! If she can use one, so can your mom, your grandmother and your kids. Those same people are likely to look at a Rio like it's an alien from another planet, and when they are forced to use that confusing Windows media software, well, that gadget is going to end up on a shelf gathering dust...Enjoy!
These units are in the original condition the day these were first purchased. They have been tested and working out of the box, just plug and play. Drivers were loaded and modem and network drivers loaded!
This leather cases are hand-stitched to create the perfect fit for my iPod Classic 80GB. There is a space on the base of the case for the dock connector. So, I don't have to remove the case to get my iPod charged and allows easy access to my headphone jack. And this pure leather case incorporates a flip frame that is hand-mounted wit full screen protector. I like this case very much while the case was arrived little bit later than the expected date. I also appreciate Eforcity providing a prompt reply when I asked for the shipping status of my order,
The iP2000 from Canon is a capable photo printer for occasional use. It boasts high speed and excellent photo quality. In the end I paid $20 more and got the iP3000 instead because (according to my Staples sales guy) the iP3000 allows individual color tanks, so when you run out of one ink you don't need to replace all the colors.Of course, in reality the colors tend to run out more or less at the same time.
Maxell manufactures excellent 60 minute XL2" cassette tapes for very good quality tape recordings of music as well as, of course, all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 60 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 30 blank minutes for recording on each side. The tape playback will work well in just about any tape deck including the one in your car.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell "XL2" cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would remain sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. It's just not quite as good as a digitized CD-R recording. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.Overall, Maxell makes the XL2 cassette tape to give us a great choice when we want reliable cassette tapes to record music at a high level of quality for a cassette tape. This cassette tape can be used to record other things, too, including lectures at school. I have used this brand for a while now and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell XL2 60 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape--especially music."
The Optio S, the smallest digital camera that's not a toy, makes a perfect gift this holiday season. Words cannot describe how small and compact it is -- especially if you don't even know what a mint tin looks like! Chances are, you've seen people carry this small wonder, perhaps at the World Trade Center memorial site or Central Park or David Letterman show. It's one of the things that prompt you to ask, Wow, what is *that*!" Well, it packs 3 megapixels and 3X optical zoom, and come with all the amenities you find in a modern digital camera, such as a real-time LCD viewfinder and a bunch of settings that, alas, require frequent trips to the user's guide. But, you'll take comfort in the fact that Optio S's basic functions are really easy to master. It's what the Asians affectionately refer to as a "moron's camera", so easy to use anyone can pick up and shoot right away.There's some controversy regarding the picture quality out of Optio S. I recommend you experiment with it and find the best combination of settings for you. (This suggestion applies to all cameras anyway.) And be sure to get an extra memory card and set the picture resolution and image quality settings to maximum.... I highly recommend the dimunitive yet powerful Optio S. Another model I also love is the Minolta Dimage Xt, which is a little more expensive but has the advantage of a periscope zoom lens. Now how cool is *that*?"
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media 64MB CompactFlash Digital Film Jewel Case, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
The new DiMage X is just an incredible camera! First of all it's small, perhaps the smallest 2-megapixel digicam on the American market today. I still have my Canon S100 but this one is not only thinner but also lighter -- and the battery life is longer, too!The second most amazing thing is even though the camera lens does not move, it *is* capable of 3X true *optical* zoom!! This is accomplished through an internal movable prism. Simply an ingenious piece of work! This means two things: fast zoom, and less distortion.The camera is quite fast in saving images (max resolution is 1600x1200, just like the Canon S100) to the SD card. It takes about 1-1.5 seconds between pictures when flash is used and around 1 sec when flash is off.Picture quality is *excellent*! One gripe I have about the S100 is the image quality is so so, especially in low-light conditions. The DiMage X easily ranks among the high-quality digital pictures. Images are sharp and color-rich. You can also make exposure compensation if you feel the picture is slightly over or under exposed.This is one awesome camera! Its unique shape, extraordinary compactness and awesome picture quality make it simply the best consumer digital camera.
This budget LCD monitor is a good choice for home and SOHO users. It's stylish in black, and the LCD panel gives good image clarity and color reproduction. Minor gripes I have are first the contrast ratio could be higher (but that can be said of every LCD I've seen) and second the menu system is harder than it should be. But this ranks top in departments that matter the most in a monitor: image quality. Also, I've had various NEC's in the past and their durability is nothing short of top-notch.
I bought these earbuds for my CD player (at the time) because the ones I had before died on the right side. They were a pair of RCA behind the neck headphones I bought at Family Dollar for very cheap. I would buy another pair but now I have an iPod and want to buy mostly earbuds and clip headphones that are more portable. I was planning on buying a pair of Philips earbuds at Target because (I thought) these were dead on the right side and I dislike the iPod earbuds, but when I plugged these into my iPod they worked fine. After a break-in session they sound even better.Well, they are only ten bucks, so what can you expect? Not a ton, not a surround soundstage and great, powerful sound, but maybe something that has at least average sound, are comfortable, and will last a decent amount of time. And thatt's mostly what I got with these earbuds.They don't have stellar sound (that for some reason a ton of reviews rave about), but they have decent sound that's good enough for the money. Not a lot of bass, but some pairs at this price have barely any bass. The mids on this pair are emphazised (but not by a lot, props to Sony). And they do have a good, clean sound to them, so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper end.For other aspects of the earbuds, they are very comfortable and fit much better than the Apple earbuds, but feel better with the pads. I have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time. Also, these are some durable headphones so far, and after a half-year of use they still put up nicely.Overall, not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables. Already got a better pair? Keep these for some useful back-ups. They don't have amazing sound, but are comfortable and last long enough to make them worth the price. 4 stars.NOTE: These are the case-less version of the MDRE828LP earbuds. If you want a case for a barely steeper price, check out the MDRE828LP earbuds instead of these, but if you want a money-saver, buy these.

This isn't a hands-on review as are my other Amazon.com reviews. The X50 hasn't been released yet as of today (9/18/04), but I just wanted to call your attention to a review in the Wall Street Journal written by Mossberg. He compared four upcoming super-compact cameras and found this to have the best picture quality (although the least style). I have owned half a dozen Minolta digital cameras and I think this will be another winner. As I recently lost my job I guess I won't be buying anything for a while. :( But be sure to check out the WSJ review from 9/15/2004, page D1.(Konica and Minolta used to be two separate companies but they merged recently to form Konica-Minolta.)
Now, if you use a Mac, you should probably just switch to Windows since this (and millions of other great products) won't play well with Apple's closed-architecture. (Maybe their upcoming switch to Intel will help, but then, maybe not.)Windows users, rejoice. This pure plug-and-play portable external hard drive from Western Digital is very easy to install and use. In fact you don't install anything: just plug into a USB 2.0 (or USB 1.1) port and go. Like most drives, this is best at writing and reading large files, so don't get frustrated if you find the speed lacking when you transfer a large batch of small files (e.g., millions of small JPEG or MP3 files).This compact, palm-sized drive is stylish. It's also quiet in operation. I like its look and feel better than its competition from Seagate (although I *am* a huge fan of Seagate's desktop hard drives). Ignore the Mac-using naysayers on this forum: if you have a PC, you will do fine. (My friend told me this worked with Linux on a PC, too, but I have not verified his claim since I don't use Linux.)Makes a great gift for that special santee, too. :)
The iPod first appeared four years ago, and the features continue to grow, with each update.I have owned the iPod with video playback, for several days now, and I continue to be impressed. Its physical appearance, quality, craftsmanship, and the wide array of features are keeping me entertained!The iPod with video playback was introduced on October 13, 2005. However, one should not necessarily consider this player a video player, but a great iPod music player, with video capabilities as a fantastic bonus. Nevertheless, the iPod with video playback is the most capable and feature-rich iPod ever produced by Apple.Video Playback - The iPod plays back H264 and MPEG4 encoded video. The iPod's new display is larger than ever at 2.5 inches, giving it a resolution of 320x240. What video content can you play on your iPod? This area is limited, at least currently. You can buy music videos on iTunes at $1.99 per song, which will play beautifully on the iPod. Furthermore, Apple has made available select television shows, for download on iTunes. They cost $1.99 per episode, for titles including ABC's hits Lost and Desperate Housewives. You can also watch the episodes you purchase on your computer. If you want to put some of your own video, onto your iPod, you will need to use an application such as QuickTime Pro to convert the video to the specific requirements to play on the iPod. You can also find video podcasts, which will play on the new iPod. Even if you do not plan to view video on the new iPod, its primary purpose is to be used as the world's best music player. You can still benefit from the beautiful new display, for it will help you find your favorite music faster, and you can view the album art that accompanies your music. I find myself looking forward to watching videos and video podcasts, on my new iPod!Size of new iPod - Does the picture of the new iPod make it appear larger to you? Well, it did to me. The iPod looked wider, in the photos I saw. However, it is not. The height and width of the iPod are identical to the previous generation iPod with click wheel. The only change in dimensions is the depth. The new iPod is actually thinner than what came before it! Yes, this 30 gig iPod is thinner than the previous 20 gig photo model by 30 percent. What does all this mean? The iPod continues get smaller, making it even easier to carry.Capacity - This 30 gig iPod has room, for a lot of entertainment. With storage, for up to 7,500 songs, 12,000 photos, or 75 hours of video. The great thing I love about my iPod is that my music, photos, and video only take up about 15 gigabytes. However, I use the additional space to backup data, from my computer. This is incredibly helpful, and could be a real saver, if something happened to your computer. See, the iPod functions as an external hard drive, so you can backup all sorts of data. The 60 gig version is available, for $100 more, so if you want to use it for lots of video, or you have an enormous music collection, you may want to consider that larger version, which also sports longer battery life.New Software Features - Apple has added features, to the new iPod besides video support. First, they have a clock feature, which quickly allows you to view the time, in up to four different time zones simultaneously. Furthermore, there is a stop watch, and a screen lock, which you can enable to keep people from snooping on your calendar and/or contacts.Battery - The battery life is one of the most important specifications that you, as an iPod user, are going to care about. This 30 gigabyte iPod sports a battery that will last up to 14 hours, when playing only music. Also note that repeatedly changing songs manually, and turning on the backlight will use up your battery considerably faster. Furthermore, the iPod's battery lasts a maximum of two hours, when playing back video. This version of the iPod no longer includes an adapter to charge the iPod, at an electrical outlet. You will have to buy that adapter separately, or always charge the iPod via USB 2.0. The charging works fine, from your computer's USB 2.0, but if you're traveling you might want the ability to charge, with the adapter. Also note that the iPod no longer supports syncing via firewire cable. You will have to use USB 2.0.Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. The iPod syncs your contacts, video, and music via the iTunes software.Podcasting - The iPod continues to support podcasting. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, for this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box. There are also video podcasts, so with the new iPod, you will be able to watch video podcasts, on the iPod's display.Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. The new iPod is available in a black or white finish. The black color is quickly becoming the most popular, but the white iPod is still the signature color. Do note that the black may show fingerprints and scratches more than the white iPod, much as a black car shows these blemishes more than a lighter colored car.Audiobooks - I'm always using my iPod, to listen to audiobooks. You can store literally hundreds of audiobooks on here that you buy from iTunes, or Audible. The iPod even has a feature that can slow down or speed up the reading of the audiobook, so that you hear it at just the right pace.Output - The iPod connects to your PC or Mac via the dock connector at the bottom of the unit. You will connect the included cable, to the computer via a USB 2.0 port. Furthermore, accessories are being made that will also connect to the bottom dock port, and you may purchase Apple's Universal iPod dock, for easy syncing to your computer. The dock (available separately) also includes s-video output, so you can show off slideshows and video, on a television. There are also iPod A/V cables available that allow composite video and audio output, for connecting your iPod to your television. This might interest you, not only to display slideshows on a television, but also to display TV shows or music videos on a television, which you purchased from iTunes.Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Enjoy your iPod experience.
I actually have the 8&quot; version, but played with a demo unit of the IDM-1731 (with 7&quot; LCD measured diagonally) at the Circuit City store in Union Square, Manhattan. I had just purchased a &quot;Bedazzled&quot; DVD at the store, and was able to try it out on this little machine. (Yes, many CC stores let you load your own DVDs to play on their demo DVD players.)As with my 8&quot; player, this model delivers good picture quality. It plays pretty much all kinds of video disc formats out there: DVD, VCD, SuperVCD, etc., as well as CD and CD-R with MP3 files. WMA files are supported as well. My 8&quot; player, which I use on the bus a lot, is surprisingly resistent to road bumps: I've never experienced a frame drop due to bumps or even when I move the player around, so I expect the 1731 model will be the same.The verdict on quality is rather mixed. Overall this is far less refined than portable DVD players from Panasonic. The paint on my player, for example, is already coming off after less than a year. The buttons on the player are not very responding, so you'll have to press hard or even press twice to make them work. The remote is ok. Not very user-friendly but totally functional. On the other hand, I've used my Initial a lot and done countless pauses and stops and restarts, and it's still quiet and working flawlessly.In summary, Initial DVD players belong to the value category. If I had some extra cash I'd opt for a Panasonic model for better picture quality, much better sound (both from speakers and earphones), and infinitely better quality and reliability. But, the Initial's are inexpensive and the one I have has not let me down at all.
Reviewer atomicwasteland" gives a detailed and accurate description of the input selections of this high-quality HDTV-compatible system selector/switcher. Given how many devices we gadget freaks own these days, this is a must-have device.I just wanted to mention that if you want to save money and don't need all that S-video stuff -- I myself already have a separate A/V home-theater system that accommodates multiple S-video inputs -- you can get the Mad Catz HDTV System Selector with 4 component video inputs for less than $30. Best Buy and Mad Catz's online store carry it."
The other reviewers have said it all. This is truly the best digital music device on the market. I just want to add that the 340 hours rating refers to MP3 encoded at 128Khz. If you do WMA at 64Khz, which gives roughly the same quality of music, you can go up to 700 hours! That's over 560 full-capacity audio CDs!Like the first reviewer I wish there were an IEEE-1394 connection for faster music transfer. Another thing that you have to be careful about is not to drop this thing. It doesn't skip when you jog, but I'm still not sure whether the hard drive will crash if you shake it too much, so do be careful.Other than these very minor gripes, get this for this holiday season. Simply the best!
This adapter works ok. Make sure it works with your TV's color space first! Other than that, a decent product.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The LEXAR 128MB MEMORY STICK, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
TDK manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape make it good for recording lectures and music using standard, less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback sound will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.In addition, the tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a TDK cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a TDK cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. TDK does manufacture higher quality cassette tapes including the SA; and these are very good tapes for recording music. Nevertheless, they still aren't the same as a digitized recording on CD-R or CD-RW. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape
Simple and easy to use, I wish I had bought one sooner. Save the batteries in your camera and use this Simpletech Reader. Just plug the Compact Flash Card into the Reader and then plug the Reader into the USB port on your PC. With Windows 2000/XP that's ALL you need to do, when finished downloading the pictures just pull out the Reader and remove the Compact Flash Card. I highly recommend this product, I think it's great.
This unit is GREAT! Oxford chipset for Mac users. Fast transfer through Firewire, runs cool fan is nice feature!
Ever since Apple introduced the Power Mac G5, in 2003, it has been the top dog, when it comes to Macs. Every Mac fan, geek, or professional wants one. With the October 2005 update to the Power Mac G5, Apple has made its professional desktop more powerful than ever.Right out of the box one is shocked and impressed, by the Power Mac G5. Its beautiful aluminium enclosure is a work of art, and it strikes all who see it.Processor - The power, in this Powermac, comes from its dual-core 2.3GHZ Power PC G5 processor. This is the latest technology, from IBM. This single dual-core chip provides significant speed increase over the previous dual processor model. The processor features a 1.15GHZ front side bus. This is a trend that will continue. More and more computers are going to sport dual-core processors, and you can enjoy it in your Power Mac now.Just how fast is this dual-core 2.3 GHZ G5 Power Mac? Some benchmarks are showing that it is faster than the previous 2.5 GHZ dual processor Power Mac. That shows you the power of the single dual-core chip, in this machine.Memory - This Power Mac G5 comes with 512 MB of memory. 512 MB of memory might be sufficient, for someone checking their email and browsing the web. However, obviously, buyers of the Power Mac are going to be power users, or at least multitask extensively. For that reason, the included 512 MB of memory is truly not sufficient. However, what's the great thing? This Power Mac supports up to a whopping 16 gigabytes of memory. Once you have your machine, simply pick up an affordable upgrade, from one of the trusted memory suppliers out there.Hard drive and optical drive - This Power Mac's hard drive is 250 GB. This gives you a tremendous amount of storage right out of the box. Nevertheless, if you find yourself needing more space you can add a second hard drive to your system. The included optical drive is a 16x Superdrive, with double-layer burning support. What more do you need? Burn up to 8.5 GB of data, on a double-layer disk. Fantastic.Video Card - Apple is often given a hard time about providing what some consider less than the very top, when it comes to video cards. The card in this Mac is a NVIDIA GeForce 6600 with 256MB of GDDR SDRAM, one single-link DVI port, and one dual-link DVI port. This Power Mac provides significant features over the standard graphic card, in the previous mid-range Power Mac. For example, you'll be able to connect an Apple 30-inch cinema display, plus you could connect a 20 or 23 inch cinema display next to that.Ports - You'll have the standard ports you'd expect on a Power Mac. Firewire 800, 2 Firewire 400, 4 USB 2.0, and 2 USB 1.1 on keyboard. When it comes to networking, Apple has provided 2 gigabit ethernet ports, so they really have you covered there. A Mighty Mouse and Apple Pro Keybaord are included in the box, both of which have a good feel to them.Mac OS X - If you're considering Macintosh for the first time, you're going to love the Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger. It is incredibly user friendly, and you'll quickly find the interface and design is saving you time. Furthermore, Mac OS X is much more secure than Windows, so you can put your mind at rest.iLife - Although many power and professional users of a Power Mac are going to be using his or her Mac, for a lot of professional work, with professional applications, Apple still includes iLife with every Mac. iLife can still be a great way to manage your personal digital life. Store and manage your digital images in iPhoto, jam to music in iTunes, create music in Garageband, and simple movies in iMovie.Furthermore, there are convenient applications built right into the operating system such as Dashboard, iCal (a great calendar that syncs up with your external devices including iPod), Dictionary, Expose, Stickies, DVD Player, and more.Value - This is the mid-range Power Mac, and it has some additional features over the five hundred less low-end model. Faster processor, larger hard drive,and more video memory. It also saves a substantial amount of the eight hundred dollar more Quad system. Overall, its best that you simply look at what you get, in each model and decide, which you need, for your needs. All three models are very capable machine, and this mid-range model offers a lot, for the price.Overall, the newest Power Mac G5 is another phenomenal product, from Apple. You'll be impressed many times, when you use this Power Mac. You'll be impressed when you pull its stunning aluminum case out of the box, when you use it for the first time and witness its speed, and everyday as you come to appreciate the convenience and joy of owning a powerful machine like the Power Mac G5. Apple has improved upon the Power Mac in several areas, and quite simply, they give you more value, for your dollar. Enjoy the Power Mac.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media CANADA ONLY 512MB SD CARD, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this 512MB card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
The Palm 500 is for the folks who want the svelte shape and rechargeable battery of the Palm V but also a convenient expansion slot for stuff like memory and modems. The lithium-polymer battery has also been somewhat improved.And since the Palm V is such a well-thought-out device, that ain't a bad place to start. However, Palm's price points seem overextended on the high end just about now, and their low-end devices, the M100, 105 and 125 -- skimp on screen size and thus cannot compete with low-end competitors from Handspring.As far as the &quot;color&quot; 505 is concerned, you might want to save your money. At least check it out in a store or look at a friend's. The folks at Palm skimped again on the screen, which they should not have done for their highest end device. I could understand colors this washed out on a cheapie color Palm, but not on a model that has to compete with the brilliant screen on the Compaq iPaq.All in all, however, these are evolutionary devices and I see no real need for existing Palm users to spend the money to upgrade, unless you absolutely positively can not do without some expansion add-on...
I am very very pleased with this product.The price was right and the shipping speedy. I would abosolutely make a future purchase!!!
Apollo P-2250 PrinterThe Apollo P-2250 color inkjet printer has a beige and turquoise case whose style departs from the boxy designs of other HP printers. It comes with a guide for Setting Up Your Printer". If the "New Hardware Found" box appears click [Cancel]; you must install the software from the CD. It provides support for Windows 95, 98, and Windows NT 4.0, plus Windows 3.1x. [It also works in Windows Me.] This printer uses the #20 black and #49 tricolor cartridges. Your parallel port must be defined as "ECP". This printer will work when connected to an IOMEGA ZIP drive. The 16-page "User's Guide" contains the needed information to set up the printer. There is a 49-page "Online Manual" in the installation CD.The "User's Guide" mentions the printing options on the `Features' tab: two-sided printing, orientation (portrait or landscape). The `Setup' tab will select print quality, paper size, and paper type. The printing speed depends on the complexity of the job and the print quality. You can print envelopes, index cards, and postcards (pp.4-5), and labels and transparencies (pp.6-7). Pages 8 to 10 offer suggestions when things go wrong. The buttons and lights are explained (p.11). You can remove the printer software (p.13) and replace print cartridges (p.14). The printer specifications are listed on page 15.Your electronic equipment must be protected by a surge suppressor. I use another to switch off power to the printer power supply when not in use; heat is the enemy of electronic equipment. There are warnings about the proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. The plastic tape over the nozzles of new cartridges prevents oxidation of the ink. HP seems to have a policy of "planned obsolescence" in manufacturing new printers that use new inkjet cartridges; or it may be due to progress in cartridge design. Like other HP printers the paper path takes a U-turn in printing, so less desk space is needed. HP does not recommend refilling these cartridges."
Apple iPods have sported dock connectors, on the bottom of the unit, since the third generation. However, despite the universal connector, the iPods have been unable to use the same docking station, from one model to the next. Why? iPods come in a variety of sizes, sometimes the same line is made of up different sizes, due to a higher capacity iPod being larger in size.This all means that as someone upgrades, from one iPod to the next, they have had to purchase an entirely new dock. At a price of almost $40, buying a new dock, whenever you buy a new iPod, can be annoying. Apple is trying to make that change, with this new universal dock.This dock comes packaged, in a a beautifully-designed box. Inside, you will find the dock and several adapters. The dock uses adapters, in order to allow it to fit, so many iPods. There are adapters included, for the various sizes of third generation and fourth generation iPods, plus iPod Minis. Adapters for the iPod Nano and iPod Video are not included because those products come with the adapter, when you buy them.To sum up compatibility, the dock will work with any iPod that has the bottom dock connector (which is on all iPods, since the third generation).Features - The most obvious feature is that you connect your normal docking cable, to run from this dock, to your computer. Then, when you're ready to sync music or charge your iPod, you simply slide your iPod into the dock. No fuss. Easy, and a time saver. Furthermore, your iPod looks cool on your desk, when charging or syncing in the dock. There is convenience to the product.Connectors - The back of the dock also features audio-out and s-video out. With the audio out you can connect the iPod to a stereo, or speakers. There is also an s-video output. You can connect an s-video cable between your dock and television, if you have an iPod Photo or iPod video, to output that content.Brand New Feature - Infrared Receiver. The front of the dock features an infrared sensor. This feature can be utilized, if you purchase the new Apple remote, available separately. This allows you to change volume, or tracks, with a remote control, when listening to your iPod through its output (presumably connected to speakers), on the dock.Overall, the new universal dock gives iPod users several new features. Yes, it is yet another dock to purchase, but at least it is compatible, with every iPod that has a dock connector. Furthermore, the outputs and infrared sensor will be useful to many. This universal dock is an accessory many iPod users are going to buy, for the convenience, and it is worthwhile. However, the nearly forty-dollar price tag continues to seem steep. Add the remote, an additional thirty-dollars, and you can be out significant costs. If you think the dock is for you, pick it up. However, if you can live without the convenience and ports, you might wait.
First came the laptops that aim at replacing the desktops. Now Sony is working hard at producing PDAs that strive to replace the notebooks. After spending a week with the UX50, I say their first try is a success, the high price aside.Let me first talk about the cons, so I can focus on the pros more.The screen is quite small. It's 3.5 inches diagonal and packs a 320x480 resolution, (...) , which has a bigger screen. This reminds me of the slim VAIO notebooks: they feature 1280x1024 on a 10.4 screen. Ouch! If you are over age 50, forget this. You'll have a tough time making out the icons.Battery life is also below average, when you have wi-fi or Bluetooth or both on. In fact if you use either one continuously, with backlight set to 3/4, you'll run out of juice in a little over an hour. Kinda scary. I wish Sony would give us a compact battery extender that uses NiMH batteries.Price. Of course everybody thinks this is too expensive. It's expensive, but since it does everything you can imagine, it's cheap compared to notebook. So whether it's a good value comes down to whether you'll use it a lot. Of course, given the battery life problem... You see what I mean.Now the pluses. There are tons of them.First of all, this is a *very* stylish PDA. Pictures don't do it justice. You should go into a store (Staples, Circuit City, etc.) to check it out up close. The exterior design is excellent, with the right amount of curves and edges. It's also surprisingly lightweight. Not for your shirt pocket, of course, but jackets and pants should be ok, unless you wear jeans all the time. What really impresses me is how good the unit feels in my hands, even when I hold it with one hand and use the stylus with the other.Performance is very good, too. You can play an MP3 in the background while doing other tasks and usually you won't notice any delays. Occasionally you do, but that hasn't happened to me often. Apps launch quickly. If you load JPEG files they display quickly, too, unlike on many Pocket PCs.The keyboard is sweet. It has the usual Sony quirks, but it doesn't take long to get used to the keys. The dedicated numeric keys are at the top, where God intended them to be. Shift and Ctrl are sticky, so you need not hold them down to type. All in all the keyboard feels great and well spaced, and I can peck away in no time.The wi-fi function works like a charm. I have Verizon DSL and they have installed lots of hotspots in Manhattan, free for customers. I instantly got wi-fi near a payphone near my office. I surfed for about 15 minutes sitting on the curbside and it never got dropped. Back at home, it works fine with my Microsoft AP. I'm very impressed. Bluetooth, on the other hand, is another matter. (...) The manual is very weak. (...)I can't emphasize enough how great the keyboard is, and working in landscape mode (i.e., horizontal) is fabulous. You can browse the web and edit Office files with so much ease. You get multimedia as well. This is a very well put-together package."
Fuji makes great film that has natural-looking colors, and the price is always better than Kodak. I usually buy Kodak because I prefer buying American when the quality and price differences aren't so large. But for shooting nature, I do have a slight preference for Fuji.
UPDATE (march 10, 2005)Well, I take back the 4-star rating I gave a few weeks ago. I now have serious doubts about Netgear's quality control. I say this because 1) my Netgear router (from this kit) stopped working after just two weeks, and 2) my web search revealed that this is a *common* problem.I wish Amazon could let me revise the rating. I'd now give this kit a 2-star rating. The PC Card, which I have been using heavily, still works fine, although the end plastic (where you hold the card) is coming off loose. At least it still works and does a good job at pulling in and maintaining wi-fi signal.But the router's poor quality pissed me off. It stopped working exactly two weeks after I set it up. All of a sudden I just couldn't get on the Internet. I hadn't done a thing to provoke this. I tried connecting to the net using my old Linksys and D-Link routers; both worked fine. Once I switched back to the Netgear WGR614 router, once again I would lose Internet altogether. I repeated this a dozen times on two different days, resetting the router seven or eight times total in the process, all to no avail, so my conclusion was my router broke.I dialed Netgear's tech support, which is a toll-free number, but I was on hold for too long that I gave up. I'll try again tomorrow, but right now (3/10/05) I'm not hopeful.Given how commonplace this not-working-out-of-nowhere" problem seems, I caution anyone against buying Netgear products, until they improve their quality. BTW, the box of my Netgear kit says "made in Taiwan," but the router and PC Card are both labeled "made in China.""
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk SDCFB-1000-A10 1GB CF Type 1 Card, like most 1000MB cards, will store on average 1137 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 853 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 512 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 409 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 320 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.One last thing to consider when buying a 1000MB card. Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available. A 1000MB card should be an investment. You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity. Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted. Then what do you do? Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Delkin 128MB CompactFlash, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
The Canon PowerShot S410 is a slightly upgraded version of the immensely popular S400 model, which has been discontinued and can be found for close to three-hundred bux. I think since the S410 is only slightly improved -- it is slightly faster than the S400 and sports a new print/share button which I'm not sure you'll be using a lot if you are the typical user -- the S400 is a much better buy.That said, the S410 will be the new standard bearer for 4MP digital cameras. It has a compact form factor, although not as small or light as offerings from Minolta or Pentax or Casio, and it's a bit heavier than you might have expected from the size. It puzzles me why Canon continues to use the older CompactFlash memory card as opposed to the more-standard Secure Digital format. Maybe they simply wanted to save money in upgrading the S4xx series. The plus side is, CF cards are a lot cheaper than SD ones for the same capacity, although the difference is shrinking as expected.Like the S400, the S410 produces excellent image qualities, both indoors and outdoors. It's got the best color and exposure balance from automatic programs among all the cameras I have tested/used. The S410 is slightly faster in taking pictures than the S400, but image quality is largely the same. You won't be disappointed.And as before, the S410 is easy to use, with buttons that aren't too small like on ultra-subcompact cameras from Casio or Pentax. Battery life is about the same as before, which is pretty good and should last you a whole day of moderate shooting. As always, turning off the LCD (via a simple press of the Disp button), turning off the flash, avoid zooming in and out frequently, and using a lower resolution and lower quality will all help preserve battery life (this comes in handy when you realize the battery is about to run out).I wish Canon had increased the optical zoom. 3X is standard but not adequate in a lot of situations, e.g., shooting a stage play your kid's in. But this is only a minor complaint for a camera in this price class.For another hundred bux more, you can get the 5MP S500 model. Should you go for this or the S500? I think for most consumers 4MP is plenty enough, with room for cropping and enlargements. 5MP is only necessary if you really crop a lot. The S410 strikes a great balance between pixel count and price -- it's a good value.
TDK manufactures excellent eight hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. One reviewer correctly notes that revue quality" really means standard quality; but these do a really good job nonetheless. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have up to a total of eight hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording longer television shows, for example. You get up to eight hours of recording time if you choose the longest recording time option on your VHS recorder/player.Of course, the best image quality will be at shorter recording times but many people say they're satisfied with the image they get using the eight hour recording time speed.TDK blank VCR tapes ensure that you get long life out of these blank tapes. Things should look "sharp" and in focus, too.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable, blank VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record. I have used this brand and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK eight hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape."
The 1GB Microdrive has worked well in a Toshiba e755 Pocket PC. It mounts as a folder, just like with flash memory in Pocket PCs. It's fast, silent and reliable, although does draw more power than normal CF cards. The price is right. If you have more to spend, wait for the upcoming 4GB (later this year) and 7GB (and also a rumored 10GB version) early 2004. The new ones will be made by Hitachi.
I have probably close to a dozen hosa adapter cables by now - and they are top notch quality cable. These are just as good, it just happened that my only 1/4 TR to 1/4 TR male to male connectors were 25 feet long and mono (separated meant to make the run from the mixer to the amped speaker) - well I use speakon connectors for that anyways. I've been using the coiled up 25' lines too long to patch in a device on my mixer and finally broke down to buy a set of these. At 6.5 feet they are ideal for interconnecting 1/4 TR devices to my stereo inpus on the mixer. And being a dual cable they don't get tangled into a mess. Finally hosa's lable on the plugs for left/right keeps all in order instead of mixing up the same color black cables meant to head to speakers.I'm glad to have purchased this set - now I have a more complete pathcord kit for audio mixing. Hosa's quality stands head and anltlers above the rest.
Logitech really scores a goal with this awesome headset and microphone for your computer or any other device that has a USB port! It was easy to install into a USB plug and play port; and I have used this for several months now without any regrets.The sound quality is excellent from the headphones which are indeed plush and exceptionally comfortable. The microphone works well with your computer when you are using chat live software that requires a microphone. The microphone frequency response range of 20-20,000 Hz truly impresses me for a headset this affordable.The headband is also adjustable. Initially, I had the headband just too tight and after an hour or so of watching a movie on my computer my head began to ache! The remedy was simple: I merely adjusted the headband to be an inch or two longer so that the headset wouldn't actually touch my head. I remain very satisfied.Another feature of this headset that works wonders is the volume control. You can actually use the volume control to increase the volume beyond which your computer may be capable of achieving! Don't ask me how they pulled that one off; I'm not that savvy about technology. However, the adjustable volume on the headsets proves to be a major selling point. The noise canceling microphone impresses me, too.Some people complain that the volume control isn't placed right on the cord between the headset and the USB port; but I haven't had a problem with this even though I have short arms myself.Overall, you just can't get a better headset with a built in noise canceling microphone for this price. Logitech did a great job with this headset and I highly recommend it for people who want quality without spending a small fortune for a headset with a microphone.Great job, Logitech!
Crosley scores a GOAL with this wonderful, faithful reincarnation of a 1950s/1960s record player that allowed people to stack up to six records at a time for play. The record player is well constructed and rather good looking even with its mesh grillwork in the front.The stack-o-matic proves easy enough to use. Just place up to six records on the top using the upper arm holder to keep them in place. (There are instructions just in case this sounds somewhat vague.) Then just turn on the record player and after the first side of the first record plays, the first side of the second record will be gently dropped onto the turntable for its play--and so on, up to six records at a time. I would not load more than six records at a time.What's more, this single record player can handle a lot. You can use it to play 7 inch 45 rpm records (use the red plastic 45 rpm adaptors that will come with the record player), 10 inch and 12 inch 33 1/3 rpm records and even 10 inch 78s! Caution: I would NOT stack 78 rpm records using this record player. 78 rpm records are EXTREMELY fragile and the drop onto the turntable, even though it's only a few inches, could accidentally break the 78rpm record. Play your 78s one at a time for safety, please!The tone and volume controls are controlled by knobs on the outside of the record player; the other knobs for setting record size and speed are inside the record player just adjacent to the actual turntable. Not bad.Another reviewer on this page states that the two speakers are close together which sacrifices true stereophonic sound--and they are right. The two speakers ARE too close together because they are enclosed inside the record player. I also agree with the other reviewer when they state that many records were released in mono so you won't miss the stereo effect anyway. Besides, if you're as diehard a fan about old records as I am you won't mind this one drawback.The record player also comes with a great needle and cartridge--no worries there! If ever you need a new needle or cartridge, I would advise that you contact Crosley directly to find out if they recommend any specific model number for the needle/cartridge.Overall, this is an excellent record player that I have enjoyed over and over again. The sound is really quite good, especially considering that the two speakers are so close together. The retro look thrills me with its great design; and the fully automatic arm with its needle works wonders to give you long periods of music if you use the stacking records feature.Use it and enjoy it in good health!
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk SDCFB-2048-A10 2GB CF Type 1 Card, like most 2000MB cards, will store on average 2275 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 1706 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 1024 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 819 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 640 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.One last thing to consider when buying a 2000MB card. Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available. A 2000MB card should be an investment. You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity. Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted. Then what do you do? Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

This Exilim EX-Z4 is a great little digital camera! It's about the same size as the Optio S4 from Pentax; in fact the Z4 uses a Pentax lens, so it's possible this is OEM'ed by Pentax? It's slightly heavier (half an ounce or so) than the Pentax, but, on the other hand, the Z4 has a 2 LCD viewfinder! It's just a beautiful viewfinder. The camera works pretty fast and is always ready at your service. The 3x optical zoom is wonderful, and just plain awesome in such a tiny package. I picked Casio because it has a bigger LCD and also it's just a bit cheaper than the Pentax counterpart."
Sony CRX-215E1 CD-RWThe beige bezel Sony CRX-215E1 CD-RW is a typical IDE drive. The manual for this unit contains the instructions for its use. Here are two hints that can be useful to you. One, disable your anti-virus checker when writing (burning") a CD to prevent any possible interference. Then enable it after the writing ends. Two, select the option that tests writing speeds (if possible) to avoid a problem that may prevent a successful completion. This is important when using a slower computer which may not function at the highest speeds possible with this 48x24x48x CD writer.The jumper on the back selects its connection: Master (connects to the end of the cable), Slave (connects to the middle of the cable), or Cable Select (depends on its connection to the end or middle of the cable). On some older computers you should select MA or SL instead of CS. There are standard connections for an IDE cable, power cable, and audio cable. The case for this unit is shorter than others so it can be easier to connect cables in some computers.The CD-ROM interface is governed by International Standards so there is usually no problem in replacing any unit, even if from another manufacturer. This is quite different from video cards, sound cards, or modems which require different drivers even if from the same manufacturer."
Before writing a review on an antenna, you should first explain what you are using it for, and what part of the city/where you live. I live about 20 miles north of Tucson. It's still a pretty metro area (Tucson is growing fast) and it's also slightly hilly. I bought this just to get locals. I used to own a pair of rabbit ears (like $10) that worked ok" but still weren't all that good and could hear a lot of fuzz and bumping from stereo to mono. Most of the radio stations in Tucson are midtown, talk about fuzz and inference! Again, I bought it to get more than just a few stations. And I'm using it for a radio, and to be honest don't want to try it on the TV so I don't have to set it up because it was hard to get the stations in.In the lower frequencies 88-98, it was pretty average and picked up just about as much as a car stereo could. I couldn't get one or two stations perfect, and do have distance fuzz, but I'm not too picky. But then again, I didn't get much more than a pair of rabbit ears. At first, I was a little dissappointed, but at least I could get the stations I frequently listen to.In the 99+ frequencies, a TOTALLY different story. I didn't just get my locals. I did the auto search on my stereo and was picking up all these weird stations, mostly from the Phoenix area. Over 100 miles away! And in stereo with little to no fuzz. I was really impressed. I also liked that there was no inference. On most antennas (especially amplified ones) I'd expect 104.7 and 104.9 to get jumbled a bit but nope, works just fine.The amplifier works pretty good. I tried and returned an RCA rabbit-ear amplified antenna that worked WORSE than the paper clip! The amplifier on this one works really well, I just leave it on the max since I have no reason to turn it down. It doesn't hurt any station, it just makes them better.Terk seems to talk again and again about how compact it is but it's not all that small. It's definitely bigger than a loaf of bread, but it fits on my shelf just fine.On the TV, I'd think the higher channels would work better since that's the case with the radio. Therefore UHF is better than VHF.Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone trying to get a higher numbered frequency that is really far away or has inference. I'd also recommend it for people that live in hilly cities or a lower ground. I wouldn't recommend it for people wanting a lowered number frequency to come in to a like-local sound."
I bought my first one a year ago. I spent close to a cool thousand on it. Ouch! However it was well worth it. I was watching HDTV on TiVo. I live in Orange County, CA and receive several HDTV programs plus DirecTV is getting good with the HDTV service as well with Fox, NBC, ABC, and CBS all in HD (I got in under the radar screen a few years ago and get both east and west coast feeds--they don't allow that anymore though).This unit allows you to record two HD programs at the same time. You can choose your output resolution as either 480i (for recording to DVD for example), 480p, 720p, and 1080i. I have it setup with my 70 Grand Wega XBR Rear projection LCD and I love it. I have the second one hooked up to my 36" 4:3 CRT Wega. As the price comes down I will get another for my Sony 21" 16:9 LCD Panel.If you own a nice HDTV, have DirecTV, and don't have this unit. You are just an idiot. Suck it up son, by it. You will love yourself for doing it within minutes.Note: The USB Ports are just holes in the back of the unit. So don't expect to set it up to your network or use TiVo via the internet. That was the only let down but . . . who cares. I am watching Leno at 7pm, Smallville at 10pm, and CSI on the weekends--all in HDTV. CSI is the most beautiful experience in HD."
This 23 LCD HDTV has excellent image quality and looks really stylish, too. It also comes with HDMI so you can hook up the latest HD video source such as HD-DVD or Blue-ray hi-def DVD players. The LCD panel itself displays vivid, evenly-lit images, and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model.I personally ended up opting for the Sharp LD-23SH1U HDTV LCD monitor because the Sharp works as PC/Mac monitor (plus J&R; started offering a $[...]rebate). But I think this Panasonic is a great choice, too, no doubt about that."
I've had this for about 10 months now and have been very happy. It has good image clarity at SXGA and also fast-switching between different display modes, which is essential for gaming. I use an NEC LCD as my workhorse monitor, but this is my gaming monitor. When it comes to playing games, nothing beats a CRT monitor. I also hook my Xbox to this CTX monitor using the x2vga xbox-to-VGA converter, which gives me HDTV quality when I play xbox games. Check out x2vga.com
Skullcandy makes these headphones; and they are far and away the best set of headphones I've ever had! Just one listen to my portable CD player through these and I was hooked for life. They are remarkably comfortable and they do an excellent job of blocking out all the noise from the room or wherever you may be.The headphones have ear cups" that at first may seem less than completely flexible. Don't worry--within one or two more listens and the ear cups conform perfectly to your ears. They fit relatively snugly without ever being uncomfortable. The headband is adjustable, too, so you can expand or contract the size of the headset.Although these don't come with a warranty (at least where I bought them), you might not need one. They're very reliable and sturdy. Obviously, don't play football with these things; they can break and that somewhat short cord between the earphones and the plug into your equipment is perhaps a bit too short. As one reviewer suggests, you may want some sort of extension cord to rectify this minor inconvenience but that's probably all you're going to need.In addition, these headphones have a small but easy to use feature: a small knob you can move back and forth with your fingertip to adjust the level of the sound independent of the portable CD player or whatever you're listening to. This impresses me as it makes the volume louder than the CD player might be able to go. Great!Overall, I highly recommend these headphones. You can't go wrong."
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any USB device to my PC. Works with my Palm. I bought it for iPAQ rx3400 and it works great.
I've always liked Panasonic DVD players. They are high-quality, easy to use, and always works well, even with dirty DVD discs. The one thing I truly love about Panasonic players is their smooth scan feature: when you fast forward or rewind (there are 4 or 5 speeds), the motion picture is smooth at low speeds and skim gracefully at high speeds. Other players usually &quot;stutter,&quot; but not with Panasonic. The RV32S is another solid model at a great price. Highly recommended.
When I was looking for a pair of powered portable speakers, I looked at this pair from Sony, as well as a couple selections at Radio Shack, all for the same price of $19.99. Compared to the Radio Shack speakers, the Sony has these pros and cons:Pros:- lightweight- better build quality (all are made in China)- accommodates easier-to-find AA batteries vs. size C for RS- slightly better sound with more clarityCons:- no bass or treble controls as on the RS speakers- not as loud as the RS speakers, but the latter gets distorted so bad so the maximum volume is meaninglessIn the end I chose the Sony speakers for better sound and build quality as well as a longer warranty. I use them with my RCA Lyra MP3 Jukebox and also my Panasonic SL-SV550 CD/MP3/Radio player. Pretty happy so far.
The other reviews sum up on this excellent 4MP camera well, I just want to comment on the Microdrive issue. Microdrives draw a lot of power, so if you use one in the S40 expect battery life to drop by at least 60%. Also remember microdrives use moving parts (heads and platters) so you absolutely don't want to drop it. Prices on 512MB CF cards are dropping and 1GB cards are coming, and you can take a lot of picture with them, so microdrives may not be a good investment.
To those who think this shouldn't crash: ipods crash, too, just like apple's computers. But i agree, an mp3 should never crash. it's just slopping programming. This is what happens when American companies offshore intellectual development and stop using American engineers.
Before you buy the S400, you should know it's already over one and a half years old, so it's in the process of being discontinued -- hence the low price on Amazon and elsewhere, even though this list price is still high. That said, this is still probably the best consumer-grade digital camera on the market today. Let me expound.First, 4-MP is the perfect resolution for day-to-day photography. That is, if you are a pro photographer and need the best resolution, you probably want 5+ megapixels. But for us normal mortals, 4MP is already more than enough. You can crop your pictures and still make great 8&quot;x10&quot; blow-up prints. A year ago I would have recommended a 3-MP camera, but right now you can get this 4-MP camera for cheaper than a 3-MP a year ago, so go for this one.Is more pixels always better? Not necessarily. More pixels mean bigger files as well as slower save speed, so it's best to strike a balance between resolution and speed, and 4 MP should be good enough.Second, the picture quality on this Canon is just excellent. Earlier models of Canon (esp. the Digital Elph line) tended to underexpose and yield cold color tones, but the S400 does a very good job of keeping a natural, slightly warmer color range. The pictures are still a little bit softer than sharp images captured by Nikon SLR's, but overall you'll be pleased by the picture quality, both indoors and outdoors. The flash range could be longer, but the same can be said of all built-in flash units.The camera is easy to set up and use, and transfering pictures to Windows XP is a piece of cake. The build quality is top-notch. I highly recommend this camera.
I bought this cards form Eforcity. At first it didn't work, but I carefully looked at how it was seated. Then I reseated it square and it worked fine. The screw mounting bracket is about 1/16 inch off, and requires gently bending the bracket with vicegrips so that the screw mount is correct when the card is correctly flush mounted in the IDE slot. Both tower computers had the mounting screw off by the same exact amount. It can bend the bracket in 5-10 sec and then it works fine.I think the people who had problems probably didn't notice this issue and screwed in the card mount and left the card cockeyed in the IDE slot, and thus it didn't work. Anyways, XP recognized and installed the card fine. WIN ME also installed the card perfectly once I installed the drivers from the included CD. USB 2.0 now works great on both computers, very fast, and very good card. A great price deal.
I bought the RD2840 40GB Lyra jukebox when it first went out sale as exclusive at Circuit City. I've been quite happy with it.Pros: huge capacity (Windows reports 37.2GB total); low price; USB 2.0 High-Speed (=fast transfers!); drag-and-drop file transfers for both music and non-music; recognized by Windows as an external hard disk; graphic EQ plus a few presets; iPod-like interface; includes carrying case and car adapter; backlit LCD screen with adjustable backlight and contrast; good sound quality (after you replace the stock headphones); easy system software set-up (no reboot needed in XP); key lock via Menu button; line-out for hi-fi systems; ability to tag a song &quot;Like&quot; or &quot;Dislike&quot;; ability to import MusicMatch play lists; cute packaging box with handle.Cons: bulky (but surprisingly lighter than I'd expected); too thick; buttons can be unresponsive at times; cannot remember last song played after power down (really stupid! Who designed this thing?); quality seems ok but not as solid-feel as electronics from Sony or other Japanese brands; not much of a printed manual; web support almost non-existent (although you can download the latest firmware update).Overall I like the RD2840, a lot. I had iPod-envy but not any more. Sure it's bulkier and heavier than the iPod, but it's not really too heavy at under 10 oz., and comes with a decent carrying case, plus the value factor is just enormous. I'm not rich by any measure so I couldn't justify shelling out the iPod kind of money. Also, I wanted to use whatever jukebox I'd buy as an external hard drive, and the RCA products are the only ones that can function this way. (Nope, even the new Creative Labs Nomad NX can't double as an external drive. Besides, that product has a really brain-dead desktop program, and its internal drive breaks when you just walk. Avoid the Nomad NX!)Software installation was fast and required no restart, a rarity these days. I skipped installing MusicMatch, since I encode mostly in WMA using Windows Media Player. With native drag-and-drop support via USB 2.0 High-Speed, it's so easy and fast to transfer all sorts of files between your PC and the RD2840. You can use the RD2840 as a back-up hard disk. What happens is after you transfer the files, you *must* do a profiling via the system tray. This is VERY IMPORTANT to keep the RD2840 happy. The profiling process is actually quite fast if you do it after you transfer the files, before you unplug it from the PC. (You can also do it from the RD2840 itself, but it takes longer and consumes battery power.) The profiling basically recognizes all the MP3, MP3Pro and WMA files on the RD2840's hard disk and builds a database. If you don't profile each time after you transfer files, you get unpredictable behavior, which eventually will require a soft reset. (Yep, it has a reset whole, on the left side.)The player supports all MP3 tags, and the blue blacklit LCD screen shows you all the information about each music file. WMA support is flawless. (I don't have any MP3Pro files so I don't know how that works.) I encode all my music in bitrates from 64 kbps (for WMA) up to 192 kbps (for MP3), and the first time I set up the player, I transfered about 2GB of songs. The transfer process took about 5 minutes (I have USB 2.0 High-Speed ports on my laptop), and the profiling took less than a minute. I also copied some documents just to confirm that I could use the RD2840 as an external drive; again the transfer was fast over USB 2.0 High-Speed.So that was tip #1: always profile the RD2840 after downloading files to it. Tip #2 is, be sure to download the latest firmware from RCA's website. There's some confusion as to whether the current update actually does anything for this particular model. You should still download and install it anyway.Tip #3, to maximize battery life, you should always top off the charge by an hour or so. That's just the way LiIon batteries work. If you don't charge it fully, over time its performance will degrade. RCA says you can get 10 hours of play time out of this; I guess the actual battery life depends on how often you press the buttons, the encoding format and rate of your music, and other factors. I found that I get anywhere between 6 and 8 hours, more on the low end, though. Luckily, the AC adpater is pretty compact, and you get a car adapter in the package.The biggest annoyance is that the player can't remember where you were before you shut it off. That's really stupid. On the other hand, the scroll button would scroll slowly first, but if you keep holding it down for 2 seconds, it starts scrolling by page, pausing a bit between pages, which is really nice. The overall interface reminds me of the iPod's, although slightly less refined, but still usable even if you don't read the electronic manual.In summary, the RD2840 is a very capable MP3/WMA jukebox player as well as an external hard drive for Windows PCs. Mac support is rather limited, but Windows users will be happy especially if they heed my aforementioned suggestions.
Sony makes a very reliable blank CD-R that can handle up to 80 minutes of music or 700 megabytes of data. Moreover, these blank CD-Rs are capable of recording data at high speeds. (I looked at one older Sony CD-R disc to help me write this review--would you believe it DIDN'T say the speed at which it records? Sorry!!!) The data I record onto these CD-Rs has now lasted for over three years, proving the test of time. I have used these as data discs and discs to record audio. I almost never got a coaster. Great!The CD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data or music onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your CD-Rs that have anything stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than the packaging advertises. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your CD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the CD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--and you wouldn't want that, now would you? If you need to label the discs, label its' jewel case using a post-it note. At least that's what I do.Overall, Sony blank CD-R discs store data reliably over the years and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at the very highest speed advertised.Use them in good health!
The Princeton SENergy 714 is a very good LCD monitor with sharp image quality and good viewing angles. I'm not sure about the 16ms" response time because different manufacturers measure response times diffrently, making this spec pretty much meaningless. If you are a gamer, you won't be happy with the streaking you'll see when playing fast-action games. If you are a digital photo enthusiast, you should get a Sharp LCD monitor which still has the best image quality, or just opt for a good ViewSonic or Sony CRT, which no LCD can match in terms of color accuracy. But for most people, this is a good 17" LCD monitor for both text and multimedia uses.[...]"
iPods change your life. Simple as that. The ability to carry 1,500 songs in your pocket (or a bunch of audiobooks, one of the many free Podcasts of news, commentary or music 'radio,' and your contacts) is still revolutionary.In addition to the iPods, which are clearly best-of-breed devices (in part because they maintain their simplicity instead of adding buggy feature bloat found in competitors), iTunes and the iTunes music store have run rings around its competitors. That's why iPods have 76% market share -- and rising.About the new mini:It gives you iPod-level functionality in a 3.6 oz. masterpiece of engineering, with newly improved 18-hour battery life to boot. Colors add flash and style that make competitors look oh-so-80s.The Click Wheel input takes a few minutes to master and is far more intuitive than anything else on the market -- which are fully of clunky buttons.Another reason to buy an iPod over a competitor: Add-ons. There are literally thousands of products out there for customizing your iPod.Finally, if you are getting this as a gift for someone else, for heaven's sake, don't go for a 'bargain' player. Especially if this is for someone new to digital music. A big part of Apple's genius is its ability to make its software easy to use for all -- heck, even The Queen has an iPod Mini! If she can use one, so can your mom, your grandmother and your kids. Those same people are likely to look at a Rio like it's an alien from another planet, and when they are forced to use that confusing Windows media software, well, that gadget is going to end up on a shelf gathering dust...Enjoy!
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk SDSDB-256-A1O 256MB Secure Digital Card, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

This Walkman by Sony offers serious music lovers the opportunity to listen to MP3 files stored on a CD, a regular CD (of course); AM and FM radio and seven TV stations. It even sports a weather digital tuner! The remote comes in handy if you don't want to carry the actual player in your hands as you walk about town. Moreover, it only uses a single AA battery at a time and you get lots of play time out of that single battery. Even better still, this portable CD player weighs in at only one pound--this very lightweight machine poses no hindrance if you use it as you walk through the streets. Great!At first glance the controls on the Walkman itself appear intimidating but after about ten minutes tops you learn all the important and most commonly used functions. The controls also make it easy to adjust the levels of bass and change equalizer settings. Other functions, including listening to a TV station, require more concentration and time to learn. However, the instruction manual is fairly clear and if you have questions you can always contact Sony customer support by phone or Internet.The product description on this page indicates that software for making ATRAC" CDs comes packaged with this player. However, when I bought this just last week there was no such bundled software. Instead, the product manual indicates that I need to download the relevant software from the Sony website. However, there remains no extra charge to download the relevant software to make an "ATRAC" CD. The advantage of making an "ATRAC" CD is that you can fit much, much more music onto an "ATRAC" CD than you ever could otherwise when making your own CDs. Indeed, the owner's manual for this Walkman states that you can fit about 30 CDs' worth of sound onto one "ATRAC" CD. Excellent!However, I noticed some disappointments. First, Sony advertises this Walkman as being for the music enthusiast--and they are right. This means that the average layperson like me will have to spend a couple of hours learning how to use ALL the functions of this Walkman. The capabilities of this little machine impress me greatly; but there will be a learning curve for persons like myself. I did not anticipate that. In addition, the buttons are rather small so you need to be careful of how you touch them with your fingers. Finally, the earbuds hurt my ears almost from the very start of listening to a CD on this Walkman. I strongly suggest you purchase a better quality headset or earphones that will be more comfortable.Overall, music enthusiasts will be thrilled with this Walkman. The abundant features amaze me and I believe you will be impressed, too. The quality of the sound is excellent; you can even make the sound constant at a certain level at which the product manual indicates that you won't hurt your hearing as you listen to music or talk on this CD. The shockproof memory and "skip-free G protection" impress me, too. I highly recommend this portable CD player for music lovers everywhere. In addition, if you have the time to learn how to use this machine to its greatest potential, any layperson like me will also come to cherish this Walkman."
This multipurpose 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch paper by Xerox truly works well for all kinds of uses! As you might assume, I use this paper primarily for my computer's printer paper. It does indeed slip smoothly through my printer so that paper jams are very few and far between. The 84 brightness simply indicates that this is good quality paper for printing, handwriting messages, and more.Of course, as I just hinted above, while this paper fits the bill completely for printer paper, you can also use this paper for handwritten messages and even letters. It works well if you give it to your child to cut up and use for arts and crafts projects when they can't play outside. Of course, adults can use this paper for their own artistic projects, too.Moreover, just as the seller advertises, this paper can be used by either an inkjet printer or a laser printer--it even works very well with plain paper fax machines. I love this multipurpose feature. The product description above briefly mentions that this is a blue-white" product but I can't understand why they would risk confusing people that way. You can rest assured--this paper is completely white. SMILEThis paper is sold by the realm--and that means you'll have to comfortably life a single package of 20 pounds. If you have any concerns about lifting you may want someone else to carry this for you if you purchase two or three realms at a time in a store. I know after my complicated hernia operation earlier this year I dare not lift too much weight.Overall, this multipurpose paper will never disappoint you; you can store it for future use without worrying about it fading. As long as it remains in its original paper packaging it will remain white even if you open the package two years from now. I highly recommend this paper for anyone who wants a reliable, good quality paper for office or home use.Use it in good health!!!"
It's no doubt that CD players are still being used today, but MP3 players are still an upgrade from those players. Similar to cassettes...actually similar to an 8-track to a CD player. Everyone knows that the MP3 player market has tons of brands to choose from. Yeah there's Apple, but there's also SanDisk, Creative, iRiver, and so on. But the question is what is more user friendly. I used to own an iRiver H10 and have to say I wasted 300 bucks on that POS. Only in five months the player kept freezing and I'm ending up reinstalling the firmware every three weeks. Finally in July it completely crashed and refuses to add music.At that point, I stated that I simply REFUSE to buy another iRiver. Not again, to Apple I come. Actually I was a little anti-Apple but it seems that millions of people have iPods and work fine, so why on earth would I have trouble? Well, I have to say, I do like my new 5.5 Gen iPod. There are a couple of annoyances but otherwise it is a very decent player.What comes with the player is: the iPod, a USB cable/charger, earbuds, and a slip in-case to resist fingerprints and scratches. The USB cable/charger is a bit underrated by these users. Yes you must eventually buy a seperate charger for long trips but the cord was not short at all. Also it's somewhat nice to have both the home charger and USB cable all in one so I don't worry about losing anything. The earbuds are average. The have a clear sound but less than adequate bass. Also if you're using white cords it's painfully obvious that you have an iPod. I'm currently using my new jWIN earbuds that have a dark cord and sound better than the Apple earbuds. The slip-in case won't protect your iPod at all. You should definitely buy a case, which I'd recommend a camera case, they're cheap and get the job done, plus they have slots for your earbuds. However the slip-in case is good if you like your iPod to be free of scratches (like me).The first step when you wrap your iPod is to download the software. It does take a while if you have dial-up but you, no matter what, will have to use it. iTunes is a fair program and is better than WMP in my outlook. When you have iTunes downloaded you can now import your music and then export them to the iPod. iTunes only goes by ID3 tagging, therefore if you have your music already on your computer you should be mostly set and ready to add. Just drag Music to the iPod and (ta-da sounds goes here), it's on your iPod. It didn't take me long to load my iPod (someone on here said three days, lie I think), I'd use the conversation of 15 minutes per 1,000 songs at 192 kbps. Especially a decent time since I have USB 1.1. It'll probably move faster if you used AAC but slower if you used a hefty rate like 320 kbps. The computer suprisingly ran just as well with no iPod, while when I connected my iRiver H10 it was always a big issue.When you get your music, videos, and photos on your iPod, it's up to you at this point. The best thing I'd do is get the album artwork for any music you have on your computer already. All you have to do is go to your music, select all, and click get album artwork. You do need an iTunes account but it's very simple to set-up.The categories on the iPod are set-up very neat, making it simple to find what you want. There's also a well designed search function which is useful if you have a large collection of music.Otherwise, the iPod has a few extras you might enjoy. Nope, it still has no FM tuner, but I'm thinking who cares if you have such a large collection of music, which made an FM tuner not a big deal to me. It has a clock which is nice but not a biggie. It has the ability to store contacts with pictures which is a good bonus (it would be really cool to see a phone in here or wireless internet on a later generation). It also has a calendar with a built-in alarm, but the alarm isn't very loud so keep your alarm clocks. You can also enter in text files, a good idea if you're a heavy reader. A little stopwatech is also included. And if you want people to lay off your iPod, there's also a screen lock which makes it impossible for people to get in. For other settings, there's a volume limit if your buying this for a kid and don't want to kill their ears before they turn 60. You can adjust brightness and backlight settings to save some of your precious battery life.The sound quality from the iPod is good, but I found the bassier presets to be too much and distort a bit. My heart-set preset is hip-hop, providing good but not overwhelming bass and clear mids and highs.The iPod also features games. This was a hit or miss for me. They were fun to play but ran somewhat choppy while listening to music. Not to the point where they're unusable but slightly annoying. If you didn't know you can buy extra games for five bucks each at the iTunes store. A little pricey if you ask me, but I did end up buying Zuma and don't regret it. And of course you can buy music, TV shows, and music videos on the store as well. Movies can be purchased, but the selection is slim so you may want to check out other services for that. Gift cards are avaliable at every store in the world. I've even seen them at Walgreens!Some annoyances (or bugs) first started on the Click Wheel. I did enjoy it and will more the next couple of weeks but there's no way to change the speed of it. I wish there was because it was way too fast for me at the beginning and was hard to play some of the games and hard to scroll through things. After a week of owning it I've adapted to it but I hope the next firmware update fixes this. It only charges through the USB which can be slightly annoying so you might want to find a USB charger to wall for trips. This may also be not a good thing for older computer users. Mine is only a year and a half old and charged through USB just fine but it might not for computer older than five years. One last annoyance (actually a bug) is that when I disconnect my headphones the song automatially stops. I'm not sure why, it could be friction from the plug, but no other player I've owned has done this before.For durability, I've only owned it for a day so far so I will definitely do an update but so far it seems to be durable enough for me. I bought a very strudy camera case and use the soft case that comes with the iPod and I'm sure that'll protect it very well. People say it's prone to scratches and fingerprints but I'd say tat both the screen and the iPod are not too prone to scratches or fingerprints, but the back is a complete disaster. I bought the white anyway so if it does get scratched it won't be a huge ordeal.Although some bugs need to be fixed on the 6th generation, this iPod is definitely a good upgrade from the 4th generation and an excellent upgrade from a CD player. I will update as problems or good things come up, but for now this was definitely worth the purchase and the offical step up from CDs. 4 stars.
When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer. The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world. In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini. Why? They had something better: the iPod Nano.Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, impossibly small," and "magic." While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.Reliability - Are you worried that such a small and light music player is unreliable? Don't be! The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit.Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs. The 2-gigabyte model is available for $50 less, but a 2x increase in storage capacity makes this 4-gigabyte model, the best value.Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around.Color - White is the traditional iPod color, and it will match many of your other Apple products. Furthermore, white is less likely to show scratches and fingerprints.Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the Nano, and its going to make my life a lot more fun. Gigabytes of music in 1.5 ounces, so there really is no limit to where the music dan go. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason."

Buffalo Tech's WLE-DA2 is a small, lightweight indoor directional antenna that boosts your wi-fi signal. I've been using one for six months now and have been very happy with its performance.The directional" nature of this antenna means it broadcasts in one direction. In its line of sight, it can maintain 11Mbps speed as far as 100 meters (300 feet); if there are walls or other obstructions, this distance will obviously be shorter. When I place the antenna facing out my apartment window, I can get a useable wi-fi signal inside a small street corner park about 50-60 meters away.You should check the product image I posted next to the product name. The graphic, downloaded from Buffalo's website, shows the range of its coverage. The reddish orange fan is the "optimal" range, whereas the light orange area can theoretically give you wi-fi throughput of 1Mbps, but in my experience, anything further than 100 meters or so makes the wi-fi signal impossible to use reliably.BTW, how effective the Buffalo antenna's range also critically depends on your wi-fi client card (i.e., the adapter inside your PC that pulls in the signal). When I use the built-in wi-fi adapter in my ultralight Sharp Actius MM20 (only 2-lb. light!), I get the aforementioned 60 meter range in the direction of the broadcast. If I use my significant other's Netgear WG511 wi-fi PC Card adapter, I can go as far as 100 meters, even when there's a glass window blocking the path of the broadcast.If the signal has to go through walls, the useable distance will drop significantly. My experiment showed that the signal from Buffalo can go through about 8 average-thickness walls (~100 feet in length including the rooms between walls) before the signal becomes weak and moody.Since this antenna, with a total gain of 9dBi but effective gain of 5.4dBi due to signal loss on the 9-ft. long cable, broadcasts in one direction, it's best placed next to a wall to face your cient machines. You can adjust the antenna face's angle to suit your needs. If you want an antenna that broadcasts in all directions, get a Buffalo Tech omni-directional antenna.(BTW, always check the gain rating *including* cable loss. The WLE-DA2's total gain is 9dBi, but the 9 ft. cable cuts down the effective gain to 5.4dBi. I've seen antennas with total gain of 12 or 13 dBi but an effective dBi of just 2 or 3, which is pathetic.)th WLE-DA2 is compatible with Buffalo's MC connector as well as the more popular RP-TNC connector, making it compatible with virtually all wi-fi routers on the market today. The antenna requires no external power, and can be wall-mounted (kit included in package). It's compatible with 2.4Ghz 802.11b and 802.11g routers. No software is needed at all. Just be careful when you unscrew the current antenna from your wi-fi router.A two-year warranty makes this an even better value. The product is made in Japan, a rarity for computer peripherals these days.If you are lookign for an effective way to boost your wi-fi signal, I highly recommend this Buffalo Tech product. For me, it's been working beautifully, converting previous dead zones inside and outside my apartemnt to live, kickin'-well wi-fi sweet spots.Finally, a word of caution: since your wi-fi signal will be boosted tenfold or more, you should absolutely pay attention to wi-fi security. Turn on WPA (and get a WPA wi-fi router if yours doesn't suport WPA), choose a hard-to-crack password, turn on MAC (machine access code) control, and turn off SSID broadcast. Good luck!"
The typical american household has wall outlets spaced 6 feet apart with 2 outlets each. When you had the light bulb, the vacuum, and the mixer, that was plenty, but in todays world where you have the blu ray player, the flat screen tv, the coffee maker, it just doesn't work! What is worse is that those transformers, expecially the heavy ones tend to fall out of the worn out wall outlet.That's where this product fills the bill - it takes up one plug opening and gives you 4 so you net 3 extra, but they are 14 out on 4 dedicated tails. Now there have been powerstrips designed this way with 5 tails, and I own a few of them, but what I do not like is the big button for on/off - lean on it accidentally and suddenly 5 things downstream get shutoff. Here there are no circuit breakers nor switches to interrupt the flow, and if you are using it for low power chargers and such you really dont need them.I had no problems finding 4 transformers to plug into the outlets and then plugged the plug end into the wall. So much cleaner than using the 6-way adapter plug that I had previously put on the outlet. Another advantage is that the old style plugs had one screw in the center, while the new style [decora] have 2 screws top and bottom, and the even newer style (color coordinated leviton designer outlets) have clips with no screws at all to hold on your adapters to the wall outlets.The other advantage of this is its portable - i can toss it in my overnight bag or laptop case and run all my chargers off just one outlet at the admirals club in the airport. I've even had people ask to use one of my empty outlets because everyone is charging their laptops before the flight.For the price, it's a bargain at cleaning up messy cords. With the keep it simple policy I can honestly say it will get alot of use, plus the cables are rated for high power items, which is a plus when running power tools at the end of an extension cord that has one outlet - just plug this in and have 4 outlets."
Shopping around at a refurbished store, I found these on sale at $10. I bought them, because the original price is $20, so they should be pretty nice. And they are.SOUND QUALITY (5 stars) -The sound on these headphones is outstanding for the price I paid. The bass is very deep, and the treble is pretty clear as well.COMFORTABILITY (4 stars) -The comfort is pretty good. They do seem to press somewhat hard after some hours, but overall, the comfort is good. The headband is very soft, and the headphones are pretty adjustable.PORTABILITY (2 stars) -Ok, get real, anything this size is unportable. They aren't foldable, and I wish they were. I guess I can use h.ears for portable purposes, because the h.ears don't sound as good.COST (5 stars) -The cost was very good. I can't believe I paid such a low price for this quality.Overall, the EH710 are recommended for people who like quality sound and aren't big travelers.
If you are looking for a budget-oriented LCD monitor, this 15 from Sceptre is an excellent choice. The 15" LCD panel is sharp and bright and has good response times. The on-screen menu is a bit confusing, just like most monitors. The built-in speakers sound very cheap, so I wouldn't recommend relying on them for your music experience. But in the one area where it counts -- display quality -- the Sceptre provides more bang for the buck than any 15" LCD I've seen. A good monitor to get for Internet surfing and Word processing. And you can also watch DVD movies on this, assuming your PC has a DVD-ROM drive."
I recommend buying Simpletech's Secure Digital Reader to save time and ease. I use it with my 64 mb secure digital card and Ipaq H3850. It plugs straight into my USB port and was impressed with the transfer rate.
With most companies toner cartridges are ultrasonically welded shut to prevent any attempt at refilling them with toner. It's how the manufacturer makes their money - from supplies. We know that you will run out of toner long before the drum unit looses its photo response. Brother actually put a white plug in the cartridge that you remove to pour more toner into the TONER compartment, then keep on printing. For me, this is a first on small printers. Big printers ($60K+) often get their toner in a bag that you shake into the jar while small units ding you for the cartridge approach.It also seeks to minimize waste in landfills by getting 3 or more fills in the same cartridge that is not worn out yet.Note - after 3 fills, the waste toner" chamber can get full, making black prints or grey prints since the toner isn's scraped off well. It's a function of what you print - graphics is heavy usage, while text is about 5%."
I bought this item for my dad because he liked mine so much. And now he loves his.
TDK manufactures excellent, extra high grade six hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have six hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording television shows, for example.In addition, you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time, four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording. (You use your VCR to set this.) The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they're satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The extra high grade of this blank VCR tape ensures that you get longer life out of these blank tapes. Moreover, if you record a special event on these for a permanent video recording the quality of the video on the tape will outshine the quality of the video on the regular version of this VCR tape. Things should look sharper" and be a little bit more in focus, too.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable, blank extra high grade VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record. I have used this brand and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK extra high grade six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape."
I bought this as an alternative to the more expensive Apple A/V cable, and it works absolutely perfect with my iPod. Both the sound and video quality are beautiful!
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk 128MB Memory Stick, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Ok, you are a cool-looking road warrior with your latest high-tech laptop running Windows XP. You hate the touchpad, though, so what do you do? The MouseMan Traveler is the answer. It's a small, lightweight mouse with a cool design. Unlike other mice with two obvious buttons, this one uses one piece of thin metal to cover the actual button touch points. Very easy to use. It's also comfortable to hold even for someone like me with big hands, but the &quot;buttons&quot; are slanted in such a way as to make clicking take some getting used to. It should have a &quot;fuller&quot; feel in the hand. But, unlike many notebook mice, it's both lefty and righty friendly.It works beautifully right after you plug it into a Windows XP computer. For those on legacy systems, driver software on a mini-CD-ROM is included, as is a USB-to-PS/2 adapter. Also included is an extension cord, so you can use the mouse either in the short form, or in the long form. Very considerate of Logitech.The mouse is about 2/3 the size of regular mice and feels solid and well built. It's a winner. I was attracted to it by Circuit City's rebate this week, which essentially gives me 50% off the regular price. But even at the regular price, this would have been a great value and a great companion to the many road trips.

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The FujiFilm 256MB xD Picture Card, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
As about two or more reviewers got this for the holidays, and so did I. I have to say, this camera is great. I'll just break down pros + cons because it's an electronic devicePROS:- With the 4.1 megapixels, picture and video quality is clear and crisp.- Easy menus.- Overall easy to use if a beginner.- Many different ways and styles to take pictures.- Very durable, as Sony products are mostly all trustful.- Love the zoom in and zoom out features.- Easy to delete videos and pics.- Easy to connect to a computer or a television.CONS:- The memory stick that came with this is only 16MB which is only 8 pictures and 42 secs for video. Luckily, I also got a 256MB memory stick seperatly and I can take about 120 pics and 11 min for video.- The batteries were not charged up when I recived the product.- Sound on the videos are sometimes weak.Overall, this camera is great, but make sure to buy a seperate memory stick or you will only have 42 seconds of fun with the video and only 8 pics.
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any USB device to my PC. Works with my Palm. I bought it for Treo 650 and it works great. A whole lot cheaper than what cellular stores want for these.
The Multipass F80 is the best multi-function machine for home use. It's not designed for heavy, industrial usage, but has solid quality for everyday home user's needs. It's pretty good as a color printer, but it's the color fax function that's really cool. Its small footprint fits most desks well, too.
[Note: I have the white version of D-NE320, but feature-wise and operation-wise, the different versions are identical. Hope my review and price tip help you.]Even though I love my Sony NW-HD3 20GB MP3 player, when I listen to my beloved classical music collection, I still much prefer CDs, since when it comes to sound quality, MP3 simply cannot match the original CD recording. This Sony CD player is great for classical music (as well as jazz and vocals, or anything that an audiophile loves). You can feed the output to a high-end amplifier and get unbeatable sound. Or use a good pair of headphones.This CD/MP3 player is also great for books-on-CDs. Ripping CD audiobooks is a pain and a tedious process. So it's simply easier to listen to the CDs direcly, and this lightweight, stylish, easy-to-use CD player is just PERFECT for that. And it runs for days on a single AA battery. (Hint: get Panasonic's new Oxyride AA batteries for double the life of even the best alkalines.)I just love this portable CD player. If you are also an audiophile or an audiobook lover, this is perfect for your needs.The only minor gripe is the player doesn't support WMA, which would have been even more fantastic for ripped audiobooks (better quality, smaller files). MP3 still takes too much space at the usual 128kbps bitrate. If I were to rip, I'd want to rip into 48kbps WMA and would still get great sound quality. (But I don't have the patience to rip anyway...)BTW, this player (and the black version) are actually cheaper on Sony's consumer website, sonystyle dot com, where it sells for $49.95. I should have checked there first.UPDATE: I was happy to discover that the inline remote control that comes with the D-NE320 also works on my Sony NW-HD3 20GB MP3 player. Awesome!

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Verbatim 2GB CompactFlash Memory Card, like most 2000MB cards, will store on average 2275 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 1706 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 1024 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 819 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 640 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.One last thing to consider when buying a 2000MB card. Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available. A 2000MB card should be an investment. You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity. Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted. Then what do you do? Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Back in Decmember 2003, I decided it was time for a new DVD player. Not only would my Panasonic refuse to play some DVDs, but it didn't have a VCR, and all I had was a cheap, Funai VCR that had awful quality. So, as a fan of some earlier Sanyo products, I checked out the DVW-6000 (Amazon's model # is incorrect). This player so far has served me great.The DVD player is great. It reads discs great, and barely skips, if at all. It has a screen to keep track of the playing time of the DVD. Somehow, there is no rewind or fast-forward buttons on the DVD player, which means that you will need the remote. Luckily, if you happen to lose it, it works with 2 of 2 Universal remotes I've tried (Dish Network and RadioShack). The open/close button is not at the bottom of the door so it's easy to press.The VCR is a very nice add-on. Also, there is no rewind or fast-forward buttons for the VCR either, so keep the remote in a safe place. The picture quality on the VCR is very good. The only problem is that the sound quality on VHSs that you record from it is very poor. Both on this, my Philips, and my Emerson units not only record better, but they also experience a problem from the Sanyo recorded tape. Although a major flaw, the rest of the unit is almost flawless.The unit has two AV inputs, one in the front on the right (see picture) and one in the back. Also has a very easy setup. You can either set it up using the yellow, white, and red jacks and put them in the slots on the TV and the unit, or you can use cables if your TV doesn't have AV jacks.I was and am pleased with this unit. I have owned it for 1 an d 1/2 years and it is still in great condition, though I'm thinking about replacing my crap Memorex TV with a DVD/VCR combo and putting this in the living room. I'm still going to check around for a Sanyo model before making my decision.

A solid DVD player that does progress scan when you use the component video output. Quiet and easy to use. Not great if you watch a lot of pirated DVDs because the Panasonic is picky about the quality of the disc.
I went to my friend's house and to notice, he had purchased a 20GB Ipod. I asked him if I could try it out. I noticed that the Ipod earbuds were not pluged in. Instead, were the Sony H.EAR headphones. I thought, why not rate these headphones on amazon.com? I already looked at them and knew they were gonna be bad. They were cheap earbuds that had a hook on them. Of course, the sound is going to be trebly and they will be uncomfortable.... Not so.The sound quality, I thought, was excellent. The bass was kinda deep, but not as good as overhead headphones or the closed-ear kind. The trebles were very clear. For sound quality, especially for earbuds, was amazing.Actually, the first thing I thought when I put these on was These are very comfortable, and fit just right." Unlike other clip-style headphones. The plastic isn't adjustable, but it is bendable so it stays on your ear in a comfortable manner.These are obviously portable, due to the fact they're small earbuds with a hook on the end of them. They each are about a size of an overhead headphone speaker.The cost is about right. I don't think they are an extreme deal or anything, but $10 for these is quite right.I think I'm going to buy these soon. Ok, if you've read my other reviews, I also own the HL150, MDR101LP, and MDRG42LP. Well, I don't use the MDRG42LP because the are so uncomfortable. And, the MDR101LP I can probably sell to oneo f my friends for maybe $1.Anyway, you could carless about that. So, these headphones are great for the price. But warning, do not buy if you have extremely big ears, they will likely keep falling off. Look at the amazon.com image first too. But, I think these headphones will fit almost everyone, and that shouldn't be too much of a deal.P.S. I also found it interesting that the warranty doesn't cover acts of God, accident, misuse, or abuse. WTH? That basically elimanates the warranty right there. Is there any other way these things can break?"
I bought this charger set for my friend as a bithday gift. She says this charger set is excellent for her to charger her battery anywhere, such as at home, traveling or on the road. It allows her catch up all greatful sight.
I bought this item to my brother. He said this charge set can charger the battery anywhere and will not miss out the wonderwork sight.
(Note: there seems to be a pricing error on Amazon.com as of today. I bought it from Amazon for $170 last week.)Just got my new Seagate 160GB external drive and set it up in under a minute after unwrapping. The first thing I did was to reformat the drive into NTFS, which allows for gigantic file sizes, is faster than the old FAT, and provides for security features under Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP Professional.(Note: You should definitely convert the drive to an NTFS volume if you use it only with Win2k or WinXP. Seagate provides a disk mgmt utility but it's very confusing to use. Instead, simply use Windows' built-in convert command to convert the drive without formatting and without losing any information you might have already put on the drive. Go to a DOS prompt and type &#34;help convert&#34; to see the options for &#34;convert.&#34; A typical use is: c:\&#62;CONVERT E: /FS:NTFS --&#62; this converts the E: drive, which in my system is the Seagate when plugged in, to NTFS. The process only takes about a minute if you do this on the fresh drive.)Externally, the Seagate is pretty compact, measuring about 7&#34;x7&#34;x2.5&#34;. Assembled in the U.S., the unit looks and feels solid. It's equally friendly with Windows and Macintosh, supporting plug-and-play on both platforms and the included backup software has both versions. (I use Retrospect myself.)This 7200RPM drive is fast. I use it over USB 2.0 and it's the fastest external drive I've tested. I did the testing by copying a couple very large files and also by copying a large number of small files (e.g., IE cookies). Both tests showcased the drive's raw speed. I'm pretty happy as I plan to use this as my video editing drive.The bundle comes with a nicely written and nicely printed getting started guide, a USB cable, a 6-pin IEEE 1394 cable, a stand, and the two-piece power adapter. The last item is the disappointment in this otherwise well-designed package. The AC adapter is an ugly brick, and there's a separate power cord. The PS2-style connector also feels loose, so be careful not to knock it out of the socket on the drive.Fast, quiet, plug-and-play, fairly stylish, and supporting both USB 2 and IEEE 1394, this Seagate drive looks like the definite winner in the external drive category. If you want more space there's a 200GB version available.I just hope this will last me a long time, as my last external drive (a Maxtor) died after just a year.
The money I saved was fantastic, and I cannot tell any difference in the quality of my printing.
This mini USB to USB 2.0 cable works perfectly when I need to connect my Garmin GPS to my PC's USB port. This is particularly useful for Garmin's GPS online product registration and map update downloads. The quality of the cable is rather good; it just plain feels well constructed and it has never failed to work for me; I have no complaints about this product. Although another reviewer wrote that their cable was shorter than the 6 foot length that is advertised here, mine is just about 72 inches long.Some other cables will cost you more but you'll get the same quality as you will with this cable. I can't see why you should spend more so I highly recommend this item.

I've had this for almost a year now. It's a high-quality CD player that also plays back MP3 files burned on CD-R/RW discs. It's very power-efficient and uses only one AA battery which lasts a long time (if you use alkaline). The buttons arrangements need a bit getting used to and to do random play requires going through a menu, but the player is otherwise easy to operate. The build quality is very satisfying as I've dropped this a few times but it still works beautifully unscathed. CD players are still the best for getting the most out of CD music, esp. classical music, which I love.
While the new long life" NIMH cells have made a tradeoff of lower self discharge for lower capacity, people who charge their batteries just before use (e.g. before a photo shoot) will appreciate the extra capacity of the 2700 mah cell. A typical 1 month old eneloop cell will deliver 1500 mAh, while a freshly charged sanyo 2700 cell does deliver 2700 mAh. That's nearly twice the energy available. While the eneloop cells work well in remote controlls and devices that don't get alot of use, the high capacity cells should be considered for photoflash, digital camera, and other high drain applications.As shown in the photos above these are shipping in 2 wrappers, the white sanyo and the green sanyo/ge - the cell inside appears electrically identical but marketed differently.There are alot of cells packaged 24-100 ea per pack from various made in china battery companies - while labeled 2500-2700 mAh, tested against the sanyo these bulk batteries barely hit 1000 mAh and many don't make it that far despite their label. The local frys has been moving these by the pallet at bargain basement prices but they are not true high capacity cells. To date I've only seen sanyo and Yuasa make a real 2700 mAh (guarateed 2500) cell which is more charge than even alkaline batteries, albeit at 1.3V instead of 1.5V - if you need a higher voltage a new nickel iron chemistry has hit the market at 1.65 V and is rechargableThe 2700 mAh sanyo / GE battery comes in different colored cells (some white/orange some silver/green but the same battery). In all my testing the 2700 GE/Sanyo has been by far the best NiMH AA.The eneloop scheme means the batteries come "pre-charged" but only hold 2000 mAh, or about 75% of these out of the charger. You pay every time you use them for that convenience of having it charged when you get it. That's a Win once, loose a thousand times in a row scenario. You can't even get those odds in Vegas.The 2700 has consistently been a top performer, exceeding MAHA's offering at 2700 (which comes out under 2500 on their own tester). In real use, products that would run for 1 day on "normal" 1850 mAh cells or NiCd cells run almost 2 days on the 2700 sanyo's.Trying to find these has been difficult. I bought some 2 weeks ago and now they are "unavailable" - HELLO AMAZON - RESTOCK THESE - Christmas is comming and we need them!Finally - these offer tremendous current capacity so your cameras and flashes will charge and operate faster.Having tested over 2 dozen brands and sizes of batteries, these came to the top of the pack quick. At 12.99, their price to performance number was excellent too. You can pay more, but you can't find a better performing cell."
I liked the &quot;old&quot; e755 with 2002, and now it's even better with PPC 2003. Never had a problem with my unit, and the new OS does seem a bit faster, having been optimized for the XScale. Battery life is also a bit better, especially when using wi-fi, which is a very good thing.

The ML-L3 is a small plastic remote control for Nikon's SLR cameras. There's just one button on the ML-L3; you'll set the control mode on the camera itself (e.g., immediately shutter release vs. delayed shutter release). Just point to the IR receiver on the camera (usually on the front) and press the button. A small, cheap-feeling pouch is included with the remote control.Reviewer technology analyst" has it right: Nikon should just include this in their SLR and d-SLR kits, esp. the kits that cost over $500. This remote control is made in China so it probably costs them a couple bucks to make (thanks to the unregulated sweatshops in China!), and they would have generated a lot of good will among Nikon owners and potential SLR buyers."
When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.The iPod Nano may well be one of the most impressive products ever produced, by Apple Computer. The iPod Mini was the best selling iPod, making the iPod Mini the best selling portable music player, in the world. In fact, it had only be released in January 2004, and it was updated in early 2005. However, in September 2005, Apple decided it was going to stop producing the iPod Mini. Why? They had something better: the iPod Nano.Apple CEO and co-founder, Steve Jobs, calls the creation, impossibly small," and "magic." While it might be a stretch to refer to the Nano as impossible or magic, it is the first reaction one has, when they see the product.Size - The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. Weight is another jaw-dropping figure. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.Reliability - Are you worried that such a small and light music player is unreliable? Don't be! The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit.Storage - This 4-gigabyte iPod Nano is capable of holding approximately 1000 songs. The 2-gigabyte model is available for $50 less, but a 2x increase in storage capacity makes this 4-gigabyte model, the best value.Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around.Color - White is the traditional iPod color, but this black iPod nano is proving to be incredibly popular. Just note that the black is more likely to show scratches and fingerprints.Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason."
I recently purchased this product for use in my C64 printer, and the only difference that I saw was the ink lasted much longer then the Epson ink.
I purchased a cartridge for home use through my office, the printing quality was as good as the HP brand I was using previously, and the cartridge lasted longer. I have purchased three more cartridges since, and will continously do so.
Sony makes a very reliable blank DVD-R that can handle up to 4.7 GB of data. Moreover, these blank DVD-Rs are capable of recording data at speeds up to 16x. The data I record onto these lasts for years, proving the test of time. I have used these as data discs, discs to record video and discs to record audio. Great!The DVD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your DVD-Rs that have data stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than 16x. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your DVD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the DVD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--and you wouldn't want that, now would you? If you need to label the discs, label its' jewel case using a post-it note. At least that's what I do.Overall, Sony blank DVD-R discs store data reliably over the years and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at 16x.Use them in good health!
The Mac Mini was released in January 2005 at Mac World, and was then updated, for the first time, in July 2005. This Mac Mini is the result of that update.Improvements - The $699 Mac Mini is a new model, in the respect that previously only $599 and $499 models were offered. The $699 model is indentical to the $599 model, but includes a superdrive, for burning DVDs. This Mac Mini sports 512 MB of DDR SDRAM, which is twice the memory the original Mac Mini included. This is a significant upgrade. The majority of users can now buy, out of the box, a machine that performs beautifully and allows a fair amount of multi-tasking. The Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger, thrives on memory, and 512 MB helps to create a speedy experience, for users.Bluetooth - Bluetooth is a great wireless technology that Apple heavily backs, and it is included with this Mac Mini, an addition, from the original Mac Minis, when bluetooth was an optional add-on, (...), for $50 more. Purchase a bluetooth keyboard or bluetooth mouse, and they will work wirelessly, with your Mac Mini. It makes for a very clean and uncluttered desktop. There are also many mobile phones and PDAs, which utilize bluetooth technology, which you can sync to your mac using isync, included with Mac Mini.Airport Extreme - This is the wireless networking card now included with the $599 and $699 Mac Mini, after being a $70+ upgrade (...), on the previous model. Do you have a wireless-b or wireless-g network in your home? If so, the Mac Mini will be able to connect to it, without problem. Again, making the computing experience simpler and less tangled.The Good Things that Continue to Shine with Mac Mini - A buyer of the Mac Mini will continue to enjoy Mac OS X Tiger, which is the best consumer operating system in the world. It works with the hardware beautifully to provide a simple, fast, elegant, and reliable experience. One of the favorite descriptions of Mac fans, to describe Macs, is simply, it just works."The Mac Mini continues to include iLife '05, with great applications such as iPhoto, iMovie HD, iDVD, iTunes, and Garageband. These are all included, with every Mac Mini. You will be challenged to find any PC that includes applications that come anywhere close to the iLife suite. Manage thousands of your digital images in iPhoto, create home movies in iMovie, burn those movies onto DVD with iDVD, and create professional music in Garageband.Appleworks is included for simply word processing, spreadsheets, etc., but you might want to pick up Microsoft Office for Mac. A student/teacher edition is available, for just over $100.Speed - The 1.42 GHZ PowerPC G4 processor makes the Mac Mini a very capable machine. This will satisfy the horsepower needed to complete tasks in the iLife suite, included with your Mac Mini.Hard Drive - 80 GB is a significant-sized hard drive, so you will be able to store thousands of photos and songs.Superdrive - The Apple Superdrive not only allows you to burn CDs and watch DVDs, but you can also burn your very own DVDs! Just imagine editing your home movies in iMovie, and then burning them to DVD, with iDVD via your Superdrive. iDVD allows you to make beautiful menus, for your DVDs, so they look professional.Drawbacks? The $699 version of the Mac Mini does not include a modem, if you want this version of the Mac Mini with a modem, you will have to custom-order it at Apple.com. However, the ethernet port is included on the back, to plug into a DSL or cable modem, plus you have the Airport Extreme, for wireless connections. However, if you don't have broadband, you'll need a modem for dial-up, so you will either need to order a custom-built Mac Mini at Apple.com, or buy the stock $499 model, which includes a modem, but lacks the wireless components, superdrive, 80 gig hard drive, and faster processor.What is the best value of the three Mac Mini models? The $699 model is *fantastic*, if you want to burn DVDs, or simply backup data to DVDs. Remember, a DVD holds 4.7 GB of data, so that allows you to backup a lot of data. However, if you think you do not need the Superdrive, the $599 model offers the exact configuration to the $699 model, albeit absent the superdrive.Overall, Apple has created another fantastic product, with the Mac Mini, and the July 2005 update only made it better. You get more memory, plus wireless connectivity via bluetooth and airport extreme. This Mac Mini really includes everything the average user needs to enjoy the internet, manage his or her digital life, and have fun doing it all."
Nice Unit with USB 2.0 and Firwe Wire 400, This unit is GREAT! Oxford chipset for Mac users. Fast transfer through Firewire, runs cool fan is nice feature
This HP 21 inkjet cartridge is very light, easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality, durable black ink on the page. It stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (It even comes with an expiration date!) HP also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit.One thing that I didn't like, however, is that the ink can go quickly. If you print a lot, you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. My needs are about 15 pages per week and I have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks. That's not good; although to be fair to this HP ink cartridge I am printing graphics.Four stars for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge. It loses a point for not lasting longer.
GREAT!!!! The feeling is rigth, the weigth is rigth and it fits perfectly! It comes with caps for Sony Clie.
The Exilim EX-Z40 is a small wonder to look at and hold ... and to actually use. It's arguably the best-looking digital camera on the market today. One look at it and you'll want to buy one. The matching cradle is also just as cute."Picture-quality-wise, it's good, but not as good as Canon's offerings. There's a certain softness to the pictures it takes, and you cannot adjust the sharpness level like you can on many (admittedly larger) cameras. The 2" LCD is just totally wonderful, but does put on some drain on the dimunitive battery.All in all, a pretty good package if a bit expensive. It's definitely something you can impress a lot of people with."
I got this as a second progressive scan (&quot;PS&quot;) DVD player and have been very impressed. The price is right, and the overall quality of the player is very good, especially compared to lesser-quality brands like Apex and Samsung. What truly stands out is the video output quality. When connected to a digital TV monitor (EDTV or HDTV) the details from many recent DVDs are just incredible. BTW there's no point hooking up this player (or any PS-capable player) to an old analog NTSC TV since the latter cannot take advantage of the PS signal. Progressive Scan means each time the TV displays a frame of the image, all the lines are displayed, as opposed t NTSC's &quot;interlaced&quot; technology. Not only does PS give smoother, clearer motion pictures, but clean paused pictures as well. The Panasonic DVD-S25K is an outstanding PS player to own.
IOMEGA ZIP 250 DiskThe IOMEGA ZIP 250 disk is a high-capacity removable storage disk that is about the size of a standard 3.5 floppy disk. It can be read and written by an internal IDE drive (only one per system) or an external drive connected to a USB port or a parallel port (slowest in access). The IomegaWare Software provides utility functions designed for the ZIP disk, such as formatting or copying a disk. You should never use the Operating System disk copy function. Use the EJECT utility to remove a disk from a drive; this is required in Windows NT or Windows 2000. Remove the disk before turning a computer off You should never insert a ZIP disk in the drive when the computer is on as this can cause damage. Normally, shutting down the computer causes the disk to eject. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole.The IomegaWare software tests for the presence of the ZIP drive. It should be used in Windows 2000 to format a ZIP disk in the FAT format. Removable disks can contain a lot of data when it can be partitioned into 250 MB segments. The data on a ZIP drive can be read and written by different versions of an Operating System (using the FAT format). Rewriting reuses space, it does not increase the used space. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat (sunshine). The 250 MB ZIP disks can be read and written by a 750 MB drive. These disks use the FAT16 format so only 129 entries are allowed in its root directory. Files should be stored in folders to best use space. This also applies to memory sticks (unless they use the FAT32 format).To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
This camera is great as a starter digital camera, especially for people who are usually afraid of photography. The camera body is easy to hold and the buttons are laid out user-friendlily. It's the usual snap-and-go type, and anyone who half a brain can use the basic functions after picking it up. The memory cards have come down *a lot* in price so there's no reason to whine any more. BTW, speaking of price, the A210 can be had for under one-fifty if you shop around. For that price this is simply the best 3MP camera.Image quality is excellent outdoors when light is aplenty. Night shots do tend to be dark and noisy (noise refers to the coarse-grained color dots you see in a poorly exposed picture). But after you read the manual you can do things to improve night shots. Besides, no camera takes great picures when there's insufficient light.
If you've been waiting to get a DVD/VCR combo player at a reasonable price, this is it. The SD-V392 is nothing revolutionary, but it's a convenient player for a great price. The DVD component works very well and the VCR is exactly what you expect, no more and no less. You cannot record from commercial, copy-protected DVD movies to VHS due to copy protection, but a DVD/VCR combo is a good value if you are unwilling to go the DVD recorder route. (If you are ready for the latter, I recommend the excellent and low-priced Panasonic DMR-ES10S or ES10K, a new model line.)
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media 64MB xD Picture Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Double UPDATE - Garmin has now introduced the DC 30 dog collar + gps transmitter. It fixes many of the bugs in the old design. It uses a metal backplate behind the gps instead of plastic. The gps is black instead of orange. The antenna is longer and more flexible allowing for better range and less breakage. And since the GPS hangs DOWN by default, the new dc-30 puts a tiny GPS antenna into the dog collar itself that faces UP towards the sky. Overall it works better, in the country it adds about 2 miles to your trackign range if you are using the car mounted antenna. Those 2 miles could mean finding your dog. The new kit is sold with the DC 30 and costs about $60 more than the old model (this one) which will most likely be discontinued as my dog has broken one antenna and two plastic mounting plates. Note however that the new collar has no rings for attaching tags or leashes. This means your dog will wear 2 collars when being tracked, but gone are the days of broken parts and tracking down your GPS unit without the dog attached.Update - I ordered the car mount antenna and found the range boost phenominal. In CITY range went from .7 miles to 1.7 miles, almost the full 2 mile rating. In Country range went over 4 miles. It is the best $25 spent plus amazon's price on the accessory is heavily discounted over garmin's. If you think you may have to use your 4WD to find your dogs, start using the external antenna accessory option from the beginning.I got my Astro about a month ago and from the start the 2 mile range wasn't there (more like .33 miles maximum). I checked it with a pulse wattmeter from HP/agilent and it was outputting only 0.45 watts for .38 seconds, not the 2W rating (and the battery lasted alot longer than it was supposed to for some reason!). I shipped it to garmin, got it back and it was now putting out 2.2 watts. Range was still disappointing at 0.6 miles (city - granted - but my rino's do far better and they aren't digital!)Next, I found that there are 5 channels Astro can use of which 2 of them are used by every jobcom radio in construction etc (154.57 and 154.600 are the worst and are in use all over the place) - my unit was on one of those channels which was almost always in use, so using another RF tool (spectrum analyzer) - I found a much better channel and suddenly the in city range went up to 1.5 miles which wasn't bad.Mounting -You get 2 mounting options - a screw bracket that will mount the transmitter to the dog collar which works really well, or a velcro pocket to put the transmitter in, strap it around the dog's breast and put a tab under the dog collar to keep it upright. I tried the vest option first and when the dog came back, the whole assembly was swinging around the dog's neck (and velcro fills up with hair if your dog sheds - the gripping effectiveness goes to zero).The collar I thought would be better because the tags are always at the ground, but now the heavy part is up high. My guess was to put a lightweight fishing sinker in the dogtag strap which would keep it verticale - without that weight the dog comes back with the collar rotated sideways and the antenna horizontal, which hurts your range again.Once factory adjusted to full power, put on a clean freqency, and mounted with a counterweight it works really well - 1.5 mile range in the city and 2.0 mile range or better in the country are not uncommon. I found my dog had gone on a 5 mile chase one time from the truck.There is a problem in the few bits that garmin uses for dog status" like "treed" or "quarry", etc - when the gps has moved a bit they are meaningless so I ignore that and leave it on the doggie detail page which tells you how far away your dog is, where it is, and the battery level/gps coverage in the dog's GPS, along with the radio signal you are getting. I would have preferred "moving" or "stable", which you can get from the map if the signal reaches.You can get a nice VHF (marine type) antenna if you become car bound and unscrew the garmin antenna and connect the outdoor antenna which more than doubles range or better right away - great for end of the day searches for the dog. Both the dog and user antennas are SMA and removable unlike the rino which by law must have a permanently attached antenna unless you are good at soldering on external jacks yourself, which allows you big outdoor antennas and high power amplifiers on one radio. Dog transmitts at your programmed time interval, the handheld transmitts when only when you need to adjust the dog parameters, making it a 2way link temporarily on the AA batteries.The GPS(s) in both the dog and handheld use the highly sensitve SIRF chipset (which is dirt cheap because the entire gps is in one chip, but because of the indoor usability of it garmin sees fit to charge almost 2x more e.g. the rino520HCX is also using the sirf chipset for gps, which costs them less!) - it trades sensitivity of getting a signal for accuracy compared to their old 12 channel receiver garmin made (like putting a ford engine in a corvette). Anyways they are very sensitive, the handheld allows you to load 2GB of map data on a micro-SD card like your cellphone uses so there are alot of nice features in the set, plus you can use the handheld without any dogs.) I've put highway and topographic mapping data for the western USA, along with the entire roads CD. I have GPS mapping in my car and garmin really has a poor algorythm on this one - it will insist you drive 5 miles backwards to get on the freeway, to drive 5 miles forwards to the destination 1/4 mile ahead. It's better for 4wd or marine navigation than on-road accidents. ON-Road navigation probably is a feature to avoid.MY ONLY "STRONG" NEGATIVE is that they use 2-AA batteries in the GPS handheld. Worldwide there is a push away from disposable batteries due to price - countries like Germany and Switzerland charge more than the battery for a disposal fee - if you are caught putting them in the trash look for $500 fines. Most of europe has adopted this, hence the move to li-ion standards. I've been evaluating some 3000-3500 mah prototype AA cells in my lab from a battery company. The combination is really good - better in all cases than alkalines. I'm accustomed to the Li-ion cells on the Rino radios I use which last forever. Garmin could have fit some sort of Li-Ion pack into the battery area making it charge from both the dog charger (which is li-ion) and the dog's car-charger (included in the kit). But alas, we are stuck with kids' toys AA batteries.The waterproofness will outlast any rainstorm and the worst weather - for both you and the dog. Overall, knowing what direction and how far my dog is is great information. I have not found any geo-fencing yet which would be nice to keep your dog out of problem areas on the map like traintracks or highways.In summary you are getting 2 really sensitive GPS units (one rechargable and one AA powered) that communicate one way their location. To top off the system, Garmin gives you a nice hard case to seal it all up and keep the wet soggy stuff out of the dry stuff with a clever X strap holder on the outside of the caseBe sure to get it working good in the city before going on a hunt with it - you'll know what buttons shortcut to where, and what limitations are in the unit, and what the beeps decode to.Happy Hunting!"
This CD case is quite good. It's the binder style I like. I can actually fit 128 CDs in here and will not have to be push to close or zipped up to where the case looks like ravioli like some others by Cdprojects or Case Logic. When you open it, I like how the CD case itself doesn't pop up and come out so you have your 128 CDs and you're case when it's full. The CDs stay well put (especially if you put your booklets in front of the CD as I prefer). The nylon finish is quite nice and appealing other than some that are just one color, or look extremely weird.The downside is the binder style. I love the binder style, but it seems useless now. The first ring on the top is broken, which makes me have to use the two bottom rings, making it difficult to flip-around, and literally tearing the plastic on the left side. This also makes it hard to zip-up at times.I like how the CD case has a lot of room. I can put my CD player in here without the LCD breaking or the CD case becoming hard to zip-open.Overall, after various CD cases I've tried, this is my fav.
TDK manufactures excellent six hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes have six hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording television shows, for example.In addition, you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time, four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording. (You use your VCR to set this.) The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they're satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of viewing enjoyment because you record onto them over and over again countless times although after some use the picture quality will eventually begin to gradually deteriorate.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a DVD-R onto another DVD-R instead of a TDK blank VHS tape, the quality of the audio-visual media on the DVD-R copy would be sharper and clearer than a TDK tape or any other brand of video tape could give you. Moreover, VHS tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow front edge of each VHS tape which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The VHS tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable blank VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record. I have used this brand for many years and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend TDK premium quality six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape.
Boys and girls here is the deal. When digital cameras first came out the cards were pretty spendy. In fact, I can remember when I worked for Viking Components and the first mega promotion we did was a dollar per megabyte sale here on Amazon.com. It was wildly popular because it was a crazy low price point. Yes, that was when a 256MB CF card sold for two fifty six dollars.Now you can buy 2GB+ cards for under a hundred bucks. They are inexpensive, cheap, no cuesta mucho dinero, etc. My advise now is to buy the highest quality card you can find for under $100 and crank up the settings on your digital camera to the highest JPEG setting possible. Get the most out of your digital camera and flash card. You spent hundreds if not over a thousand bucks on your digital camera so utilize its full potential with a decent card.Personally, I prefer the SanDisk Ultra II brand now. Sure there are some personal reasons involved, but mostly they just have a really good quality product.
I searched for months for the right speakers at the right price. These are it. (You can get them cheaper elsewhere).The JBL S38 speakers are perfect for home theater, with warm mids, decent bass and crisp highs. I'm still looking for some decent stands, though. They are large for bookshelf speakers, and not light. Get the beech. They are more attractive, which is especially important if you have a wife.Ideally, I will add a JBL PB12 subwoofer at some point, but movies sound great even without a subwoofer with these babies.One warning: JBL does not honor its 5-year warranty unless bought through an AUTHORIZED online dealer. I learned this the hard way when one of the speakers' woofers blew after a few months. Also, make sure you have good quality cables (I use 12-gauge).You can check them out at Best Buy, by the way. They sound twice as good as the cheap speakers from Sony or Bose.
Verbatim makes a very reliable blank CD-R that can handle up to 700 MB of data or 80 minutes of music. Moreover, these blank CD-Rs record data at speeds up to 52x. I have used these as data discs and discs to record video. I also get very few, if any, coasters.The CD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your CD-Rs that have data stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than 52x. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your CD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the CD-R disc and compromise your data. In fact, don't write directly on these--period. You risk losing your information. Don't attach labels of any sort, either.Overall, Verbatim blank CD-R discs store data reliably and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it.
The most amazing thing about the Shuffle, bar none, is its weight. Actually, it's weightlessness. You don't know that you are wearing it. If you pick it up, it feels like a piece of plastic holding air. At .78 ounces, that's the equivalent of 20 small paper clips.The first time I held one in my hand, I knew I had to have one. Never thought I could convince my wife to spend three H's on a big iPod, and with a cell phone and a PDA already, didn't need another weighty device hanging off of me.Enter Shuffle.I've had it for the past few weeks. The lack of a screen is a small minus. Sometimes it would be nice to know what's coming next, or find a particular track. But it's easy enough to skip if you hit one you don't want to hear -- which is rare, because after all, it's your music.Sound quality is fine. Battery life is OK, too, about 10-15 hours.Now, for the quibbles. Charging the Shuffle is a pain. You have to have it plugged into a USB port. I don't know about your desktop, but mine is on the floor, and it's a pain to plug and unplug. It's no problem on the laptop. Also, it takes 4 hours to fully charge. That's weak compared to the competish. (It's like, who cares that you have USB 2.0? You could USB 0.000001 and still transfer the songs in 4 hours.) There should be a quick charge option, an adapter, or something similar. You can get a docking station, but that defeats the $99 price point. Sony's offering a similar enough player with 70 hours (!), although it's a bit heavier and doesn't work with iTunes.Transferring songs is also a pain. There are hacks using the Shuffle in disk mode -- others here or on iPod web sites can tell you how to do it -- but directly uploading songs from Shuffle to computer is made difficult as a bar (albeit a low one) to piracy. I'm sure Apple is trying to keep the record labels happy, but it should be easier.Anyway, the last few weeks I've rediscovered my music collection -- another plus of the Shuffle. Although you can set up playlists, I prefer random. I've listened to great tunes I forgot I had. Old Santana, Marley, Zeppelin and U2 mixed with a little Green Day turns my grocery shopping into a groovy concert. And I've had probably 20 people ask me what's hanging around my neck. (19 positive, 1 jerk who joked that it looked like an alarm for elderly people for when they fall and can't get up).Final thought -- get the 512, not the 1 Gig. There is no point having more music (16 hours) than battery life (12 hours) without a screen. 120 songs is just fine 99 percent of the time.Enjoy!
Better than epson cartridges! that is my opinion of the Rhinotek brand RCE9201, I have a Epson stylus photo 1280, and the quality is better than epson, and I gert more longevity out of the Rhinotek product.
I'll admit it up front: the camera watch is tons of cool, but it's expensive and you may not use it as much as you'd think. Of course, it's a watch with alarms, so at least you are not spending your hard-earned money on a gadget you would use only once every 6 months. As a watch it's pretty basic and accurate, but also pretty large, so if you have small wrists, this product will look ridiculous and ridiculously bulky on you. In other words, this is a gadget for grown men with big wrists.Of course, the reason you'd buy this product is the built-in digital camera, which sports a resolution of 120x120. This isn't much in today's world with 6 megapixel cameras, but we are not talking a professional camera here, or even a prosumer one. 120x120 is not too bad when you remember that most webcams have native resolutions of about 170x140, so this is just a bit less refined than webcams, in a package 1/5 the size or smaller. You can take up to 100 pictures, which you'd then transfer via the built-in IR to a PC. Unfortunately, you'll need to buy a separate IR sensor and upload software kit to do this, although some online shops give this away for free.How's the image quality? Obviously you have to keep your expectations reasonable. After all, this is a cool gadget, not the digital camera to bring when you go on exotic trips. You need plenty of light, I think it's rated at 100 lux minimum. You also need to learn not to move the watch when you press the shutter button, or the picture will come out blurry. It's a focus-free camera, so everything will be in focus as long as you are at least 1 foot away from the subject (or is it object?). Finally, be sure not to take pictures of people from an angle that's too low, because most of us don't look great with our chin in the most prominent part of the picture.Since it doesn't have flash, you can rule out taking pictures in a bar or club; besides, do you really want to snap the moment when you are drunk and look ridiculous? Not really, in my experience. So you'll probably use the camera only occasionally. For me, I caught a few heart-breaking moments on mine on Sept. 11, when the World Trade Center collapsed. Those blurry pictures caught the frenzy moment of a country in crisis, as well as the heroic efforts of New York's bravest and finest. Of course, you can't (and don't want to) expect to run into crises like this, so you can probably use the camera to spy on that cutie in your office (don't over do it!), or catch your friends in awkward manners (and risk losing their friendship!). Anyway, you can be creative, and that's what's ultimately cool about this gadget which you can carry everywhere, even in bed.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The PNY 256MB CompactFlash Flash Memory Card, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I was looking for a relative inexpensive camera gift for a graduating senior. While looking in a local store this Panasonic PV-GS39 camcorder caught my attention. It's got a clean, attractive styling, compact size, and the video quality looked good on a nearby TV to which it was hooked up. I've had positive experiences with Panasonic camcorders in the past -- in fact my current workhorse camcorder is the beloved VDR-D300 3CCD DVD model (see my review on Amazon). The GS39 also seems to be user-friendly, and the salesman confirmed to me that it's got better video quality than some of the more expensive models out there. The 30x optical zoom with image stabilization technology would be a boon to the gift recipient who's about to embark on a yearlong world study" tour. (Of course, we all know what young people do on such tours.) Finally, the price was definitely perfect as a graduation gift, so I bought it.BTW, buy before July 1 and get a free camcorder bag and 3 free blank tapes from Panasonic. You can get the rebate form in store or on Panasonic's website; e-mail me if you can't find the rebate link.In short, this is a terrific value and starter camcorder."
I chose to hardwire my radar detector in instead of using the factory provided curly cord deal. With this system I can use my leadfoot to mute the detector when I don't want the guy behind me to see the hand moving up to where I hid my unitAlso because I purchased the 9500ix the mute function is especially important since 3 mutes in rapid succession adds the frequency and location to your annoyance list. I chose to disable the auto list builder function and do it myself since there are so many speed traps they would add themselves to the list and be given forgiveness from further alerting after 3 passes. I can do that in a week!This cord really should be supplied with a detector at the 9500ix price point.
Lexar makes some of the best flash memory on this planet. I've owned CompactFlash and Secure Digital cards from Lexar, Sandisk as well as generics from CompUSA. By far Lexar's offerings are the most reliable, giving me 100% error-free performance. Lexar cards also appear to be faster and more power-efficient, although I haven't done any rigorous testing, just experience. (CompUSA's are the worst -- I actually lost data on their 128MB CF card!) I'm a Pocket PC freak and I load my flash memory with tons of multimedia content, so reliability and speed are important to me.In the past Lexar cards were a bit pricier than some other brands, but recently Lexar has become very competitive and many of their products are actually among the cheapest. Great quality + great value = totally recommended.Note: You should still always back up your data regularly. On the Pocket PC, use the back-up function in ActiveSync. On any device, just copy the entire content of the card to a folder in your Windows Explorer.
I had been researching on ultramobile PCs for quite a while and even looked at the Asus Eee PC, which is cheap but has a terrible low-res low-quality screen (and weighs a hefty 2 lbs, the same as my Sharp PC-MM20 *real* laptop with more memory and a 40GB hard drive). In the end I decided I'd want something no more than 1.5 lbs. and roughly pocketable.I had doubts about the VAIO UX line because, frankly, I didn't like the design, and I didn't care for the EDGE WWAN feature (I'd rather have the faster EV-DO). But when I saw one in action a few weeks ago, I decided it was good enough for me, and the price is right, so I bought one.Man, was that a good buy or what. The PC has pleased me in every way. I can now run Office 2003, Money 2008, the full version of Firefox, IE 7, and I just installed TaxACT 2007 (low-cost tax prep software). The screen is smallish but very sharp and can be very bright (I leave it at a low level to conserve battery), the keyboard quite usable, and the included port replicator makes docking at home a breeze. I hook a 7-port USB 2.0 hub to the port replicator and I now seriously plan to make this my primary PC, replacing a 3-year-old desktop.One option I'll look into is, per the advice of a poster in the product forum here, replacing the internal drive with a 100GB one. Other than that, I'm extremely, absolutely happy with a road-capable real PC that weighs only 1.2 lbs. (it actually feels lighter) that also turns into a decent desktop PC for general use.BTW, if you want an ultramobile PC definitely get something like this model which comes with Windows XP instead of Vista.
This Sandisk SDXD-512 xD card is a standard" xD card. The xD "Picture Card" flash card comes in three flavors: standard (up to 512MB), Type M (512MB, 1GB, 2GB), and Type H (512MB or 1GB). The "H" stands for "high speed" and is the latest format allowing in theory for reads and writes up to 3 times as fast as Type M cards. Interestingly, Type M xD cards are 20% slower than "standard" 256MB or 512MB xD cards. For capacity 512MB or above, you won't find any more standard xD's; you'll find only M or H ones.To see if your Fujifilm or Olympus camera is compatible with an M or H card, go to their websites and check out the compatibility charts. (Amazon doesn't allow links so I can't include them here but you can e-mail me if you can't find the compatibility charts.)Sandisk xD cards are, in general, reliable, as long as you stay with 512MB or lower. Another caveat is when you buy a Sandisk (or Fujifilm or Olympus) xD in store, be sure to get a package that's marked "Made in Japan." Only two companies actually manufacture the xD cards: Toshiba of Japan and Samsung of South Korea. Samsung cards, in my experience, have serious quality problems and *WILL* fail sooner rather than later. Toshiba ones are much more reliable; none of my Toshiba-made cards have failed even under heavy usage. Therefore, you should never trust xD cards that are marked "Made in S. Korea." Be sure to shop around until you find Toshiba ("made in Japan") cards. This tip will save you lots of precious memories and from lots of headaches later on. Unfortuantely, this verification is hard to do when you shop on Amazon or online; I can only say "good luck"! At least you have 30 days to return or exchange when you buy from Amazon."
Apple's iMac line of desktop computers are always some of the most colorful, beautiful, and respected machines in the industry. In October 2005, Apple updated the iMac G5 making them better than ever.You'll be impressed with the iMac G5, from the very moment you begin opening the box. It is beautifully and carefully packaged, and you're greeted by a message inside saying Designed by Apple in California." Then it is time to experience the performance of Apple's fastest consumer-level machine ever...Faster - The new iMac sports faster processors. This 17-inch model now has a 1.9 GHZ Power PC G5 processor, which is up, from 1.8 GHZ, on the previous base 17-inch model. Furthermore, the system's architecture is now faster, with the iMac G5 using DDR 2 memory. The iMac includes 512 MB of DDR 2 memory, and it can be upgraded, to a maximum of 2.5 GB of memory.Front Row Experience - Apple has included a new software title that at this time is only available on the iMac G5. Front Row. Front Row comes with your iMac, and a remote control is also included. Front row allows you to watch and listen to media items, on your computer, from across the room. Click one button on the remote, and bring up Front Row, for quick access to your music, movies, podcasts, DVD, and more.Built in iSight - The new iMac includes a built in iSight camera, so you can video conference with friends right out of the box. Furthermore, with the built in isight you can take advantage of another new application, available only on this imac right now, called Photobooth. Photobooth allows you to snap photos of yourself or friends, from the built-in camera and add wild effects.Appearance - The new iMac G5 is thinner than the previous model making it more beautiful than ever. This machine will stand out on your desk.Display - The iMac 17-inch features a widescreen display, which is great for watching movies and fitting items such as wide spreadsheets, or media projects, onto the screen.Hard Drive - The iMac G5 17-inch includes a big 160 gigabyte hard drive, which will allow you to store thousands of songs, pictures, and hundreds of hours of video.Mac OS X - If you're considering Macintosh for the first time, you're going to love the Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger. It is incredibly user friendly, and you'll quickly find the interface and design is saving you time. Furthermore, Mac OS X is much more secure than Windows, so you can put your mind at rest.iLife - Apple still includes iLife with every Mac. iLife is a great way to manage your personal digital life. Store and manage your digital images in iPhoto, jam to music in iTunes, create music in Garageband, and create simple movies in iMovie.Furthermore, there are convenient applications built right into the operating system such as Dashboard, iCal (a great calendar that syncs up with your external devices including iPod), Dictionary, Expose, Stickies, DVD Player, and more.Wireless - Your iMac will come standard, with an Airport Extreme card, for wireless networking. Furthermore, a bluetooth module is included, allowing you to use wireless devices, such as keyboards and mice, plus sync devices such as a mobile phone.Value - You will not find many computers available today that delivers what this iMac has at such an affordable price. A fast processor, beautiful widescreen display, wonderfully designed computer case, big hard drive, double layer DVD burner, fantastic software, and a lot more. Amazon makes it even more affordable, with great rebates.Overall, I am truly impressed by the new iMac G5. In fact, it may be one of Apple's most impressive releases, in the past couple years. The iMac delivers high end consumer performance, with features that should meet your toughest expectations. There is simply not much that cannot be done with this very capable computer. Enjoy the new iMac G5. It's a great machine."
This CD tower by Atlantic really does hold a whopping 100 CDs in their jewel cases. It is compact and it's certainly no eyesore. I use this rack to store CDs and I have been rather satisfied.Another wonderful feature of this CD storage tower is that it requires no assembly. This comes in handy for persons like me who are all thumbs." It can be stored just about anywhere, too--at 33 inches high this storage tower is compact while doing the job of storing your CDs in an orderly and presentable fashion.The rack is constructed of black wire with "cherrywood" knobs. Caution: at this price you shouldn't expect real wood knobs. The "cherrywood" knobs look somewhat like fake wood or laminate. This is a minor disappointment, however.My only complaint is that the CD jewel cases often slide to one side or the other as they rest in their slots in this storage tower. Unless you are rather careful the CDs eventually look a bit disorderly; but again this is a minor complaint and it may not bother you.Overall, if you want an inexpensive CD storage rack this is the way to go. It is affordable, requires no assembly and lasts forever. Get one and use it in good health!"
The word gorgeous applies to both the 1560V's picture quality and exterior styling. I personally prefer this black one, although you might want to check out the gray (white?) one if that's your color. Teh contrast ratio is excellent, and according to a recent PC World research report (and much to my pleasant surprise), NEC-Mitsubishi understates the contrast ratio on their LCD monitors, so you get more than what the manufacturer tells. (Apparently all the South Korean manufacturers overstate their contrast ratio, therefore shortchanging their customers this way.) Even though this is only a 15-inch LCD, the screen feels big due to the black frame. Set-up is a breeze, even for most beginners. And it stands out nicely on your desktop. I've owned another NEC LCD monitor for over 4 years and have had no problem, so I feel confident about the 1560V's quality as well. Very highly recommended. This is the one to get, unless you want the NEC-Mitsubishi 17-inch or larger LCDs. :)
The iPod first appeared four years ago, and the features continue to grow, with each update.I have owned the 60 gig iPod with video playback, for several days now, and I continue to be impressed. Its physical appearance, quality, craftsmanship, and the wide array of features, which it has are keeping me entertained!The iPod with video playback was introduced on October 13, 2005. However, one should not necessarily consider this player a video player, but a great iPod music player, with video capabilities as a fantastic bonus. Nevertheless, the iPod with video playback is the most capable and feature-rich iPod ever produced by Apple.Video Playback - The iPod plays back H264 and MPEG4 encoded video. The iPod's new display is larger than ever at 2.5 inches, giving it a resolution of 320x240. What video content can you play on your iPod? This area is limited, at least currently. You can buy music videos on iTunes at $1.99 per song, which will play beautifully on the iPod. Furthermore, Apple has made available select television shows, for download on iTunes. They cost $1.99 per episode, for titles including ABC's hits Lost and Desperate Housewives. You can also watch the episodes you purchase on your computer. If you want to put some of your own video, onto your iPod, you will need to use an application such as QuickTime Pro to convert the video to the specific requirements to play on the iPod. You can also find video podcasts, which will play on the new iPod. Even if you do not plan to view video on the new iPod, its primary purpose is to be used as the world's best music player. You can still benefit from the beautiful new display, for it will help you find your favorite music faster, and you can view the album art that accompanies your music.The video played back on the iPod looks very good. People say that you cannot enjoy video on a 2.5-inch screen, but consider it will be relatively close to your body. The video and audio provides a quality entertainment experience. I find myself excited to watch a show on my iPod, after only a couple days.Size of new iPod - Does the picture of the new iPod make it appear larger to you? Well, it did to me. The iPod looked wider, in the photos I saw. However, it is not. The height and width of the iPod are identical to the previous generation iPod with click wheel. The only change in dimensions is the depth. The new iPod is actually thinner than what came before it! Yes, even this 60 gig is thinner than the previous 20 gig photo model. What does all this mean? The iPod continues get smaller, making it even easier to carry. It feels good in your hand too.Capacity - This 60 gig iPod has room, for a lot of entertainment. With storage, for up to 15,000 songs, 25,000 photos, or 150 hours of video. The great thing I love about my 60 gig iPod is that my music, photos, and video only take up about 15 gigabytes. However, I use the additional space to backup data, from my computer. This is incredibly helpful, and could be a real saver, if something happened to your computer. See, the iPod functions as an external hard drive, so you can backup all sorts of data. Furthermore, with the video capabilities on the new iPod, you may find yourself needing the extra space that this 60 gig iPod provides.New Software Features - Apple has added features, to the new iPod besides video support. First, they have a clock feature, which quickly allows you to view the time, in up to four different time zones simultaneously. Furthermore, there is a stop watch, and a screen lock, which you can enable to keep people from snooping on your calendar and/or contacts.Battery - The battery life is one of the most important specifications that you, as an iPod user, are going to care about. This 60 gigabyte iPod sports a battery that will last up to 20 hours, when playing only music. Also note that repeatedly changing songs manually, and turning on the backlight will use up your battery considerably faster. Furthermore, the iPod's battery lasts a maximum of three hours, when playing back video. This version of the iPod no longer includes an adapter to charge the iPod, at an electrical outlet. You will have to buy that adapter separately, or always charge the iPod via USB 2.0. The charging works fine, from your computer's USB 2.0, but if you're traveling you might want the ability to charge, with the adapter. Also note that the iPod no longer supports syncing via firewire cable. You will have to use USB 2.0.Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. The iPod syncs your contacts, video, and music via the iTunes software.Podcasting - The iPod continues to support podcasting. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, for this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box. There are also video podcasts, so with the new iPod, you will be able to watch video podcasts, on the iPod's display. Video podcasts are truly a great new way, to get original new content on your video iPod.Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. The new iPod is available in a black or white finish. The black color is quickly becoming the most popular, but the white iPod is still the signature color. Do note that the black may show fingerprints and scratches more than the white iPod, much as a black car shows these blemishes more than a lighter colored car. Apple is including a small sleeve-type case, to help you protect your new iPod.Audiobooks - I'm always using my iPod, to listen to audiobooks. You can store literally hundreds of audiobooks on here that you buy from iTunes, or Audible. The iPod even has a feature that can slow down or speed up the reading of the audiobook, so that you hear it at just the right pace.Output - The iPod connects to your PC or Mac via the dock connector at the bottom of the unit. You will connect the included cable, to the computer via a USB 2.0 port. Furthermore, accessories are being made that will also connect to the bottom dock port, and you may purchase Apple's Universal iPod dock, for easy syncing to your computer. The dock (available separately) also includes s-video output, so you can show off slideshows and video, on a television. There are also iPod A/V cables available that allow composite video and audio output, for connecting your iPod to your television. This might interest you, not only to display slideshows on a television, but also to display TV shows or music videos on a television, which you purchased from iTunes.Value - For the capacity, features, and function, this 60 gigabyte iPod is a great value. 60 gigabytes allows you to store a huge amount of data, video, pictures, and of course, music. There are more features here than has ever been offered on an iPod, making it a very good value indeed.Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Enjoy your iPod experience.
I use this Belkin HDMI cable for my PS3 and Sharp 42 1080p TV. Its performance seems very good -- when using one of those so-called "demo-quality" Blu-ray movies (e.g., Kung Fu Panda), the image on my HDTV is just perfect.I opted to get this one instead of a cheaper cable, like Cables-to-go, because I was afraid that a cheaper, generic cable might not last long. In fact, one of my previous Cables-to-go cables lasted just 4 months. I hope this Belkin, which is a more established brand, will last awhile.Why not 5 stars? The cable is packaged in consumer-unfriendly clamshell hard plastic and it cut my fingers as I was opening it. When will these companies stop using such a devious packaging method?"
Other than the so-so optical zoom at 10x -- you should never pay any attention to digital zoom claims -- this new Elura is a winner. The miniscule size is definitely its strongest selling point, emphasized by stylish styling. It uses the industry-standard MiniDV tape, unlike Sony's MicroDV model which is slightly smaller but uses the faulty MicroDV format. The Elura is a carry-anywhere, shoot-anywhere camcorder that allows you to capture all the unexpected moments in life. Like other digital camcorders, the still mode is so-so, more an added bonus than a real digital camera, but as such the Elura's still mode yields good-quality photos for its resoluton rating. All in all, a worthy contender in the pocket-size camcorder arena and you won't regret the purchase.
Personally I think you should get a MiniDV digital camcorder. Namebrands like Sharp and JVC now have very inexpensive MiniDV models, so it's time to move to that format.If you really need an 8mm/Hi8 camcorder -- for example, in my case I needed one to play back my large library of 8mm tapes -- then this Sony is simply the best. It costs a bit more than a couple other Sony models as well as some offerings from lesser companies, but you get what you pay for. This Sony is not only high quality but has tons of features, such as image stabilization, NightShot, and 20x optical zoom. You can hook it up to your PC as well. You should also know that its CCD sensor is 460k pixels, more than any other model in this price range. The result is vibrant images.
Maxell manufactures excellent blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media. They may be standard grade" quality; but don't be fooled. These do a really good job recording things; and they're not that expensive. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape. These tapes are very flexible in that they have up to a total of nine hours worth of blank recording space; and this is useful when recording longer or multiple television shows, for example. You get up to nine hours of recording time if you choose the longest recording time option on your VCR recorder/player.Of course, the best image quality will be at shorter recording times (the three hour recording time gives you the best picture, some say) but many people are still satisfied with the image they get using the longer recording time speeds.Maxell blank VCR tapes also give you long life out of these blank tapes; you can use these to record things over and over again. As long as you're careful with them, the material you record should look "sharp" and in focus, too. As you may know, to preserve important recordings, just push in the tab on the narrow spine of the tape and nobody will be able to accidentally record over something that is important to you. Change your mind? Just put some tape where the tab was and you should be able to record onto the tape again.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable, blank VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you can record onto a blank VCR tape. I have used this brand for some while now on one of my two televisions; and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell three to nine hour blank VCR tapes."
The Visor NEO is practically identical to the Visor Deluxe, except it comes with a processor that is twice as fast. Because the Palm software is so efficient, that speed is rarely an issue, and you can save a bit by getting the cheaper Deluxe.All Handspring models run variations of the Palm operating system, and have all of the PALM functions people have come to know and love -- addresses, to-do lists, and access to downloadable features like Avantgo (a free service that allows you to download publications like the New York Times, CNN, Sports Illustrated onto your Palm).I've even put a free map of my county on my PDA from Mapopolis.com (a must if you haven't tried it! Streets are searchable). Also, make sure you add Vindigo, a city guide that gives restaurant and movie reviews and showtimes.The Handspring models have the best features for the money. They have a noticeably larger screen than the m105 (which I returned after a week), expandability (which I have yet to use, although I long for the GPS attachment from Magellan -- maybe when it goes on clearance?)These models only get four stars, however, because they do have two significant shortcomings.One is bulk. The low-end Deluxe and Neo are significantly larger than the Palm V, which is significantly more expensive.The PDA still fits in my chest pocket, though.Also, unlike the Palm V, 500 and 505, the Deluxe and Neo require new batteries after about two weeks of relatively heavy usage. That can amount to $20 a year or so on batteries alone. The Palm V has a lithium rechargeable, and the new Palm 500 has an even better battery, but I can't justify paying that kind of money for what is still basically, at heart, an appointment calendar.BTW, I am a newspaper reporter who previously had four Rolodexes on my desk. No longer. No longer do I misplace names, numbers, or dates. This thing has changed and organized my life in ways I didn't expect -- just ask my wife.It's basically an extension of your brain -- now isn't that worth a couple hundred smackers?
The new Canon PowerShot S500 is a 5MP upgrade to the immensely popular S400 model, which was a 4MP digital camera. The S500 produces excellent images, is easy to use, and is compact enough to carry in a pocket. 3X optical zoom is standard on these cameras. Besides shooting still photos, you can record low-res video clips as well as audio clips, but don't expect high quality on either.For a hundred bux less, you can get the 4MP S410 model which is otherwise identical to the S500. Should you go for this or the S410? I think for most consumers 4MP is plenty enough, with room for cropping and enlargements. 5MP is only necessary if you really crop a lot *and* plan to blow up the cropped images. The S410 strikes a great balance between pixel count and price -- it's a better value.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Kingston 128MB COMPACT FLASH CARD CISCO, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I bought this high-speed MSD (Memory Stick Duo) card to use with Windows Vista's ReadyBoost feature. (ReadyBoost uses a high-speed flash memory card to cache certain system files in lieu of using the hard disk, thus boosting system performance.) It works really well. I also tested its general read/write speed by copying large files as well as many small files. On my Sony VAIO laptop (with a built-in MSD reader) the speed is phenomenal.This card is also compatible with the PSP, although it does not provide any speed advantage as the PSP is happy with regular-speed MSD cards (which cost only half as much). The high speed feature can be taken advantage of in certain Sony digital cameras when it comes to continuous shooting.I have several Memory Stick and Memory Stick Duo cards and they have all been reliable and faithful.BTW, the PRO" designation in this product's name simply means it's more than 512MB. (The pre-512MB Memory Sticks carried no PRO designation.) This card is also MagicGate compatible meaning it can be used in certain Sony products that require copy protection schemes. Neither of these designations matters to most users. You can use this card safely in all Sony and other MSD-compatible devices."
UPDATE (9-2-2010) price has really dropped since I bought mine and I still have it / use it / upgraded its drive and firmware / and take it with me on trips. It now works with both my digital cam and my 32GB sdhc cards from my HD DV cam. I thought it was nice that they did not void the warantee if you opened the case to put in a larger disk later on, as I did. My only con after so long is that the DVR ability is limited with digital TV but I think that was a feature they crammed in at the last minute. My unit is still going strong. Original 2+ year old review below -->MP3 players. I've resisted buying one until they made it close to perfect. Wolverine exceeded my expectations. Here's some features I like - you might think about how you could use it, i.e. empty your digital cam's memory onto the disk inside, zoom way in to check focus, if your cam doesnt support zoom, and have an empty card ready to keep shooting.My favorite features:Removable, drop out $30 li-ion battery - keep a spare after 14 hours of songs!CF/SD/MMC/and more slots for reading memory cards AND saving photos on the hard disk80 GB hard disk is user upgradable (instructions in the manual) when big ones get cheaper (which they will - you know it!)Big, BIG screen. 320x240 but wow - it's a display in and of itself. I use it to review photos on the spot from my 8MP digicam with the tiny viewfinderVideo - well they all have video now, so that's an expectation. it's compatible with itunes, so I'm fine - but it does WMA and PC video too!Microphone built in - record conversations on the spotseparate video/audio outputs for watching video or playing photos - even with a soundtrack!Separate configuration for screen setup, hard disk timeout, and system power down times.Easy to zoom in/out on photos for focus checking - wonderful feature by itself to know your shot came out.Empties both high and low speed CF cards. My 4GB sandisk extreme III dumps to this fast, letting me keep shooting those big photos.Automatic, well organized file structure. Your last photo will be on the last folder, at the end easy to find.small built in speaker - not much but enough to verify audio transfers too.And the features go on and on - too many to list here but I may find the manual to upload.Basically - you are looking at a video MP3 player on steriods - supports universal formats, has an upgrade path, records audio on the spot, even has a video recording dock and can be setup as a TIVO. USB, 5VDC, dock ports on the bottom, ear buds included or use standard 1/8 stereo headphones with it. Uses common li-ion battery securely tucked in the handle. And with all those fetures, it's easy to use, not too big, and comes with a beltloop case. When the 200 gb disks come out, there's a button to setup one on it. No need to buy the expensive 120GB disk today.The screen color is wonderful and performance is just flawless. For example - I shoot in Olympus Raw format so I can fix things later without compression loss. This thing understands most SLR raw formats on the market today! And it's firmware is upgradable as more arrive (the factory encourages you to check for the latest version).I haven't drained the battery yet - but I've moved alot of data to it. You can use it as a USB disk as well. It also charges off the USB connector via a special cable with 2 usb plugs to snag enough power from your pc to juice it up off the USB bus.It's a winner - Comparing it to my parent's IPOD the size is close, but the functionality is far more impressive. My dad's camera uses SD cards and it cleared his card out just like my CF card - so we both can use it on trips. It even works with my micro-SD cards for my motorola phone (1GB).At 399 [2008 price] - Amazon's price is great. No shipping - prime members get it in 2 days or less (mine arrived next day for 2 day price - free) and no tax. I'm impressed - I think you will be too."
Verbatim makes a very reliable blank DVD-R that can handle up to 4.7 GB of data. Moreover, these blank DVD-Rs record data at speeds up to 16x. I have used these as data discs, discs to record video and discs to record video. I also get very few, if any, coasters.The DVD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your DVD-Rs that have data stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than 16x. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your DVD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the DVD-R disc and compromise your dataOverall, Verbatim blank DVD-R discs store data reliably and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at 16x.
It is a question that all digital camera enthusiasts ask themselves shortly after purchasing a digital camera, but it is one that is not easily answered as there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. This review will help to guide you to the best solution based off the characteristics and specifications of the Pentax Optio 450 4MP Digital Camera. I feel I am qualified to provide this information as I was in the memory industry for 7 years but having left the industry a year ago, I can be completely unbiased on this subject.One of the biggest factors to consider is the megapixel rating of this Pentax camera. Considering this particular camera is generally considered to be a 4MP digital camera. You can expect to store approximately 32 images on a 64MB card, 64 pictures on a 128MB flash card, 128 digital pictures on digital film of 256MB capacity, 256 pics on a 512MB picture card, 512 images on a 1GB media card, 1,024 photos on a 2GB flash card, and a monstrous 2,048 digital photos on a 4GB card. These image/picture calculations assume that you are going to utilize the full potential of your camera but won't shoot in RAW mode. In other words, the estimates are for shooting at the highest JPEG setting available for the Pentax Optio 450 4MP Digital Camera. Understand that they are indeed estimates and can vary based off the actual scene or subject being shot and the amount of light, color variation, detail, etc. in the photo. You can assume these numbers are accurate within 10%.However how many images a card can hold is not the only factor you should consider before buying this all important accessory. You should also consider that you may want to use your Pentax Optio 450 4MP Digital Camera to take shots of sporting events, wildlife, or even your child's unique expressions. These moments have a very small window of opportunity to get the shot you desire thus a flash card that has been rated by experts as being a faster card may be something to consider. In my opinion, it is always best to find a review of a flash card as it performed in your specific digital camera. Some cameras just work better with specific flash cards do to the software, firmware, buffer utilization, etc. between the camera and the flash card. Finding an answer to this question is not usually an easy task. There is, though, a superb website that not only offers flash card reviews but also has an extensive user forum that can answer this all important question for you. You may want to take a look at dpreview dot com and then do a search for the Pentax Optio 450 4MP Digital Camera in the forums area, if that doesn't work just do a search on Pentax and you should be able to find someone that can help you. I am fairly certain you will have plenty of information to make an informed buying decision. You may also want to look at their detailed review of this particular camera as well if you have not yet decide on whether to purchase it.Of course one of the next factors to consider is in regards to price. Please, do not make the mistake that I have made of buying the absolute cheapest flash card. Take a look at the factors I have mentioned here before you make a purchase. Think of a flash card for your Pentax camera as an extension to it. Just as you wouldn't purchase the cheapest camera case for your camera (personally I own the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack but I like the extra room and the backpack style, which may not be your cup of tea) don't necessarily purchase the cheapest flash card either. Keep in mind that you will use this card every single time you use your camera. Like I said it is truly an extension of your digital camera.The final thing I will mention is in regards to service. There are a number of flash card suppliers in the world today. However all of the flash cards are actually built by a handful (3 - 5) of companies and even those companies only have a few options (2 - 4) regarding which components they are going to use in their particular design. More or less, the actually hardware inside each flash card is going to be similar but the way in which they utilize that hardware and the level of support they will provide, given there is a problem, are more paramount. Just imagine going 10 days without a flash card for your camera (which I did) because you are waiting for some company to repair your flash card, or worse yet having it fail and having no recourse. There are a couple of manufacturers that do very well in regards to utilizing technology and providing customer service. As of the time of this writing they are SanDisk, Lexar, and Viking. However check the newsgroups and forums for the latest information as it can be very cyclical and unfortunately can take a turn for the worse overnight.No matter what flash card you decide to use with your digital camera make sure you take the time to take the pictures. Time flies by fast and having thousands of images to thumb through 5 years from now to remind you of the time that has gone by will be the most powerful investment of all. I have personally purchased a SimpleTech external hard drive to store my images on (another reason I like the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack as it gives me room to put in my hard drive). The hard drive combined with the backpack allows me to take my photos with me when I go visit family and friends. I use PhotoShop exclusively to do all my photo editing and batch processing (a great feature of PhotoShop) and of course make occasional backups to DVD-RW.Enjoy your Pentax Optio 450 4MP Digital Camera. I hope this review has informed you how this camera can be best enhanced by a flash card and the best approach in finding one that meets your specific needs.
The Panasonic VDR-D300 Palmcorder" is a compact 3CCD camcorder that records videos to mini DVDs: 3" (8 cm) DVD-RAM, DVD-RW and DVD-R. (Note that it cannot use the "plus" version of DVD+R/RW.) Thanks to the three separate 1/6" CCD image sensors inside, it shoots broadcast-quality videos and turns in decent low-light performance. It also doubles as a 3.1MP digital camera, but its forte definitely lies in shooting video.5/4/06 UPDATE: before going any further, let me offer a bit of a "warning." The fundamental differences between DVD camcorders and tape (miniDV) camcorders are two: 1) DVDs let you access a scene quickly and easily, while tapes have much faster start-up times (assuming you are already at the point where you can record or play); 2)DVD camcorders like the VDR-D300 use MPEG4 compression whereas miniDV camcorders compress much less. For most scenes you won't notice a difference. In fact you can probably shoot a good professional-looking movie on the VDR-D300. Just be aware that the MPEG4 can very occasionally raises the ugly head of heavy compression for certain shooting conditions. The "warning" concerns the DVD media: if you use DVD-RW, which is more common and cheaper than Panasonic's DVD-RAM, be prepared for up to 5 minutes of formatting time and up to 10 minutes in finalization time (both have to be done with the AC adapter attached, not from battery). In a nutshell, if you plan to do some editing, use DVD-RAM. If you plan to just shoot and watch (like me), use DVD-R or DVD-RW in Video mode (both require finalization but can be played back on almost all DVD players). I just wanted to point out the long formatting and finalization times as the biggest caveat with DVD camcorders, including the DVR-D300.Update2: if you buy this between now and 7/31, you can get a free camcorder bag and 3 DVD-R blanks from Panasonic by mail. Check their website for the PDF rebate form.Before offering my take on the VDR-D300, let me tell you why I chose it. My story might be of some help in your own decision making.First, I had always wanted a 3CCD camcorder of my own. Most consumer camcorders on the market have one image sensor inside. The image sensor is like the eye of the camcorder. The VDR-D300 has not one, but three CCD image sensors, each designed to process a specific color: red, green or blue. In fact, all professional video camcorders -- like the ones used to shoot things on TV (news, dramas, etc.) -- use the 3CCD design to better capture color. Together with proper white-balance calibration and judicious choice of lens, you get eye-pleasing colors and sharpness not found in most consumer camcorders, which tend to give dull, bland, fuzzy video images.Second, I was a little fed up with using tapes for video recording. You know the drill: you buy a tape-based camcorder, then you find out it's a pain to dub it to a VHS or a DVD, or to transfer it to a computer, so you end up using the camcorder like one or two times a year. Like many folks I have been using the video function of my digital camera a lot and left my Sony DCR-PC5 camcorder behind in the closet. My Fujifilm F10 digital camera shoots pretty good video for a camera, but for important occasions, I still want a real camcorder. (Cameras are designed for still images whereas camcorders are designed for moving pictures. For now and the foreseeable future, there's no perfect hybrid camera that does both very well.) DVD-recording has always appealed to me because I could just pop in a recordable/rewritable DVD, shoot some footage, and then play it back, without all the fussing involved with tape recording. I played with my friends' DVD camcorders (Panasonic and Sony) and really liked this "new" way of shooting videos. I waited until someone released a camcorder that combined DVD recording and the 3-chip design. Panasonic finally did, and I bought.Oh, when I was contemplating the purchase I also considered Sony's HD (high-def) camcorder, which records high-def video on MiniDV tapes. In the end, budget constraint (that one is $1500, a lot of dough for a poor guy like myself), compatibility concerns (i.e., impossible to burn HD video to DVD, not many friends having HDTV) and also the fact that I have been totally let down by the subjective quality of HDTV content on TV convinced me to stick with the standard NTSC resolution. My priority was to get a camcorder that shoots great colors and clarity, not one that gives the highest resolution. It's the same thing with buying a digital camera: higher number of megapixels doesn't necessarily mean a better picture; the camera's image sensor is just as important, if not more.OK, let's take a look at the VDR-D300 itself. (A slightly cheaper model, VDR-D250, also sports the 3CCD design and records to DVDs. It has slightly lower resolution and lacks a built-in flash and a few other features.)Whenever you evaluate a camcorder, video image quality should account for 75-80% of the composite score, because you buy a camcorder to shoot videos! Here, the D300 shines, thanks to its 3CCD design. Video quality is especially excellent when there is a lot of light. It's difficult to describe in words, but let me just say that with this camcorder, you can shoot video that looks almost like the professional stuff you see on TV: clear pictures, pleasing colors, smooth motions. Even though the D300 shoots at the same resolution as other NTSC (standard defintion TV) camcorders, its video images are very noticeably clearer and look sharper. Many consumer camcorders exhibit bleeding reds, but the D300 is largely free from this defect. I would like to point out that when I say "professional-quality eye-pleasing" colors, I don't mean high-saturation colors. Most people like warm, high-saturation colors that "jump out" of the screen. The D300's colors are rather muted when set to auto white balance. If you want to get warm colors, you'll need to manually set the white balance to achieve this effect. I personally use WarmCards from VortexMedia.com.Indoors, without professional-grade lighting rigs, the D300 turns in good performance. Definitely better than 1CCD camcorders (except probably Sony's HD camcorders), but you'll get most of the 3CCD prowess if you provide enough lighting. After all, photography and videography is 99% about lighting. Not just how much light, but the angle of light, the temperature of light (i.e., white balance), and the quality of light (i.e., diffused or concentrated). Having a 3CCD camcorder like the D300 helps improve your home video images tremendously, but if you want your video to look close to being professional, you need professional lighting techniques. For example, when shooting indoors, use a video light. You can buy a cheap one and just mount it on top of the D300 (it has a cold shoe) and turn on the video light manually. Also use the WarmCards I mentioned earlier to achieve the white balance you desire.The D300 records videos in three quality settings: XP, SP and LP. XP here means the best quality. (On some video equipment XP means eXtended Play, which equals the least quality, but not here.) You can fit about 18 minutes of video on one side of the DVD media (DVD-RAM, DVD-RW or DVD-R). SP, or Standard Play, gives you 30 minutes, but the quality is noticeably inferior. I'd never use LP (Long Play), because video quality there is worse than VHS. The battery that comes in the package lasts well over an hour of shooting with LCD on (you can also use the viewfinder only to conserve power). You can buy an extended battery that doubles the battery life.The D300 has some nifty features not found in other brands. One truly unique feature is something called AGS (auto ground-directional standby). This mysterious-sounding function automatically pauses recording when it detects the camera titled straight up or down. This is most useful when you (like I) often forget to stop the recording and end up shooting a lot of junk footage of the ground, shoes, etc. Another nice feature is optical image stabilization, which utilizes a set of small lenses to compensate for handshakes. In theory, optical image stabilization is better than the electronic type (found in Sony's products); in practice, the D300 seems to do a good job of minimizing, but not completely eliminating, handshakes.The D300 can double as a 3.1MP digital camera, but this feature is nothing to write home about. Still image quality is just okay; I defintitely prefer to use my Nikon D70 or Fujifilm F10 for photography anytime, anywhere. Pictures are recorded on an SD or mini SD card (neither included). BTW, unlike with Sony's recent offerings, you cannot record video to the SD card or capture pictures on the DVD. It doesn't matter to me at all, since I would have wanted to keep video clips and still pictures separate anyway. (You can insert a still image captured on the SD card into your video during editing.)Video editing can be done in camera, or on a computer. Both Windows and Macintosh are supported, but you definitely get more functions if you use a Windows PC. In fact, Mac users will be disappointed to know that the things they can't do with Panasonic's software, they can't do at all (i.e., no other software is compatible). In the end, it's worth keeping in mind that you buy a DVD camcorder really for its convenience; in my case, for example, I hate editing, so I'm just going to shoot, delete bad scenes, and finalize; no editing whatsoever. If you are an editing type, a miniDV camcorder will be better as all the major brands (Canon, Hitachi, JVC, Panasonic, Sony) offer comprehensive editing support for both Windows and Macintosh.Conclusion: The Panasonic VDR-D300 (along with its lesser sibling, the D250) is the first DVD camcorder that offers the 3CCD design. Having three separate image sensors for the different primary colors improves image quality tremendously. Recording to a DVD provides the videographer lots of convenience, at the expense of having fewer editing options available than with miniDV tapes. If you want the convenience of shoot-and-watch and want broadcast-quality video, the D300 is absolutely worth its price tag.I cannot fit everything I have to say here on Amazon, but you can check my blog for more comments and you can also e-mail me if you have any questions about this camcorder. Check my profile for contact info.One final note: I've seen this model advertised for much less than Amazon's price on other websites. Those websites, all run out of Brooklyn, NY, are all masters at the bait-n-switch game. I know because I'm from Brooklyn and was neighbors with these irresponsible stores. Do not believe the high ratings these sites seem to have on shopping sites; if you search on the web you'll find a lot of unhappy customers who never received what they had ordered. Go with a reputable seller like Amazon or Best Buy or Circuit City. Good luck!"
The xD Picture Card" flash card comes in three flavors: standard (up to 512MB), Type M (512MB, 1GB, 2GB), and Type H (512MB or 1GB). The "H" stands for "high speed" and is the latest format allowing in theory for reads and writes up to 3 times as fast as Type M cards. Interestingly, Type M xD cards are 20% slower than "standard" 256MB or 512MB xD cards. For capacity 512MB or above, you won't find any more standard xD's; you'll find only M or H ones.To see if your Fujifilm or Olympus camera is compatible with an M or H card, go to their websites and check out the compatibility charts. (Amazon doesn't allow links so I can't include them here but you can e-mail me if you can't find the compatibility charts.)The SanDisk 512MB "H" card, which I use in my excellent Fuji F30 camera, is quite reliable (but see caveat below). It's definitely faster than the old Sandisk 512MB "M" card I had but I doubt it's even twice as fast. The problem with xD cards greater than 256MB is both "M" and "H" cards compress data which explain the slowness relative to high-speed Secure Digital, Memory Stick Duo and Compact Flash cards. For most applications xD cards are still plenty fast; occasionally, when you shoot in continuous mode, you might experience some problems.When you buy a Sandisk (or Fujifilm or Olympus) in store, be sure to get a package that's marked "Made in Japan." Only two companies actually manufacture the xD cards: Toshiba of Japan and Samsung of South Korea. Samsung cards, in my experience, have serious quality problems and *WILL* fail sooner rather than later. Toshiba ones are much more reliable; none of my Toshiba-made cards have failed even under heavy usage. Therefore, you should never trust xD cards that are marked "Made in S. Korea." Be sure to shop around until you find Toshiba ("made in Japan") cards. This tip will save you lots of precious memories and from lots of headaches later on. Unfortuantely, this verification is hard to do when you shop on Amazon or online; I can only say "good luck"! At least you have 30 days to return or exchange when you buy from Amazon."
This Panasonic DVD-R recorder is the best way to get started on DVD recording. This is not to say this is a basic" unit. It has lots of features like time slipping. But I'm the kind of VCR users who never went beyond basic playback, recording, and programmed recording. The Panasonic is very easy to use, esp. if you already know how to use a VCR. If you want to get sophisticated, the advanced featuers are there for you to play with.What's important is the Panasonic works very well. I transfered my old VHS tapes to DVD-R, and all the discs burned without a hitch. I also record a couple TV shows on the machine, and it's never failed me. Panasonic was the first company to come out with DVD recorders and the maturity of this product means it's also reliable.Yes, this model is identical internally to the black DMR-E55K model. I personally prefer silver."
I bought this cable to connect my Playstation 3 to an HDTV set that has only DVI (I think it's DVI-I) but no HDMI. This cable works beautifully. Image quality is really good. The price just can't be beat.You should be aware that while HDMI carries both audio and video, DVI is video only, so you still need to route the audio to your TV somehow. For example, I use an optical digital audio cable to do that (together with an expensive converter box as my old HDTV set doesn't have an optical input).
I decided to upgrade my PC with Simpletech's PC133 256MB DIMM. Now I can zip through programs with many windows open and not have to worry about crashing or decreased speed. It was a simple solution to upgrade.
Verbatim makes a very reliable blank DVD-R that can handle up to 4.7 GB of data. Moreover, these blank DVD-Rs are capable of recording data at speeds up to 16x." The video I record onto these lasts and lasts. I have used these as discs to record video both with and without audio.The DVD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your record video onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your DVD-Rs that have information stored on them. Don't store these discs, used or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose your recorded video over time.There are three caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: before you buy these make sure that your DVD burner drive can burn the Verbatim brand of DVD-R without any problems; otherwise you run the risk of getting way too many coasters at best in exchange for your money. Second, there's the "recording speed" issue. When you are burning video onto a blank disc using computer software, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than "16x." This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your DVD-R completed is worth the wait.In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the DVD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--ouch! If you need to label the discs, label its jewel case using a post-it note.Overall, Verbatim blank DVD-R discs store video reliably; and if you make sure your burner can handle these they will be very useful to you. An extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at "16x" speed."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Fujifilm 64MB Secure Digital Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
This cable as an A connector on one end and a mini-B connector on the other. It works with the Sony PSP. It feels a bit cheap but the price can't be beat.
The Apollo P-2250 color inkjet printer has a beige and turquoise case whose style departs from the boxy designs of other HP printers. It comes with a guide for Setting Up Your Printer". If the "New Hardware Found" box appears click [Cancel]; you must install the software from the CD. It provides support for Windows 95, 98, and Windows NT 4.0, plus Windows 3.1x. [It also works in Windows Me.] This printer uses the #20 black and #49 tricolor cartridges. Your parallel port must be defined as "ECP". This printer will work when connected to an IOMEGA ZIP 100 drive parallel port. The 16-page "User's Guide" contains the needed information to set up the printer. There is a 49-page "Online Manual" in the installation CD.The "User's Guide" mentions the printing options on the `Features' tab: two-sided printing, orientation (portrait or landscape). The `Setup' tab will select print quality, paper size, and paper type. The printing speed depends on the complexity of the job and the print quality. You can print envelopes, index cards, and postcards (pp.4-5), and labels and transparencies (pp.6-7). Pages 8 to 10 offer suggestions when things go wrong. The buttons and lights are explained (p.11). You can remove the printer software (p.13) and replace print cartridges (p.14). The printer specifications are listed on page 15.Your electronic equipment must be protected by a surge suppressor. I use another to switch off power to the printer power supply when not in use; heat is the enemy of electronic equipment. There are warnings about the proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. The plastic tape over the nozzles of new cartridges prevents oxidation of the ink. HP seems to have a policy of "planned obsolescence" in manufacturing new printers that use new inkjet cartridges; or it may be due to progress in cartridge design. Like other HP printers the paper path takes a U-turn in printing, so less desk space is needed. HP does not recommend refilling these cartridges."

If you are attracted to the Coolpix 5700 by the attractive price, you should keep in mind that this SLR-type digital camera first came out 2.5 years ago, which in digital photography chronology was more like the days when the dinosaurs roamed the earth.The 5700 is by no means an incapable camera. It has 5 megapixels, 8x optical zoom (which gives a range of 35-280 in 35mm equivalent), a swivel LCD screen, and electronic viewfinder (EVF). EVF shows you what the lens sees, so this is an SLR-type camera, except the lens cannot be changed. The built-in Nikkor lens is actually very high-quality and is designated ED by Nikon: the ED stands for extra-low dispersion, refering to the high-quality glass used to make the lens.The lens, in fact, is the best part of the 5700 at the after-rebate price: if you want to get a professional-quality zoom lens for a low, low price, the 5700 gives you a lot of bang for the buck, so you are basically getting a capable 5MP digital camera for free. On the other hand, the 5700 is showing its age in other departments: auto-focus capability (esp. problematic in low light situations), processing speed, shutter lag, etc. More recent models such as the Coolpix 8400, 8700 and 8800 have better functions and are better supported by Nikon, and also have better picture quality plus more pixels. (Remember: pixel count does not equal picture quality, just like hard drive capacity has nothing to do how fast a computer is.)In summary, while the 5700 was top-of-the-class two years ago when I first played with it -- and its professional zoom lens is fantastic -- it's showing its age as a digital camera and is effectively a discontinued model. If you want an SLR-type digital camera, consider the newer Coolpix 8400, 8700 and 8800 or the latest G-series from Canon or other similar cameras from Fujifilm or Konica Minolta.On the other hand, for semi-serious photography without spending too much money, the after-rebate 5700 makes a terrific value.
Well, I needed some new headphones. I tried the UR5 from Koss. The sound quality was alright, but they could BARELY be heard. I found these, thinking Sony, would make headphones with better and louder sound. I was right.The good news is that the sound quality is excellent. Sony headphones always seem to have more punch than other Koss, RCA, Panasonic, and other brands of headphones. The bass and treble are clear, and bass is pretty deep as other $6 headphones I've tried. I would have enjoyed the headphones that came with my player (SLSV570), but they were uncomfortable, and I mean VERY. These are pretty comfortable and lightweight, as the box explains.The bad news is the overall durability of these headphones, which is a big minus. I've been though two of these, yet the third ones haven't broken yet at all (keeping my fingers crossed).The price is very reasonable and very cheap, and I wouldn't have a problem buying another pair, because of their cheapness.Overall, these headphones add a punch to your music, and the volume is loud for those quiet CD players.
People often ask why they would need a relay on a zone expander and the reason is simple. If you are monitoring only burg inputs (doors, PIR detectors, window switches) you do not need a relay. But put just ONE wired smoke alarm on the expander and you need to interrupt voltage to the alarm if it goes off to clear and reset the zone (the fire department will insist on this should a detector trigger). All wired detectors are setup to clear their status by interrupting power, which is done here with the relay under command from your panel on the clear smoke alarm" signal. If your home has 5 bedrooms, a garage, and a living area you could have 7 smoke detectors to meet code. This expansion unit gives you a clean method to include those smoke sensors without a problem when one is activated.Hint: Wire the power lead to the smokes through the normally closed position on the relay to save power and interrupt it from the panel when clearing the smoke alarms. The relays draw an extra 70mA when energized."
IOMEGA ZIP 100 Portable USB DriveThis unit is identified by its translucent light blue rectangular box. It uses a separate power supply. The Model Number is ZIP100USB. It can operate either horizontally or vertically (like a floppy drive). A device that connects with a USB cable requires Windows 98 or later. You should use the software EJECT command to remove a ZIP disk in Windows 2000 because the disk caching system may have data that needs to be written out. The IOMEGA software should be installed in Windows 2000 instead of the built-in support.The User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details.Computers have a limited number of IDE devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical. Replaceable 100 MB ZIP disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology. But the 100 MB ZIP disk is almost as universal as the floppy disk when you have a parallel port drive for older systems. The ZIP disks reuse deleted space unlike a CD whose space is consumed when you replace files. Falling prices for CD discs solved that problem. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
While this model is eminently capable, it is essentially going to be replaced by the nearly identical Visor Neo. Maybe there will be some last-minute price cuts to clear inventory. As for the product itself, the Visors are very capable Palm OS handhelds, highlighted by a full-size screen and an expansion slot (which I have yet to use, but you can add everything from a cell phone to GPS). This model and the Neo have faster processors compared to the Visor Deluxe, but that's not that big a deal because the Palm OS is so efficient. Batteries last a long time, usually at least two weeks.One issue with the Visors are that they are bulky compared to most other Palm devices (although smaller than Pocket PCs), although they still fit in your shirt pocket. The pricy Visor Edge doesn't seem worth the money on the high end.Someone wanting a full-featured Palm without needing expansion options should get the Palm Vx, which sports a lithium rechargeable battery, an extremely small and svelte shape, and fits into your hand in an ergonomically perfect manner. But that would add a good deal to the cost, so it's your call.

I have several olympus bodies that share this battery, so I am constantly cycling them through the charger. My E3 and E300 both have the dual battery adapter which helps to charge the flash faster, so they use 2 of this item instead of 1.At the price, you cant beat it. I've trusted lenmar before, and I've fully discharged and charged my set of these without any problems whatsoever. They are identical electrically to the olympus packs, but don't set you back so far in money.This allows me to keep all my cameras/lenses ready to go with a hot battery and do it at a reasonable price. Oly wants way too much for their blm1 battery pack, considering most photographers will have the 2 battery adapter!

These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available. A 2000MB card should be an investment. You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity. Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted. Then what do you do? Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
No, the SD10 is not perfect. For one thing, it could use some optical zoom. There is *always* a situation that arises when you do need to zoom in just a little bit. Digital zoom never does it for me. So Canon, please add optical zoom (even if a paltry 2x) and this will be a 10-out-of-five camera!That said, the SD10 is perfect for the snap-happy. Count yours truly as one. It's a take-anywhere-snap-anywhere-view-anywhere-hide-anywhere kind of camera. The four megapixels are nice, and the picture quality is nothing short of astonishing, at this super compact size or at any size. BTW, the number of pixels usually does not translate directly into picture quality, just as a CPU's megahertz rating doesn't correlate directly with a system's overall speed. But Canon engineers are a bunch of smart monkeys, indeed, and every Canon digital camera out in the last three years has just been totally fabulous in the picture quality department.What makes a digital picture top-quality? The colors have to be natural-looking and balanced, preferably both indoors and outdoors. There shouldn't be any digitized artifacts (like glowing edges of your new kitchen knife or pixelated pimples on your kid's face). The white should be white and the black black. Above all, one look at the picture and you go, wow, this is one nice shot!" (assuming it's meant to be one nice shot). The SD10, happily, delivers in all these aspects. One could wish for a longer flash range, but, alas, that's why serious photographers like me have to keep an old-style SLR film baby around with a hotshoe on it. If you want serious flash, man, you have to use an external flash. The SD10 does well what it was designed to do.I really don't want to talk to you about the tech specs. They are meaningless in the real world anyway. To sum it up, the SD10 is a camera you'll be happy with and you'll probably fall in love with -- a gadget freak like yourself likes all nice gadgets but we don't fall in love easily, but the SD10 deserves to be loved. If you are anything more than a casual photographer, I recommend you *also* buy a "more serious" model like the Canon S410 or Minolta Xg which has more controls and does come with optical zoom, and use the SD10 as a candid shooter. But, seriously, this is a great camera for all kinds of photographers -- and gadget freaks."
I bought these earbuds for my CD player (at the time) because the ones I had before died on the right side. They were a pair of RCA behind the neck headphones I bought at Family Dollar for very cheap. I would buy another pair but now I have an iPod and want to buy mostly earbuds and clip headphones that are more portable. I was planning on buying a pair of Philips earbuds at Target because (I thought) these were dead on the right side and I dislike the iPod earbuds, but when I plugged these into my iPod they worked fine. After a break-in session they sound even better.Well, they are only ten bucks, so what can you expect? Not a ton, not a surround soundstage and great, powerful sound, but maybe something that has at least average sound, are comfortable, and will last a decent amount of time. And thatt's mostly what I got with these earbuds.They don't have stellar sound (that for some reason a ton of reviews rave about), but they have decent sound that's good enough for the money. Not a lot of bass, but some pairs at this price have barely any bass. The mids on this pair are emphazised (but not by a lot, props to Sony). And they do have a good, clean sound to them, so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper end.For other aspects of the earbuds, they are very comfortable and fit much better than the Apple earbuds, but feel better with the pads. I have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time. Also, these are some durable headphones so far, and after a half-year of use they still put up nicely.Overall, not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables. Already got a better pair? Keep these for some useful back-ups. They don't have amazing sound, but are comfortable and last long enough to make them worth the price. 4 stars.NOTE: This is a waterproof version of the MDRE828LP earbuds. These would be a better deal if you are using them mostly outdoors.
This memory card is soooooo much better than the 64MB. My computer runs so much faster and I can put more programs into my computer. The only problem is that I couldn't transfer data from my old 64MB card. It's like owning a brand new computer!
IOMEGA ZIP 100 InternalThis internal ATAPI drive is the fastest access to a replaceable ZIP 100 disk compared to a drive that connects to the parallel port, even when the Parallel Port Accelerator program is used to optimize data transfer. The external drive that uses a USB connection is the next best thing. The `User's Manual' recommends watching the Video Tutorial before installing the hardware. Read the instructions and take notes if you never did this before. The ZIP drive is always installed on the secondary IDE channel, never the same IDE channel used for the hard drive. The CD drive is usually the master or first drive, the ZIP drive should be the secondary or slave drive. You are limited to a single IDE ZIP drive on a computer.NEVER insert a ZIP disk into a drive unless the power is on, as this can damage the drive. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole in the back (p.26). CD drives have their emergency eject hole on the front panel, a better location. Once the drive is installed correctly turn on power and then you can install the IomegaWare software from the CD. Follow the instructions on the screen. Use the applications to format, copy, and protect your ZIP disks. Or you can download the software from the Iomega web site. Use the Copy Machine application to duplicate a ZIP disk (p.28). You can format a ZIP disk with the Iomega Format, or run applications from a ZIP disk (p.29). You can both Read and Write Protect your ZIP disks (p.30). The three jumper settings are explained on pages 32 and 33. The last section is for Troubleshooting and has answers for possible problems.Iomega recommends installing IomegaWare applications in Windows 2000 to format ZIP disks so they will be compatible with other Windows operating systems. If a ZIP disk is formatted in NTFS it can lock the disk so the eject button on the device does not work. You should always choose the software eject command because of disk caching in Windows 2000 and XP. The ZIP 100 disk provides unlimited storage space within its 100 MB limit. Space on a ZIP drive is reused when files are replaced or deleted. Only a ZIP 100 drive can do a Long Format on a ZIP 100 disk. This can correct disk errors or remove protection from files. The 250MB drive can read and write 100MB disks, the 750MB drive can only read 100MB disks. The 100MB drive can not process the larger capacity disks.This Z100ATAPI model comes in a 5.25 bracket, four bolts, spare jumper, IDE cable, and a power cable connector. The drive can also fit in a 3.5" bay. The 100MB disk is practical in downloading software from the Internet to take home, or other large files for transportation. But newer computers no longer include a ZIP 100 internal drive as an option.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
Memorex makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust. The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves!The colors are red, blue, green, yellow, and orange; this is great for color coding the different types of disc media you have in your collection. Moreover, the colors don't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the CD or DVD. I agree with the reviewer who notes that there is a hole in the back of the sleeve into which you can insert a flap. This ensures that the CDs and DVDs don't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another.They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room.Some reviewers noticed an unpleasant smell from these sleeves but my order cam quite satisfactorily. I feel badly that they had this bad experience; it may be that Memorex improved the way they manufacture these sleeves so that they won't smell bad.Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price. I highly recommend these CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical and cost-efficient alternative to jewel cases.
First, let me state, I did not BUY this, it was GIVEN to me along with a TV monitor and some satellite uplink gear, so the person who owned it before me may have had a more pressing need. All of my TV gear is backed up behind a 3KW APC UPS with an external 48VDC battery array.Having said that, the 5100 does do some nice things. OUTLETS. Lots of them. Error lights for over/under voltage. Current display in big LED digits. I do like the unit having used it for a while now, but I do not turn off my TV, so I forgoe most of the features.I do like the ampmeter that tells you how much currrent you are presently pulling. Regretably they do not have a wattmeter as well. Families with children might like to have a dollar meter as a feature too.All in all it is very well built and yes, I did take it apart before using it. Is it worth the ~400 price tag? I don't think so personally - but to some people who have invested thousands into their home theater, it's cheap and a good tool. If you have a TV/DVD/Satellite setup it's certainly not the centerpiece of your system.Would I *BUY* it? No. Do I like it? Yes. Perhaps if I move it into my home theater room I might like it more then. For now, it's a power strip on steroids with a few handy features ironically used for my computer equipment more than the A/V gear.I hope that helps. One last comment - every outlet is noise protected and isolated from the others, which in an analog world is an important feature. In today's digital reception, it is not a real useful tool.
I've had the chance to try out HP's attempt at a consumer-friendly Pocket PC, and they have a winner. Nearly as small and just as light as a Palm V, HP has packed a top-notch screen and almost all of the functionality you could possibly want into a handsome 4 oz. piece of electronics.Some thoughts:* The battery doesn't last as long as Palm's, and you'll probably want to charge it at least every other day, every day if you use it extensively. You can get an extra battery, since the HP's is removable -- a real advantage in the long run, since you won't have to send the unit in for servicing a la the Palm and most other PDA models.* You want MP3s, you got 'em. Add a 256MB SD card, and you're off and running. The unit does contain an annoying headphone adapter jack, but such are the tradeoffs of small size PDAs (Palm has a similar issue on the similarly priced Tungsten E.) It's not an iPod, but it'll do.* You can also display small videos and pics, of course, but who really needs/wants to do this on a regular basis? I suppose if you are one of those annoying people who want to show everybody your latest baby photos, this will be just the ticket.* There is no wireless functionality out of the box. You can add it later, but if you really are looking for Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, you probably want a PDA with those features built in. That'll cost you, of course.* Is there such a thing as too small? The buttons on this Pocket PC take a bit getting used to compared to the large and in charge buttons on the older, bloated iPaqs of yesteryear.* Why so chintzy on the warranty? 90 days?! Take it from me, PDAs break. Their screens can crack, units freeze up, buttons stick -- basically, bad stuff happens. Seems like HP is trying to force folks to upgrade to the extended warranty. That is unacceptable support from one of the world's largest companies, and costs this otherwise excellent unit a star. (Palm offers 1 year, and I personally had near-instant turnaround on a Palm Vx repair)...
Sony calls this new line of flash-based, coin-like (but they are thick coins!) MP3/ATRACT players the Psycs, and their new-age styling does psyc you out. Which is not a bad thing, as they are more euro-cool than the rather bland and boring iPod and the downright butt-ugly iRiver. The more I look at the Psyc, the more I like its looks.The new Psyc MP3 player features 512MB of flash memory, which is great for those of you jogger jocks out there. You can shake this thing violently and it won't skip a beat, unlike those hard drive-based players. Before you insert an AAA battery, the Psyc weighs in at an amazingly light 0.9 oz. -- that's right, folks, it's less than an ounce! With the AAA battery, my guess is it's about 2 oz. It's very small although, relatively speaking, it looks a little thick. (About 0.75 in. at its thickest part.)What, you ask, it uses an AAA battery? Yes my friend, and this one AAA alkaline battery can power the player up to 70 hours! That's almost three full days of continuous playing. The phrase up to" here means that in order to get all 70 hours of playing, you must 1) play ATRAC3Plus songs encoded at 48kbps and 2) do not press buttons or do random play (i.e., just leave the player playing sequentially). In the real life we like to skip a song, fast forward, random play (a.k.a. shuffle play), turn it on and off and on and off, and most importantly, we play MP3 songs. All these operations reduce the battery life. Given my experience with previous Sony MP3 players, my estimate is one good AAA battery should last you 40 hours or more. (With my beloved Sony NW-HD3, I routinely get the advertised battery life of 30 hours even when playing MP3 files.)Of course, the use of AAA means you get an abundant and ready supply of cheap power source, and you can trek in the Amazon for weeks on end without having to worry about finding an AC outlet.The Psyc, which comes in three colors (green and blue for the 512MB version, and orange for the 256MB version), has a nice backlit LCD screen, so you always know what you are playing as opposed to having to guess as on some other certain MP3 player. It plays MP3 as well as Sony's ATRAC songs. If you are an ATRAC fan you'll like the sound quality of this little player; it's at least as good as Sony's MD players. For MP3's, the sound quality is a bit "muffled" compared to my NW-HD3 20GB player, but still quite good if you pair it with a good pair of headphones (i.e., ditch the stock earphones).Sony still has a long, long way to go in the user interface department, as this has always been its weakness, whether it's digital music or digital video or anything else. The Psyc is not hard to use; its basic functions are no-brainers. But, for anything beyond play/pause/skip, its interface, whether on the unit itself or on the PC transfer side, is still not polished and was clearly designed for a Japanese audience -- Japanese consumers reportedly love to play with complicated gadgets; no surprise given how elaborate sushi-making and origami are. We American consumers like things that are elegant and simple, and Sony has a lot of room for improvement in this regard.In short, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the new Psyc flash-based MP3 players. They are stylish and lightweight and lasts forever on cheap AAA batteries. They have good sound quality and are priced right. Just be prepared to spend some time with the manual and experimenting a little. If you are stuck, you are welcome to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail with your questions."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The PNY E-Commerce 64MB SECURE DIGITAL CARD INTL, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

This is a 2-meter Male/Female dual-link DVD-D cable. It's cheap and definitely is not of the same build quality as Monster Cables but its performance is pretty good. I recommend this unless you absolutely want to pay an arm and a leg for a DVI cable.Remember, this is a male-female cable. Most people need a male-male cable.
Well, the other guys are all complaining about Amazon's shipping charge. Amazon's free shipping for over $25" offer comes and goes, so if you see it in effect -- it is as of today (10/12/2005) -- grab whatever you need. As for buying the ink tanks, just buy all three colors in the set at the same time to qualify.Anyway, let me talk about the ink tanks themselves. The three "BCI-6" ink tanks work in the Canon Pixma iP3000 printer. (Maybe in other models as well, but I have the iP3000.) These are official Canon ink tanks so you'll know they'll work well. The number of prints you get heavily depends on your printing habit, e.g., what you print, how much you print, and at what quality you print.Using my usage as an example. I print at Normal Quality most of the time, and I print about 50% photos (at 200 or 300 dpi, depending on needs) and 50% web pages (e.g., flight confirmations, Hotmail messages, etc.). I don't print Word text documents much. I've run through 2 sets of ink tanks, and my very rough estimate is each set has lasted about 250-300 8.5"x11" sheets. Maybe more, but I don't wish to raise your expectations too much. Suffice it to say that of all the inkjet printers I've owned -- photo or not -- the iP3000 has a terrific ink capacity record. Of course, if you use one color more than the others, that particular ink tank (or ink tank combinations) will go out faster.(For your reference, a few months ago I read in a magazine review the the average per letter-size print cost of the iP3000 came out to around 12 cents per page on plain paper, one of the lowest average costs for inkjets. Not sure what settings they used in their tests or how much they paid for ink tanks, though.)In case you are interested... the new Canon iP4200 model employs a new formula of ink which supposedly will not fade for at least 30 years. My own take is, no matter how you print your photos -- even at professional photo labs -- a photo print will eventually fade if exposed to light. It's just a simple law of chemistry. So be sure to archive your digital photos on CDs or DVDs so 30 or 40 years from now, you can still print fresh copies and relive your treasured memories in their full colors."
I rarely buy refurbished products, but when I saw this Sharp 20 LCD TV on Amazon selling for a good price, I bought it for my bedroom. I've had it for the last few days and am *very* happy with the purchase.The TV arrived in a plain Sharp refurnished equipment box. It was well packed -- and even though I accidentally dropped the box on the floor while carrying it to my bedroom, the TV was totally unscathed. When I took out the TV, I couldn't tell it was a refurbished unit at all. Everything was shiny and new. I immediately hooked it up and turned it on. Not a single dead pixel.What really impressed me right away was the clear and bright picture I was getting. I hooked up my Panasonic DVD player (to the TV's composite video input) and popped in "Basic Instinct 2," which I had just received from Netflix. The movie looked beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised that a "small" screen like this could display such high-quality pictures. It was still light outside, and I had to turn the Backlight setting to "dark" because the "normal" backlight was too bright for me.This Sharp, like the higher-end Sharp AQUOS line (the best in LCD TV!), has terrific viewing angles from all sides. Horizontally, the viewing able is at least 170 degrees, so you'll see perfect picture quality even if you view it from a steep side angle. Top and bottom viewing angles are a bit less but still quite wide. Because I sit low in bed to watch TV, my line of view is at about 30 degrees from the LCD surface -- and the picture looks great (a bit darker than head-on, but that's no probelm for me at all as I find the LCD already too bright for my taste). Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the widescreen version of "Basic Instinct 2" on this 4:3 NTSC set.In short, this Sharp 20" LCD TV is an excellent standard-definition set. It also accommodates progressive-scan component video input but I haven't tried that yet. (The manual does mention that the set won't accept HDTV signal.) It's stylish-looking, easy to use, and has excellent image quality. At the remanufactured price, it's the best steal on earth.(Obviously I haven't had this long enough to know its reliability, given it's remanufactured. My other Sharp products -- laptop, TVs, other electronics -- are very reliable, so I hope this will last a long time, too. I'll update this review if anything happens in the next couple years.)"
The sound is surprisingly good, if not quite hi fi, and the unit is small enough to throw in your luggage. You can use it to replace your tinny laptop speakers with the right cord. It doesn't work on batteries, though. My only real complain: you have to be a bit careful: the ipod can move on the connector, possibly damaging the dock and ipod.
These remotes are serialized with unique serial numbers on each of the 4 buttons - this prevents copying of the keyfob. It comes with adhesive stickers to customize it or you can use the default factory labels. Ademco also makes a 12V switch that stands alone and works with one button you choose on the keyfob - you must enroll the serial number of the keyfob buttons you want to use into the switch but it has relay outputs for activating gates, garage door openers, or other purposes.It can simultaneously be used as a remote for your home alarm system and your gates or garage door opener. I like it because I can open my gate with my key ring when I am outside walking my dog - it normally opens with a garage door opener but if I am not in my car I can use a spare button on the keyfob to open it.
The AT&T; 1738 answering machine gives you a lot for your money! I have had this a while now and I don't regret my purchase. Yes, sometimes the message (both outgoing and incoming) playback sounds slightly too slow or too fast; but the playback is still clear and the messages people leave you are perfectly understandable.This machine attaches easily to your phone and the electrical outlet. The feature setup requires your attention; but if you do it right (which takes about ten minutes--fifteen tops) you'll be glad you did. This answering machine lets you choose voice prompts in either English or Spanish; and you can choose an easy to remember remote access code so you can pick up your messages without being home. The clock is easy to set up and the time date stamp is useful for time sensitive messages. You can also choose whether or not to have the system pick up blocked phone calls. There's much more, too. Great!The machine also takes up very little space (maybe 6 inches by 4 or 5 inches tops); and the digital features means that there's no small cassette tape to replace ever.Personally I've never had a problem with this telephone answering machine. The worst that ever happened to me is that after a power outage I had to reset the clock. It takes five minutes with the easy to understand directions booklet that comes with this machine. The booklet also gives you a website to go to if you have any questions. I searched through the booklet but I could not find a phone number for customer service.Overall, I highly recommend this answering machine. With 40 minutes of digital messaging capacity you really can't go wrong; and AT&T; is still a very good brand for this type of answering machine.
There are so many progressive-scan DVD players out there nowadays -- with some costing less than $35 -- one must wonder what's the point of spending more than $100 on a DVD player. The answer, not surprisingly, is you get what you pay for.In the case of the Panasonic DVD-S97 DVD player, you are getting every penny's worth, if your goal is to get the best possible picture quality out of DVD movies. Of course, if you are still using a standard analog TV, you won't see the kind of high quality we HDTV owners do. To get the max out of the player, you need an HDMI-capable HDTV monitor and need an HDMI cable. The all-digital connection does two things: 1) transmit the video (and audio) signal in digital, and 2) allows the Panasonic's upconverter to work.The upconverter basically converts the NTSC resolution on today's DVDs to HDTV resolution. It's pretty much like digital zoom on your digital camera. Does it work? Surprisingly, it does in many cases. At least it will not degrade your picture quality (unless you have the expensive but poor-quality Samsung HD841 which amazingly manages to *degrade* video quality). The Panasonic is a consistent performer that helps you take advantage of your HDTV monitor... until the day HD DVD arrives.The Panasonic is solidly built and easy to operate. Its superb video output is what makes it a five-star DVD player that's also very affordable.
This is a pretty good music. It moves smoothly around my computer desk as I click on stuff, and the ball under the mouse is soft as well. I don't know what they mean by 4D". This mouse has nothing near 4D. It's just a basic mouse with scroll. If you just want a basic mouse without wireless or laser features, get it. It's a great buy for under $15. Installation was a breeze, though the software only has a few options (remember, I said basic mouse). Anyway, I would recommend this mouse for people not looking for much features, and/or have a tight budget. Go buy it today!"
As with all adaptec cards, you can expect quality LVD scsi interfaces at a reasonable cost. This card has 2 connectors, a micro parallel scsi externally and a normal sized 68 pin scsi inside the case. It also includes a low profile bracket to use with servers.There are two versions of this card - in this version you save $50 but don't get any scsi cables. If you already have scsi cables around it's the cheapest way to add scsi to a modern motherboard and use one of those tiny X1 slots.A cautionary note - windows server 2003 (32 or 64 bit) is the last version that supports byte sequential backup devices - e.g. tape. Once you go to vista backups will be disc to disc, and given the high price of quantum drives for terrabyte storage its cheaper to buy more drives than to write to tape. Even the fastest drives move about 1/2 TB per hour to tape so you may be better off in vista backing up to a removable drive system instead of tape.Also you must download the 64 bit drivers from adaptec at the time you install the card. I had no problems putting a DLT drive on a quad core windows server 2003 system with this card using my exiting cable.
I was very impressed with Simpletech's Bonzai 64 MB. It's small,yet powerful. It is as simple as just inserting it into any USB port and, you have a small, portable disk drive. Really invaluable for transporting files between work and home without the expense and mess of having zip drives on each system or carting around a bulky storage device. Even better for transporting files between Windows and Macintosh computers. No new software to learn once its inserted it just shows up on your system as another disk drive. They should of come up with this sooner.

Totally pleased with the timely fashion my order was handled and received. I would abosolutely make a future purchase!!!
The other reviews have said enough about the cool features and good image quality of this entry-level digital camera. I just want to emphasize its excellent quality. My family has a total of three digital cameras by Canon and also a Rebel SLR bought years ago, and all exhibit the highest level of quality control. You can't go wrong with a Canon.
I think this highly affordable speaker system is quite good, especially this great price. It would have been a good set for double the price. Sure this is no audiophile system; but to get that kind of pure" sound you'd have spent no less than $1,000. For most home theaters this 650-watt system is totally good enough. Remember: how you place the surround speakers often have a major impact on the sound quality."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Smart Modular 64MB SD CARD COMPAQ IPAQ-3800 SERIES, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
TDK makes a very reliable blank DVD-R that can handle up to 4.7 GB of data. Moreover, these blank DVD-Rs are capable of recording data at speeds up to 16x." The video I record onto these lasts forever. I have used these as discs to record video both with and without audio.The DVD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your record video onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your DVD-Rs that have information stored on them. Don't store these discs, used or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose your recorded video over time.There are three caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: before you buy these make sure that your DVD burner drive can burn the TDK brand of DVD-R without any problems; otherwise you run the risk of getting way too many coasters at best in exchange for your money. Second, there's the "recording speed" issue. When you are burning the video onto the blank disc using computer software, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than "16x." This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your DVD-R completed is worth the wait.In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the DVD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--ouch! If you need to label the discs, label its jewel case using a post-it note.Overall, TDK blank DVD-R discs store video reliably over the years and I believe that if you make sure your burner can handle these they will be very useful to you. An extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at "16x" speed."
I bought the Lexar 1GB 40x CF card to use in my Nikon D70 digital SLR camera. Originally I had a 256MB CF card but that one would not support high-speed write so I couldn't take full advantage of Nikon's 3fps continuous mode. The Lexar 40x CF card simply works, and now I can shoot burst pics at the D70's 3fps speed without any problems.I have always liked Lexar's flash memory products, as I've never had a single problem with the dozen of them I've owned (CF, SD, MS). Lexar's cards are also compatible with a wider range of products than Sandisk or Viking. The only other flash brand I totally trust is Panasonic, but they only make SD these days.If you have a digital SLR the 40x speed should be enough. I don't know of any current d-SLR that really takes advantage of anything higher than 6mbps.
Hey - it's a great NTSC buffer amplifier - does what it says - but it does much more.If you ever need to fan out that digital audio signal (the RCA or fiber - in this case only the rca connector works), well guess what - it looks like a video signal enough that this device will fan out the audio to multiple displays.I'm not going to go into the electronics behind it but basically the audio signal fits inside the width of a video signal. All this device does is make 4 isolated coppies of one input signal to redistribute. Works fine for digital ac3 audio just like digital.Only problem is you need 12 volts - if you have a pc nearby you can get 12 volts to run it from the pc's power supply - for me i'm replicating my pc's digital audio out to multiple sources so it was a no brainer.neat undocumented use for a plain jane product!
I've been a fan of the Dimage X series since the first Dimage X was released almost 2 years ago. These are just wonderful cameras that take good pictures, sport an ingenius periscope-like optical zoom system, and are totally hip and useful. The Xt is a bit hard to find on the street as it's new. Internally it's pretty much the same specs as the previous model, the Xi, but it's slightly more compact. Is that a big deal? Well, yes, how could you have asked? The smaller, the better! At least that's the belief of these smart nerdy Japanese engineers. If you have big hands I'd recommend a larger Minolta model like the F series, or a Canon or Nikon or Kodak. But if you just want cute take-anywhere cameras, the Xt is PERFECT. The Casio Exilim may have a cooler form factor, but the Exilim doesn't come with optical zoom so is best for very casual photography like when you feel bored on a subway or bus and want to take pictures of city scenes. The Xt has more uses. For one thing, it's just great for travel photography (as long as you don't need 300mm zoom for Safari pictures). With the release of the Xt, Minolta is now a serious contender in the consumer digital camera field and I think they represent a better value than Canon, my previous favorite brand.
Unlike some lesser brandnames, this Panasonic DVD recorder actually works. I've heard that with some other brands, you can get failed burning sessions, which would waste your blank DVD media. Also, since this Panasonic uses the DVD-R (&quot;dash&quot; or &quot;minus&quot; format) instead of DVD+R (&quot;plus&quot; format), the discs you burn are compatible with *more* DVD players. For my money, I'd stick with DVD-R all the way. Also, be sure to get high-quality blank discs for better recording quality and longer shelf lives.(Ignore the DVD-RAM format. No DVD player I know of except some Panasonic models can read DVD-RAM.)I'm really happy with the great build quality and great price I got with this model. I didn't need one of those Panasonic models with a built-in hard drive, so I saved money. But if you want TiVo-like capabilities, check out those HD-equipped models.The best virtue of this Panasonic is it does a great job at what it's supposed to do. I'm sure better models are already in the channel, so I'd say if you can wait a bit longer, wait a bit longer. Otherwise, the Panasonic is your best bet for value, quality, and durability.
The bci-6 series from Rhinotek which is compatable for the canon bci-6 cartridges worked in my printer better than the canon bci-6 that I was previously using. the quality was good without any changes by my part, after tweaking the printing properties for my printer and changing the way that the color printed, it became a fantastic cartridge set.
GE Digital Messaging System 29875This answering machine has flexible options set by its buttons on top of the machine. The User's Guide" has the instructions in English and Spanish. The telephone line cord is non-removable, so this unit must be near the modular wall jack. It can record incoming messages without a connected telephone. You can access this device via a telephone call to record or play messages, turn the system on or off, and record a message or greeting. Its digital recording allows 30 minutes of recording time for incoming or outgoing messages. It is powered by a small power supply. There is no battery backup, but messages are stored even when power is off. The message counter flashes when there is a new message. There is a time-date stamp for each message.The unit and its buttons are described on page eight. You can record your own greeting instead of using the preset greeting. Other buttons allow changing the Language, Time and Day, Rings to answer, message time, and your own security code setting (to prevent anyone else from accessing the system.). The STOP/SET button effects your changes. The preset greeting can be in English or Spanish. Use the GREETING button to record another language. The NEXT or PREVIOUS button are used to change the hour, minutes, and day for the time-stamp. Next the number of rings before the machine answers a call. The `Toll Saver' option will answer after the second ring if you have a new message. You can also set the length of any incoming message. The Security Code is set last; the three-digit code to allow remote access to this unit.The Message Counter is explained on pages 14 and 15. The single digit displays the number of messages. If this number flashes, it is the number of new messages. Else it shows the number of old messages. If more than ten messages, the counter will display the first digit, the last digit, then a dash. Page 15 lists the other displays. The "User's Guide" explains Playing Messages (p.16), Erasing All Messages (but not new messages), Leaving a Memo (p.17), Screening Calls, and Remote Access (p.18). The care of this product is noted on page 19. Troubleshooting Tips are on pages 20-21. This model was made by Thomson, the "GE" of France.I have used this product for a few months without a problem. A local library has used this model for years. My previous machine (another brand) lasted over ten years until it failed after a thunderstorm cut power; its buttons no longer worked after power was restored."
The product works fine and I had no trouble getting it from the vendor
Excellent product - works exactly the same as the Epson brand. I counted the pages and I got approximately the same number of pages.
I've been very happy with this Epson ink. I use my printer A LOT for a multitude of tasks including photo printing, color, and black printing in pictures and in text. I have used different types of paper, from ultra brite to photo, cardstock to regular old copy paper. The ink doesn't run, dries fast, it is bright and clear. The ink lasts a LONG TIME! I never have problems with clogging or blotching of ink or malfunctioning of the cartridges as I have had with generic inks. I must buy from this seller again.
Ok, so recently I stepped on my Earhugger A1000 Action Wrap Headphones. Unfortunately, they sounded good and fit really well. When I went back to BL they were all out. So I tried a pair of RPHS34 headphones by Panasonic (my review didn't go through and don't feel like writing another one). They sound good and fit well but leaked way too much sound. So I ordered a pair of JVC earbuds on Amazon which I will review when they arrive. So on to these Koss P3 earbuds. I didn't buy them. These came with a set of big Koss headphones and since my friend can't stand earbuds, they passed these up to me. Hey, how can I pass down something that's free? Since they were really cheap and the reviews for these were bad I expected these to suck but really these are some good earbuds given the low price. I tried these on some of my music and sounded pretty good, not great but much better than others claim. Just with the EQ off these sounded good. The bass is actually pretty rich to me comparing the Sony MDRE828LP and the Earhugger A1000. These don't provide near as much bass as those that cost much more but do sound good enough for their purchase. Mids sounded fine, But as with most of the cheaper earbuds I noticed a bit much in the 200-500k range. These also provide a good lcean sound to them, you don't hear fantastic detail but you can hear most of which comes out of your tunes. Overall, above average sound quality. Not excelling in anything but not failing in anything.I've also heard that these are too big. Yes, they are larger than most, but with the provided pads on them they fit my rather SMALL ears just fine. These aren't for running or excercising, if you are looking for something on that matter you may want to pick up the Koss KSC22 or the Sony MDRJ10. These don't fall out when walking but any vigorous activity will just not work with these headphones.One thing you MUST know is about the lifetime warranty. Yes, they come with the lifetime warranty. But unless you bought these in the pack with the big headphones, the warranty is pretty useless since you have ot send in five bucks to get them repair. Somewhat a ripoff if you look at the price listing for these seperately.Overall, a good middle-of-the-road chose for those looking for somethnig with good sound and are comfortable and don't want to spend a ton. They are no where near the best headphones you can buy, nor are they the best sub ten, but for a cheap and well suitable replacement for your iPod or other portable player, these are it. 4 stars.

The Panasonic DVD-LS90 portable DVD player is a very nicely made portable DVD player, unlike the other brands out there which you find at Best Buy, Circuit City, Walmart, etc: Initial, Mintek, Audiovox, Samsung, Shinco, ... which often look like they'll fall apart after you pick them up. The LS90 has a solid and confident build and nice styling, and is surprisingly lightweight for such a big-screen portable DVD player, even with the battery attached.The LS90 is very easy to use, and it loads DVDs quickly compared to the other brands. (I've owned quite a few portable DVD players over the years. I was very glad to see Panasonic returning to this market after a couple years of hiatus.) The screen, in classic Panasonic manner, is free style", meaning the clamshell that houses the screen is flexible and you can adjust the screen in a back-and-forth motion, kind of like tilting and telescoping at the same time. This proves great when I watch DVDs on the subway and hold the player in front of me, because I can move the screen closer without having to hold up the entire player.The battery life seems pretty amazing. Panasonic claims "up to 6 hours." You know how it is, these companies always exaggerate a little (or a lot). The 6 hour batttery life can be achieved if you turn the backlight all the way down, use headphones and turn volume to low and turn off any virtual surround sound effects, and run a DVD continuously (i.e., not pausing, stopping, forwarding, rewinding, etc.). Nobody watches DVDs this way. In my abusive everyday use, I can get about 3.5 to 4 hours of battery life, which is still amazing compared to all the other portable DVD players I've owned or used. At the minimum, you should be able to finish a long movie like "Once Upon a Time in America" (director's cut version, of course!) on one charge with minimum compromises on settings.The reason I can't give the LS90 five stars is its screen cold be better. Meaning two things: 1) it could be brigher. Even at the max brightness, it's not bright enough if viewed outdoors. 2) the resolution could be higher. While most high-quality DVD videos will look good most of the time, sometimes you feel the screen is a bit "low-def." To be honest, I laughed when I read someone else claiming his/her Mintek had a sharper screen. I've owned two Mintek players and their screens are no better (or worse) than the LS90's. I just feel a little let down given Panasonic makes some of the best HDTVs on the market. For this price (and given the fact this player is assembled in China by cheap labor), they should have put in a slightly better LCD screen.Conveniently, the player has two headphone jacks, so two people can watch a movie or listen to music at the same time. The DVD drive is reasonably quiet.Even though the LS90 costs more than other brands, it just feels so much more solid and reliable, and it's also quieter and more responsive. Is it worth the extra money? If you are the type who drives a Buick or Lexus or BMW or Acura, I bet you'd say yes. Other people such as myself who drive Corollas and Civics and Malibus and Neons, we can still enjoy the high quality and thoughtful convenience Panasonic has put together in this stylish portable DVD player."
I was very suprise when the item arrival. It did not only come with a screen protector, but also lint-free cleaning cloth and squeegee card.
This marvelous mini drive is my new best friend. Simpletech's 128 MB Bonzai drive is powerpacked. It's fast(1.5 MB/s) and easy to transfer large files like Powerpoint presentations between notebook and desktop, even between Windows and Mac without any drivers! It fits in your pocket and connects to any USB port without any cables or adapters. It's extremely easy to use and even upgradable. I wish I would of had one years ago.
The FC-01 has 3 outputs - 2 are for the twin flash flasheads, and one is for the ring flash assembly. The twinflashes are rated at GN22 and the ringflash is rated at GN36. You can only use one at a time.Doing macro flash photography (even ttl) is difficult because the flash tube is often only 5 inches from the subject it is lighting. Because of this the +/- control for exposure in the camera does not work well, hence the FC-01 takes over the job of adjusting exposure over a +/- 3.0 EV step.Additionally, the FC-01 turns on the modelling lamps in either flash head when the camera calls for extra illumination for focusing, and has a feature to lock the modeling lights on for a given period of time not to exceed 3 minutes for you to compose the shot. This is a very useful feature to get the flash reflection OUT of the picture before shooting it. If you can see the modeling lights in your composition, they will be bright spots from the flash in the final shot.You only need to buy one FC-01. Olympus makes this easy by indicating which products include the FC-01. They are prefixed by an S (i.e. SRF-01 or STF-22) After you purchase one of these and have the controller you can for a lower cost add the opposite macro flash by purchasing the model without the S in front (i.e. RF-11 or TF-22).Because of its greater light output most people will start with the ring flash kit (SRF-01) then add the twin flash later when precise control of lighting is desired. The light from the ring flash will be parallel with the lens, while the twin flash can be rotated and angled inwards for complicated small items. The twin flash can also be dialed down much further than the ring flash in light output by turning off one flash head and setting the other at the minimum guide number. Extremely close objects can be illuminated this way without blooming.Finally - so long as you start out buying a kit (beginning with an S) you will have the FC-01 and not likely need to buy another one unless you want a ring flash camera and twin flash camera, in which case it's probably cheaper to just buy two kits. If your FC-01 dies later in life, this can be used as a replacement. The LCD is in the same location in back as the FL-50 but does a different function depending on ring flash or twin flash usage.If you are buying this product be sure to ask why - it is included in the kits with flashtubes, and not an item most people use so often as to need more than one of. It is nice to be able to replace it without having to purchase a whole kit. Note that the unused jacks have caps that must be inserted prior to use to prevent high voltage. There is a safety interlock system in the head that is simple to use and must be secured before charging the capacitor.
Just helped a friend buy this machine at J&R.; It's just incredible. Not only is it well equipped -- just check the specs! -- but it runs very fast and very quiet. While in store we ran a few of the included applications. I specifically tried out the full version of Adobe Photoshop Elements 2 that comes with the system. The program launched and ran very fast. We opened a couple sample pictures and all the filter effects and transforms we tried were done quickly, much faster than on any other machines.The P4 540 processor is state-of-the-art, bested only by the 560 which is just a tad faster. These processors are faster than the older P4 at the same clock speed, due to improvements in the core and L2 cache. The DDR2 RAM is also very fast, great for video-editing (as the first reviewer points out) and Photoshop tasks.Like all Sony Vaio's, this one is packed with multimedia features. I won't rehash the details. You also get a dual-layer drive; just keep in mind that at this point (Jan. 2005) dual-layer only works in the DVD plus" R/RW format, not the DVD-R/RW format. The Sony's drive can burn DVD-R/RW, DVD "plus" R/RW, and dual-layer DVD "plus" R/RW, plus CD-R/RW, of course. This is just totally state-of-the-art and future-looking.When we did research on which power PC to buy, we discovered that the Sony VAIO VGC series was actually cheaper (sometimes by a lot) than similarly equipped machines from Dell, Gateway or HP. Of course, none of the other makes make a cool machine like this one; this is basically a gamer's machine at an affordable price."
This SD card reader is perfect for what it does and for the price! I use a PDA and laptop constantly and interchangably. The PDA takes SD cards. I use my SD cards and this USB reader as a flash drive so that I have the same files for my PDA and laptop all on one drive. It's fast and simple, portable and very cheap. Highly recommended.

Good protectors, fit and stick well to the LCDs. I also used it for my PDA and works perfect. The squeegee card" that comes to apply the protectors makes any little scratches on them. It is very good! I'm hihgly recommend."
The Fujifilm FinePix F10 is a 6.3MP point-and-shoot digital camera made by Fuji Photo Film Co. of Japan (and in Japan). Fujifilm is Fuji's brandname here in the U.S. If I say Fuji" in this review, you know I mean Fuji the company or Fujifilm the brand.While neither thin nor stylish, the F10 truly excels in picture quality. Whether used indoors or outdoors, the F10 takes sharp pictures with very pleasant colors. If you ever used Fuji's color film in the past, you know the company is famous for true-to-life color reproduction on film. This F10 carries on this tradition and the pictures it takes are very pleasing to the eye.The most amazing part about the F10's excellent, superb picture quality is there's very little noise even at high ISOs, such as 400 or 800. (I'll explain ISO in a bit.) At 1600, the highest setting, you'll notice some noise when you view a picture at its full resolution. However, when you print an ISO 1600 picture from the F10 at 5x7" or smaller, the print quality will still be excellent.(ISO refers to the sensitivity of the camera's sensor. In the old days of film photography, it referred to the film "speed." It was also known as the ASA rating before it became an international standard. The higher the ISO setting, the less light you need for a proper exposure, but also the more noise, or digital specks, you get in the final picture. This phenomenon is a law of physics.)The bottomline is, F10 takes amazingly beautiful pictures. I rate its picture quality higher than my 6.1MP digital SLR, the Nikon D70. I also rate it higher than all my previous compact digital cameras from Canon, Casio, Minolta, Nikon, and Sony. I cannot describe how much I'm in awe with the F10's picture quality performance.In short: if you want a compact digital camera that takes truly excellent pictures, you should just get an F10.There are two reasons for the F10's top-of-the-class picture quality: 1) its CCD sensor (the camera's eye) is 1/1.7" in size, which is bigger than most compact digital cameras' sensors; 2) it uses new-generation Super CCD technology developed by Fuji -- there are actually a total of 6.63 million pixels on the CCD sensor, of which 6.3 million are displayed in the final image, which means the extra 330,000 pixels are used to provide additional information about exposure and color. This extra information, even though not visible in the final picture, helps the camera's ADC (analog-to-digital circuit), which is the camera's brain, produce an awesome picture.Add to the big CCD sensor a superior 3x Fujinon lens (Fujinon is Fuji's brandname for its line of camera lenses) and Fuji's know-how in reproducting eye-pleasing colors, you get picture quality that will make everyone happy.The F10's excellent high-ISO performance also means you can take natural-looking portraits indoors without resorting to the harsh white light of the camera flash. You know how it is: you take a picture of a group of friends indoors, and everyone in the front looks like Michael Jackson (the guy who bleached himself) and the rest in the back look like dark-gray wolves hiding in the forest. The F10 has a "Natural Light" mode which suppresses the flash, jacks up the ISO, and takes a picture that looks soft and pleasant. If you did this with most other digital cameras, you'll get lots of digital freckles on your friends' faces. With the F10, the result is much more pleasing and the freckles much less noticeable, especially in final print (unless you print a poster the size of Niagara Falls).The F10 can also take movies. You choose from two resolutions: VGA (640x480), which is the default, or QVGA (320x240). The movies are taken at 30fps so they are pretty fluid. The VGA resolution means you can actually use this as a camcorder -- just make sure to get a large xD memory card. (See my review of the Fujifilm 1GB Type M xD card for some details.)Now, if you are a control freak type, the F10 may not be right for you. This camera is designed as a point-and-shoot, or as they call it, a foolproof photo machine. You don't get many manual controls. You can't control shutter speed or aperture. You can't focus manually. Even the image quality and resolution settings are simple: whereas other brands let you set quality (i.e., JPEG compression level) and resolution separately, on the F10 you have a total of six choices that encompass both quality/compression and resolution.I *am* a control freak, but I don't mind the F10's lack of manual controls because, 1) I have my Nikon D70 digital SLR whenever I need ultimate "artistic" controls, and 2) I bought the F10 as a point-and-shoot for the times when I'm too lazy to want to make any manual adjustments. You should ask yourself how important manually setting focus or adjusting aperture/shutter speed is for you when you consider the F10.What else is there to say? Oh, the F10 is quite easy to hold. It's not ultra-thin or ultra-compact, so it's actually easier for me to hold. It has a large 2.5" LCD screen which acts both as the viewfinder (to compose the picture) and playback screen. It's sharp and bright (and can "gain up" to superbright in low light situations) and displays fluid motions. The F10 lacks an optical viewfinder (which some photo purists will insist on having) but does have an AF-assist lamp to improve autofocus in dim light situations.In terms of ease of use, the F10 is very easy to pick up and go. You almost don't need to read the manual to get started. On the other hand, almost all controls are accessed via a menu system, which is not the best kind of control scheme in the world. The user's guide is your typical Japanese-translated-into-poor-English type you'd expect from a Japanese manufacturer.In summary, like the other reviewers have pointed out, this camera ranks very high in the picture quality department. As long as you are comfortable *not* having manual controls other than ISO setting and exposure compensation, I bet you'll be very happy with the F10's picture quality. Its exterior styling doesn't excite anyone, but as columnist David Pogue of the New York Times (and Macworld) points out: in photography, it's the inside that should count -- and he endorses the F10.BTW, the F10 is made in Japan, unlike other similar-priced digital cameras which are usually assembled in Indonesia, Thailand, China, or the Phillipines."
In today's digital world, there is never enough storage for all my new gadgets like MP3 players and PDAs. I bought Simpletech's 64 MB MMC card to be able to store more files and songs. It works great. It's very small and reliable.
The new Nikon D70s digital SLR camera is a slight upgrade to the successful and popular D70 model. It retains the size and body construction of the D70, and also keeps all the features of the D70 that make the latter such a prized digital SLR, e.g.: same CCD sensor and DSP chip; instantaneous start-up; fast response, little shutter lag; industry-leading 1/500 flash sync (wow!); 3D color matrix metering; and the powerful i-TTL flash/lighting system. Like the D70, the D70s uses a CompactFlash memory card and is MicroDrive-compatible.The D70s differs from the D70 in the following aspects:- port for electronic cable release (MC-DC1)- larger, 2.0 LCD (vs. D70's 1.8", but same resolution)- slightly more powerful batteryTo many Nikon diehard's disappointment, the D70s did not include more megapixels (unlike the Canon DR XT vs. DR) or a more powerful AF system, and kept D70's slow-poke USB 1.1 (a.k.a. "USB 2.0 full-speed") connection.Since the D70s is just a minor upgrade, I strongly believe the D70 to be a much better value. You should go with the D70s only if you absolutely need the cable release feature.Between the kit and the body-only versions, I highly recommend the kit version. The kit 4x zoom lens is of excellent quality (especialy optics-wise) and is well worth the price differential. It makes a great "street zoom" lens."
The blue filter in b&w; digital photographs will accentuate the sky, reflections of the sky, and will lighten blue items. It will darken red / orange / green items, especially foilage or sunsets.With forensic photography, the blue helps to enhance florescing chemical reactions that give off blue light such as The reaction with 3-aminophthalhydrazide (luminol) - by accenting the glow from the reagent against the background it will be more pronounced in the photograph.Also I use them when shooting under blacklight, but orange can be used for a different effect.Finally filters can be stacked, normally no more than 2, to produce unique effects in B&W; exposure. Again, digital cameras allow instant review of the effect and re-takes on the spot if its not desired. There is lots of room for experimentation. Shooting during the blue hour when the night sky (around sunrise or sunset) is mostly blue can be enhanced with this filter.
I bought this item to my brother for his birthday gift. He says this item is great for him since he can charger his DC batteries anytime when he is traveling.
Apple's iMac line of desktop computers are always some of the most colorful, beautiful, and respected machines in the industry. In October 2005, Apple updated the iMac G5 making them better than ever.You'll be impressed with the iMac G5, from the very moment you begin opening the box. It is beautifully and carefully packaged, and you're greeted by a message inside saying Designed by Apple in California." Then it is time to experience the performance of Apple's fastest consumer-level machine ever...Faster - The new iMac sports faster processors. This 20-inch model now has a 2.1 GHZ Power PC G5 processor, which is up, from 2.0 GHZ, on the previous 20-inch model. Furthermore, the system's architecture is now faster, with the iMac G5 using DDR 2 memory. The iMac includes 512 MB of DDR 2 memory, and it can be upgraded, to a maximum of 2.5 GB of memory.In terms of speed, I was immediately impressed. Applications pop open almost immediately, things snap to the screen, its responsive, and even intensive encoding tasks are handled efficiently.Front Row Experience - Apple has included a new software title that at this time is only available on the iMac G5. Front Row. Front Row comes with your iMac, and a remote control is also included. Front row allows you to watch and listen to media items, on your computer, from across the room. Click one button on the remote, and bring up Front Row, for quick access to your music, movies, podcasts, DVD, and more.Front row is without question the best way to access media files, on a personal computer. It blew me away, with its graphics, sound, and the overall experience it creates. Turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and bring up Front Row. Your friends' jaws will drop!Built in iSight - The new iMac includes a built in iSight camera, so you can video conference with friends right out of the box. Furthermore, with the built in isight you can take advantage of another new application, available only on this imac right now, called Photobooth. Photobooth allows you to snap photos of yourself or friends, from the built-in camera and add wild effects.Appearance - The new iMac G5 is thinner than the previous model making it more beautiful than ever. This machine will stand out on your desk.Display - The iMac 20-inch features a widescreen display, which is great for watching movies and fitting items such as wide spreadsheets, or media projects, onto the screen. You can also squeeze several applications into view, making yourself more productive. The resolution is 1650x1050, and the specifications on the display in this iMac now exceed the specifications on Apple's professional 20-inch cinema display.Hard Drive - The iMac G5 20-inch includes a big 250 gigabyte hard drive, which will allow you to store thousands of songs, pictures, and hundreds of hours of video.Mac OS X - If you're considering Macintosh for the first time, you're going to love the Mac operating system, Mac OS X Tiger. It is incredibly user friendly, and you'll quickly find the interface and design is saving you time. Furthermore, Mac OS X is much more secure than Windows, so you can put your mind at rest.iLife - Apple still includes iLife with every Mac. iLife is a great way to manage your personal digital life. Store and manage your digital images in iPhoto, jam to music in iTunes, create music in Garageband, and create simple movies in iMovie.Furthermore, there are convenient applications built right into the operating system such as Dashboard, iCal (a great calendar that syncs up with your external devices including iPod), Dictionary, Expose, Stickies, DVD Player, and more.Wireless - Your iMac will come standard, with an Airport Extreme card, for wireless networking. Furthermore, a bluetooth module is included, allowing you to use wireless devices, such as keyboards and mice, plus sync devices such as a mobile phone.Value - You will not find many computers available today that delivers what this iMac has at such an affordable price. A fast processor, beautiful 20-inch widescreen display, wonderfully designed computer case, big hard drive, double layer DVD burner, fantastic software, and a lot more. Amazon makes it even more affordable, with great rebates.Overall, I am truly impressed by the new iMac G5. In fact, it may be one of Apple's most impressive releases, in the past couple years. The iMac delivers high end consumer performance, with features that should meet your toughest expectations. There is simply not much that cannot be done with this very capable computer. Enjoy the new iMac G5. It's a great machine."
Use rechargeable NiMH batteries. The TV does drain batteries fast, but the picture and sound are great. Reception is good where you have strong broadcast signals. Otherwise, it could get grainy. But still fun to have when traveling.
It's pretty unbelievable at first, but these inexpensive headphones really give you quite a bit of use for your money! They connect easily to MP3 players and similar devices; and the bass is awesome just as everyone says it is. Moreover, at this price you simply can't go wrong.If you listen to a CD or MP3 player daily, I would recommend buying a few sets of these. They do go south eventually and you won't have to worry about waiting for another pair to ship.These are also much, much better than earbud headphones; the earbuds always make my ears hurt! The over the head strap is fairly comfortable and that alone makes this a much better choice than the earbud type of headphones.In addition, use these for young kids who may not be all that gentle with them. That way if they break or get lost you won't be out too much money.I highly recommend these headphones; they may not be the very best out there (after all, they're not Sennheiser, Skull Candy hesh headphones or Skullcrushers) but the sound quality is really quite good and you can't beat the price. You won't be too upset if these break or get lost, either.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar 128MB Memory Stick, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Update 10/2010 - this was written prior to the E3 and E5 - both of which CAN control the flash for a spread of lighting by changing flash intensity (you'll need a HV-1 high voltage supply to be able to keep up at 5 flashes per second). This review says the flash is the only way to adjust light intensity which was true on the E300 prior to the E3 and E5's introduction. Now it can be controlled from the camera - that's the only change. . Personally I've developed a liking for the twin flash for macro work after using both the ring and twin. The ability to angle the light and check for hot spots with the modeling light included prior to shooting the exposure is very helpful, while the ring light shows up in many shots as a ring of light in specular environments. Photoshopping it out isn't hard, just a pain. The twin can be adjusted to not overlight an area of the exposure. Now on with the reviewOlympus manufactures two flash units, a GN36 ring flash and a GN22 twin flash system. Both use the FC-01 flash controller, however each can be angled uniquely. While the ring flash is directed out parallel to the lens, the twin flash can be adjusted over 45 degrees inward to the lens, and rotated horizontally or vertically. For hard to light scenes the twin flashes can be removed and attached to small tripods. The FC-01 controller, which must be close, can be extended using an FC-05 cable.The difference in the TF-22 and the STF-22 is that the STF-22 kit includes the FC-01 flash controller. TheOlympus TF-22 Twin Flash Head (Needs FC-01 Flash Controller, FR-1 & SR-1)is an add-on for existing SRF-01 owners.The twin flash fits almost every lens made. On the 50mm prime lens, it does need the FR-1 adapter (as does the ring flash) - but this protects the lens focus which extends nearly 50 mm from the lens body, so it's not a bad accessory to have.On the 50-200 mm zoom and the 14-54 mm lenses, the ring flash simply mounts to the bayonet for the sunshade mount. The twin flash screws into the filter threads on these lenses for mounting.One lens can not use the ring flash at all - the 11-22 mm wide angle which is a good macro lens as well. The reason is that is spreads out to a 72 mm filter thread, much larger than the normal 67 mm thread. The TF-22 CAN be used with the 11-22 mm lense because it has a double threading, with the second for the 72 mm filter thread on the 11-22 mm lens making it an exceptional wide angle macro lens.As a result the TF-22 works on everything the Ring flash does, and one more.The FC-01 flash controller has unique operating modes depending on which flash unit is plugged in. On the TF-22 it gives you 16 steps to balance the amount of light sent to the A" flash and the "B" flash. This can create interesting lighting effects. When used with the Ring Flash or Twin Flash, the FC-01 MUST be used to adjust your fine tuning illumination of the scene, as the camera can not keep up at the close distances. In effect, the +/- control on the camera is deactivated using a macro flash, but the FC-01 has a +/- 3.0 adjustment on the flash itself, so you are able to get the perfect exposure. You have the option of TTL metering or using full manual control if you have gone to manual exposure on the camera.In all cases, with all flashes, you have modeling lights that can be activated by a button on the FC-01. I find the best use for these is to predict where your image of the flash will appear in the final photo by looking for the modeling lights in the viewfinder prior to the exposure. The twin flash gives you the ability to angle the lights in such a way as to keep the glare out of the lens and keep spots out of your final picture. With the ring flash you end up moving the whole camera.Note - Due to the angles possible on the twin flash you MUST have clean filter glass or else every spec of dust will show up in your photo, expecially with the 11-22 mm lens due to its depth of field at high f stops.ORDERING:You only need ONE FC-01 flash controller for macro flashes, so olympus setup their ring/twin flash systems into both KITS and add-ons. If you buy the ring flash KIT (SRF-01) you can add on the twin flash later (TF-22) and have both options. If you buy the twin flash kit to begin with (STF-22) you can buy the ring flash add on later (RF-01) and have the same kit! Unless your FC-01 breaks, or you feel the need to have two macro flashes ready at all times on two backs, then don't buy two kits (beginning with S in the model number) or else you will double up on your flash controllers. The FC-01 can also be purchased separately.As for compatibility, the FC-01 is a copy of the FL-50 and uses the same high voltage generators, such as the SHV-01 and the FP-01. In fact, you can combine the AA NiMH cells in the flash, the FP-01, and the SHV-01 all 3 at the same time to get sub 1 second cycle times with full flash intensity. Compared to the 7-9 seconds on the FL-50, sub second recharge times are great for sequence shootingIn summary- Macro Flashes are good from 6 cm to 6 meters- Ring flash is brighter than the Twin Flash- Twin flash is more controllable than the ring flash for extreme closeups- any product beginning with (S) (SRF-01, STF-22, SHV-01, etc) is a complete kit- The macro flash kits are in keeping with the long distance FL-50(R) flashes and make use of the same high voltage rapid flash supplies."
The Z25 and Z35 are low-end printers designed for use at home. They use a USB cable to connect to a computer running Windows 98, Me, 2000, and XP after you install the software from the CD. You must select CANCEL when the OS detects the connected printer and only use the CD software. The 24 page manual explains the proper method to set up this printer. You connect the modular power supply, the USB cable, install the print cartridges (#26 tricolor, #16 black) into the color-coded receptacles (light green for tricolor, dark green for black), then load the plain paper on the top and extend the paper exit tray. The printer software is installed last. Run the SETUP program to install the software (if it doesn't start automatically). Follow the instructions on the monitor screen. Print an alignment page so the tricolor and black cartridges will be properly aligned. This printer will work when either or both cartridges are installed. You can customize the printer settings in Print Properties". Various sized paper can be used in portrait or landscape mode. When installing the printer you may have to create a USB Virtual printer port if another printer was previously defined (not for printers connected to a parallel port). Like other Lexmark printers the paper follows a shallow curve in printing.The Lexmark Solutions Center will guide you in printing photos, envelopes, banners, etc. It will help to solve printing problems. A blinking paper feed light may result in an error message on your screen. Page 11 offers suggestions to follow when there is a problem. There are pages for Mac OS 8.6 to 9.2 and Mac OS X version 10.0.3 to 10.1. Page 20 tells how to contact Lexmark. The Index to topics is on pages 19 and 20. Other manuals warn against setting up a printer during an electrical storm, or removing the inkjet cartridges except to replace or clean them. This printer has a modular plug-in power supply with an attached power cord. [Does this make it run warmer?]The audio response will tell you what to do if there is a problem. A right click on the "Lexmark Z25-Z35" icon will allow you to choose the Lexmark Solution Center for various options. You can select the alignment tool to fix blurry edges, print a test page, or install a new print cartridge. This is one of the least expensive printers and a bargain when bought used for light duty printing. You may find a better printer at a higher price. Shutting down the computer turns the printer off, applying power turns it on.[I found the indicator for ink levels wasn't correct for the used tricolor cartridge when the printer was installed on another computer.]"
Great product - works exactly the same as the Epson brand. I counted the pages and I got approximately the same number of pages. No clogups in fact, I believe I cleaned the heads less than I had to with the genuine replacement cartridge.
Sony makes an excellent charger for the G series" battery that gives my digital camera the juice it needs to take those photos! This charger is compact, easy to plug into just about any American made electrical outlet and it can completely charge my camera's battery in an amazingly short 90 minutes. This really came in handy when I recently lost my original battery charger; and although some people complain about the price on this website, as of the time I am writing this the Amazon price is about ten dollars cheaper than what I had to pay in the store!In addition, because this is such a compact battery charger it's easy to bring it along when you go on vacation. It certainly is travel-size!Overall, an excellent and reliable battery charger for a "G series" battery. Highly recommended.(And no, I am not affiliated with Sony! I just really like this charger.)"
Even though digital cameras are all the rage these days -- and I myself have three of them! -- sometimes you do want to use a film camera, especially when you can't carry an AC adapter with you, or don't want to shell out lots of money for extra batteries, to power your digital camera. Also, ISO/ASA 100 film or slower still gives you the best clarity outside of the negative and professional realms.This Olympus camera is a great basic film camera -- and it's a terrific value at less than sixty bux. It has the following features that I consider essential on every camera:-- auto focus. Some very low-end cameras (but this is not a low-end camera!) only have focus free", which means there's no focus in the lens. Olympus' auto-focus and auto-exposure systems work very well.-- zoom. Of course, this being a film camera means the zoom is optical. It's only 2x, but if you want more zoom you'll have to pay for it. (The Pentax IQ 145M does provide 4x zoom for under 100 bux, but that camera is also bigger in size.)-- date imprint. I'm one of those anal types who must document every picture I take. Being able to print the date, while irksome to some people, is a must for me. With a digital camera the photo file has a digital stamp which Windows XP can read (date, time, camera used, size, resolution, image quality, etc.). With a film camera, "quartz date" comes closest to having some extra info on the picture.-- lens cover. Some cameras don't even come with this!This camera is also pretty compact and feels right in my hands. The buttons are laid out just right. I find the lens a bit slow in moving in and out but not detrimental to picture-taking in most situations. (I don't shoot sports.) Red-eye reduction works ok but I rarely use it. Flash range is good, but you have to remember that a built-in flash can never do a good job at doing soft lighting.Picture quality is good with this camera. Assuming you use brandname film like Kodak and Fuji, you'll get pleasing pictures. (If you use a generic brand you got for free at the street corner from a guy in a funny hat, you may be disappointed in the prints... with any camera.) This is really a basic consumer camera, so don't expect lots of fine controls as you can with SLR's.Some reviewers complain about reliability problems, but from my experience Olympus cameras are some of the most reliable on the market. I haven't had mine long enough to know for sure, but the body seems sturdy and should last a long time."
This 23 widescreen (16:9) HD LCD TV from Sharp is not a model from Sharp's highly acclaimed Aquos product line, but rather sold by Sharp Systems as a PC/Mac monitor. [You can find detailed product info on Sharp Systems' website.] This is actually a good thing, because while this monitor has the same excellent image quality enjoyed by its Aquos cousins, its price is more "reasonable" IMHO, if you don't need the bells and whistles or the advanced styling of Aquos LCD TVs. (Besides, Sharp has now reserved the Aquos label only for HDTV screens 26" or larger. Note that while all current Aquos models have the important HDMI input, this 23" monitor doesn't, one more reason it's not branded an Aquos.)I've looked at many, many LCD screens. I like Sharp's screens because they are not overly contrasty or bright. Too many LCDs are too bright, even at the lowest setting, making watching TV and DVDs quite a pain in the eyes. Sharp LCDs give the most natural colors and a true dynamic brightness/contrast range, so almost anyone can find a setting to his or her liking. Now, the screen can still get really bright (up to 500 nits), so it looks good even during daytime when sunlight comes into the room. Its viewing angles are good, too, so 3 or 4 people can watch it together.As a PC/Mac monitor, it renders text sharply and showcases your photos and videos nicely. I use Pantone's ColorVision Spyder 2 to calibrate the monitor, to obtain optimal settings from a photo-editing standpoint. Prior to this this monitor, I was never completely satisfied with the results, but now I am.The monitor is reasonably good-looking styling-wise. It has a lot of input jacks including component video and DVI-D, but I have to warn you that there's no HDMI connection on this, which is one reason why the price is reasonable on such a namebrand set (all current Sharp Aquos models do).Of course, because this is primarily marketed as a business-oriented TV LCD monitor, it supports VGA. It has a built-in NTSC tuner for tuning in to regular TV stations; this model is "HDTV-ready," meaning it has HDTV definition but you'll need to hook up an HDTV source, like an HDTV antenna or HDTV cable box, in order to watch HDTV content. You can also hook an HD-DVD or Blueray DVD player to this but keep in mind this doesn't have an HDMI so you'll end up using component video which does not do justice to HD-DVD or Blueray contents.In short, this is a great LCD TV for a great price. The 23" size is perfect for the bedroom or study. It's excellent both as an HDTV and as a PC/Mac monitor. I highly recommend this.UPDATE: There are various reasons to pay more for an Aquos LCD TV. One is size (Aquos models start at 26"), another is the HDMI input port, and yet another is the ability to reproduce rich black levels. Aquos LCD TVs are famous for their black level performance. I've discovered that if you watch movies with a lot of dark scenes, there's a huge difference between Aquos and this model. This model's black performance is acceptable, but if you must have the best image quality across all the colors and black levels, definitely go with an Aquos, which employs the most advanced LCD technology in the world."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk Cruzer with 256MB Secure Digital Memory, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
This computer runs the new Windows XP Media Center Edition, which is basically a superset of Windows XP Professional Edition. The extras in this superset are the multimedia enhancements that turn specially designed PCs (&quot;media center PCs&quot; such as this Pavilion) into a 1) DVD player/recorder (yes, you can actually record DVD movies from your own videos, but not duplicating commercial DVD content); 2) souped-up TV with digital recording capability (like UltimateTV or better known TiVO); 3) &quot;one-touch&quot; music center; 4) easy-to-use photo center.The hardware specs are very impressive. Speedy 2.53Ghz Pentium 4 processor coupled with 512MB of RAM and 120GB hard disk. A DVD-RW and CD-RW combo drive, with 2.4/2.4/8 for DVD and 12/10/32-48 for CD. Klipsch 200W speaker system. And nVidia GeForce 4 MX420 graphics card with 64MB VRAM. You also get USB 2.0 and IEEE 1394 ports; slots for CompactFlash II, SmartMedia, Secure Digital/Multimedia Card, and Memory Stick; as well as Ethernet and modem cards. It's as complete a PC as I've seen.In terms of day-to-day use, the Media Center PC differs from an ordinary PC in where it's used (anywhere in the home), for what it's used (as a PC *and* TV/video/audio/pictures center), how it's used (with a remote control in addition to keyboard and mouse), as well as by whom it's used (from the toddler to great-great-grandma). It's a very versatile and powerful computing/entertainment environment... and very easy to set up.That said, the price for this model does NOT include a monitor, so when you buy the complete system, you are paying a roughly 25% premium over a similarly equipped &quot;regular&quot; Windows XP PC. Is it worth this premium? I think so because 3/4 of my family members are computer-phobic, and this wonderful new product has appealed to all of them like no computer before.
Passionate iPod users know at least one thing about the iPod line-up, and that is they are always changing. In late June 2005, Apple discontinued this 30 GB iPod Photo, when they moved to an all-color display lineup. The iPod is now available in 20 GB & 60 GB, but the new 20 GB is identical in every way to this 30 GB only with smaller capacity. That makes this 30 GB iPod with color display the best value in iPods rights now. For only $15 more than the retail price of the 20 GB color display iPod, you can have a 30 GB, with identical features and dimensions. Of course, this model is no longer being manufactured, so get it while you can. It is also thinner than the 60 GB iPod, which is important to many people, unless you truly need the extra 30 GB, which few would.Battery - 15-hours, which is great as it allows you to use your iPod longer in every day circumstances before charging, while also giving you the power needed to fly almost anywhere in the world, on a single charge. Compare this to some of the earlier iPods that had only eight hours of battery life.What does the color screen add, for you might ask, I'm listening to music, why a color screen?" Well, album art is one benefit. The iPod displays the album art, when playing songs, which helps create the feeling for the album. Furthermore, iTunes works with iPhoto on Mac and Adobe products on PC, in order to transfer your photo libraries to your iPod. You can then view your cherished photo libraries on the go, which might come in handy when you're telling the story of that huge fish no one seems to believe. However, the best part of iPod with color is that you can buy the optional photo adapter, plug it into the dock connector on your iPod, and transfer songs direct from your digital camera via USB. This allows you to move potentially gigabytes of photographs to your iPod, while on vacation, freeing up the memory card in your camera. This is truly a time and money saver! You can return from vacation with thousands of images that would have never fit on your camera's memory card alone. Finally, you can view slideshows of photographs, and display them on a television, with optional A/V cables sold separately.Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. However, on a Mac, you'll immediately enjoy the synchronization of iTunes, your contacts, iCal calendars, Backup software, and of course iPhoto. On PC, you will have iTunes, but you'll need a third-party application from Adobe to sync photos the right way, while, you can find some shareware on the Internet that will allow you to sync other information, addresses, etc. that you might be interested in trying out.Finally, Podcasting! The newest version of iTunes is 4.9, and it features Podcasting support. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, and this iPod supports podcasting, when you update it with the newest firmware available at Apple.com.Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like.Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Plus, right now, the 30 GB iPod Photo is the best value in podding. Enjoy your iPod experience."
This digital camera has many features. You must read the manual to if you never uses a camera like this. Page 3 identifies the features. Set the `Mode dial' to AUTO, insert fresh AA batteries, then turn on the `Power button'. Page 4 explains how to set the Date/Time and Languages (any of 22 languages). You should read the pages on using the camera buttons, first those needed to take still photographs (page 7). Pages 7 and 8 explain the features available with this camera. Pages 10 to 11 explain the menus on the camera. The `Size' and `Quality' affect the size of the photo file and the number that can fit on a given memory card. Pages 13 and 14 explain the `Setup Menu'. You should install the application software before downloading pictures to your PC. If you use Ni-MH rechargeable batteries rather than alkaline you must use the `Setup Menu' to identify the batteries used.If you choose `1600x1200' for `Size' and `Fine' for `Quality' the photo files will need about 524Kb of file space (two per megabyte). You can delete unwanted photos from memory. The SD memory card can be removed to print selected photos at some stores. If you expect to take many pictures keep extra batteries handy. Batteries too weak for this camera can still be used for flashlights, remote control devices, etc. Always use the top-grade batteries made for digital cameras. If the batteries are weakening an indicator will show less than 3 bars. If the batteries are too weak the camera will shut down, or the screen will just go blank with the lens extended. You must put in fresh batteries to recover and turn the camera on or off. If you should press the lens to one side it can stick and not retract. Gently press the lens toward the center and turn off the camera [this worked for me]. Like other delicate electronic devices, dropping it on a hard surface may cause expensive damage.The installation software requires a Pentium or AMD K6-2 with Windows 98, 98SE, Me, 2000, or XP. To install a memory card first turn off the camera and open the cover. The front of the memory card faces the front of the camera, the pins on the card face the back. Page 5 of the manual explains how to format the memory card before use. This will also delete all photos on the memory card. The manual is adequate but could use more explanations and a larger font.

How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SimpleTech 64MB ATA Flash PC Card, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
Wow, the price on this USB 2.0 cable is just incredible! It's high-quality, high-speed (USB 2.0), and just all-around excellent.Plus, it can be used with more than just printers. You can also use it with many external drives (hard disk, DVD drive, CD drive, Zip drive, etc.) that use USB 2.0.This is the best USB cable to get.
Syntax Group is an Asian company that has recently entered the LCD market here stateside. Its first offerings of LCD TVs are already getting positive reviews from users. ExtremeTech (a PC Mag offshoot) recently reviewed the 30-inch LCD TV and gave it an 8 out of 10. I also found other positive independent online reviews, so I decided to give this new brand a try, and got the 27-inch model after landing a new job.Wow! I was very impressed with the image quality of this LCD TV. I had seen low-cost" LCD TVs from Westinghouse (at Best Buy) and Gateway (at one of the now-defunct Gateway Country stores), and they were disappointing in contrast and image quality. The Syntax Olevia, despite its silly name, is definitely the best I've seen for this price class. Of course, if you take a Sharp Aquos or a Panasonic LCD TV side-by-side with the Olevia, the Sharp and Panasonic will be much better, giving you a more vibrant image, but they also cost almost twice as much as the Olevia! If you are absolutely into the best LCD quality, you have to get a Sharp; they are just the best. But if you want value but don't want to sacrifice too much in quality, this is probably the best balance.The Olevia is also generous in terms of video inputs. You also get DVI, something a lot of LCD TVs omit. The VGA port means you can use this as a computer monitor, but I haven't tried that yet. The native scan supports 720p and the internal scaler allows you to view 1080i programs as well. Hooked up to a progress-scan DVD player, the Olevia makes movies a joy to watch.In summary, the Olevia is a great entry-level LCD TV. If 27" is a bit too small for you, go for the 30" model which costs just $400 more. Syntax is also coming out with bigger screens later this year."
The ear speakers come with a collection of dome and double dome eartips. While none of these geometrically perfect tips are a substitute for a professionally made earmold, the double dome design fits and holds better than the single dome does. I plan to eventually get left and right custom earmolds for a better fit and seal.My hunch is that the bass response will improve with custom earmolds but with the stock tips I found it was not as strong as less expensive earbuds. The overall sound quality, however was much better with a more linear response. I found the best support for the ear speakers was to have the cable exit pointing up then wrap it behind my ear for better support. These are heavy and the extra weight needs to be supported somehow.Overall they are the best pair of earbuds I own. Stay away from the $13 china specials - they are very nonlinear in response.
The iPod Shuffle was announced and made available, in January 2005.I received my iPod Shuffle, about five weeks, afters its introduction, so I have been using it, for over seven months. I should point out that I already had a full size iPod, but I wanted the shuffle, for its small size and extreme portability.The shuffle is incredibly impressive, when you first receive it. Its tiny size and light weight really strikes you as unbelievable.The shuffle charges and syncs to your iTunes library by USB 2.0. Charging takes about three hours, if you want a full charge, and the syncing of songs is pretty fast. You can have the shuffle select the songs randomly from your iTunes library, or choose your own custom mix.I find the lack of display on the shuffle to not be an issue. The reason being is that this shuffle holds about 120 songs, so there really isn't a need, for a display. After all, who wants to be looking at a tiny display? I just want to listen to my music. You can choose to listen to your music in the same order you setup your shuffle playlist, in iTunes. Or, you can have the shuffle take you on a random shuffle.The shuffle has been reliable over the past six months. It still works great, looks great, and the battery still lasts close to the specification 12 hours.Use as an USB thumb drive - One feature about the shuffle I love is that, when you enable disk mode, you can set an amount of space that the shuffle dedicates to files. Then you can put documents, photographs, or other files onto the shuffle. Then by going to another computer and inserting the shuffle, you can access those files. The shuffle works as both a music player, and a USB thumb drive! For me, this makes it an even more amazing value.Overall, I still use my full size iPod, for the majority of the time. However, when I want extreme portability and something that is not weighing down my pocket, I use the shuffle. It is also nice to use, if you're going to be an environment where you're concerned about damage or theft to your iPod, since the shuffle is less expensive. The iPod Shuffle makes a great second iPod, for iPod fans. However, it makes a great first and only iPod, for many people too. The iPod Shuffle brings the convenience of having any song (up to approximately 120 on this model), from your iTunes music library with you, wherever you go. Music makes life a lot of fun, and this shuffle helps bring the music to you.

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The X Digital Media 256MB REDLINE PROformance 70X Compact Flash Card, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

Pros:- The time on the clock is easy to set and use.- The clock is easy to see with the bright time option.- The alarm can actually go off even if the batteries are dead. However, this only works with battery power.- Very durable. Dropped it from a bunk-bed about 10 times, and still no defects.- Nap setting is a great future of the alarm clock.Cons:- The alarm sound is kind of quiet and inconsistent. Both two alarms are quite quiet, and are just small beeps that are 1 1/2 seconds apart.- The radio quality is poor. It's hard to get even some local stations to work correctly.- The speaker is very poor. The sound on the radio disorts a lot.BOTTOMLINE: If you're looking for a cheap yet durable alarm clock with a radio you're not gonna use often, this one is a perfect pick. If you're expecting a lot from the radio, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, great alarm clock!
This official Panasonic camcorder battery also works for the new VDR-D300 and VDR-D250 3CCD DVD camcorders. I had checked Panasonic's website to confirm before I bought it for my VDR-D300. It works very well.As a gadget expert (if there were such a thing), I highly recommend getting an official battery. Sure, the generics can cost 1/3 as much, but you run serious and real risks of getting an explosion or other undesirable results. I don't say this because I work for Panasonic; I don't work for any electronics company or any electronics store. I say it because I believe 1) a real battery is a worthy long-term investment for your expensive camcorder, and 2) your life and well-being are worth more than the price difference. You also save yourself lots of hassles down the road.
Better-looking than previous Averatec offerings, the AV5500 is great for web-surfing... and perfect as a companion at the cafe.The AMD Sempron mobile-edition processor is no slouch, but it's best for Internet applications rather than CPU-intensive programs like Adobe Photoshop or Windows Moviemaker. Its 256MB of RAM, the absolutely minimum for Windows XP, also means it won't run Microsoft Office well, but is adequate for Internet Explorer, Outlook Express, Windows Media Player, etc.; just make sure you don't run too many applications at the same time, or the machine will feel very sluggish.As others have pointed out, you should adjust the power option in Control Panel and also download an updated driver to get the maximum performance out of the AMD CPU. The Averatec is configured to run at battery-saving speed out-of-box, which also means slower performance. If you have the money, I highly recommend you upgrade the RAM to at least 512MB, for a high-octane boost in performance.The Averatec is great for the cafe because it has a nice styling and built-in wi-fi. I do think it's a bit on the heavy side, esp. if you have to lug the AC adapter along -- the built-in battery lasts about two hours with wi-fi on and screen set to mid-brightness (and CPU set to power-saving mode). On the other hand, it has a big, bright screen (even at half-brightness) and decent keyboard, and its good looks will beat out the Dells and Gateways others have to live with. It also lets others know you are unique and value- and style-conscious!Since Averatec is not a major brand (although they are reportedly growing fast), you should probably trek over to Staples or Best Buy or Circuit City and take a look at the physical machine before deciding whether you like it or not. But for less than $700, you are getting a lot of bang for the buck, and the machines I've had have not developed any problems so far. (Knock on wood!)

Have used mine for over 3 years now, and never needed to clean anything! Mouse movement is precise and smooth, and it's pure plug-n-play. It can't get easier than this. Solid quality, will probably last a lifetime... hopefully I'll live a long life. :)
I found no problems with it... it arrived quickly and it works as great as my original. Worth it!
While the Onkyo TX-SR502B is not a high-powered receiver, it's still a great value for a starter's home theater receiver, esp. considering the namebrand and high quality you are getting. The 6.1 digital surround is awesome; get Onkyo speakers to go with this. The moderate output power is actually a boon for those of us who live in apartment buildings, since we can never crank up our speakers to high decibels anyway. (Those living in a house with the next neighbors 10 miles away should get a receiver with more power.)BTW, if you don't already have your own speakers, you might want to consider a home theater in a box (HTIB) system that includes both the receiver and teh speakers. Onkyo and Yamaha have some high-quality systems for decent prices.
I bought this item for my friend in order to charge her iPod Phot anytime.
This 20 Sharp has regular NTSC resolution, so it's best suited for regular cable and broadcast, although it'll handle digital contents with aplomb, looking better than most other LCD or CRT sets. (I'm not sure why Amazon's description calls this EDTV; to me EDTV means 800x600 resolution.) The picture quality is where Sharp's LCDs shine: the colors are rich at default, and can be pleasantly saturated when you increase the color level. The set itself is quite stylish and makes a great fashion statement. Even though the price is on the high side, you get much better reliability and picture quality than cheaper brands. Enjoy this nice LCD TV!"

I have both this Iomega HDD 20GB portable hard drive and another 20GB drive from Archos, and I recommend that you buy the Iomega. Sure, this Iomega drive is not the fastest, smallest, or cheapest 20GB portable drives out there, but it comes with a driver that simply works.I had so much trouble getting the Archos drive to work, and even to this day, it occasionally drops the annoying BSOD bomb, always at the most inopportune time. The Iomega drive, on the other hand, feels much more solid and actually works beautifully each time. The 4200-RPM spin rate is a bit low, but considering that you'll never get close to the 480-Mbps rated speed of USB 2.0 -- in fact, the max I get is about 1/10 of that! -- the rotational speed is not a bottleneck.Overall, I would recommend an IEEE 1394 portable hard drive because of its real-world higher I/O throughput. But since USB ports are much more common, a USB drive is also more convenient. And in this category, I heartily recommend this Iomega product as well as the 30GB version.Oh, one last thing, on the power issue: on my main desktop, an Acer P3, sometimes I can use the Iomega hard drive without the power cord. Not always, though. In any case, it's also a good idea to carry the AC adapter with you. Same goes for IEEE 1394 external drives.

Glad I waited for the price on this great basic CD/CD-R/CD-RW player to come down. It was a good value, and now Amazon has turned it into an excellent value! Attractive design, easy to press buttons, nicely fit headphones, and Panasonic quality. (I laughed when I read the review by the guy who dropped it.) A great choice if all you want is a basic CD player. And over 30 hours on two cheap AA batteries!
Instant CD/DVD includes a very good suite of tools for burning CDs and DVDs. It includes all the features found in &quot;Instant Copy,&quot; which allows you to copy DVDs, even fitting a 9GB DVD onto a regular CD-R or CD+R disc. In addition, Pinnacle throws in tools to capture videos and burn homemovie DVDs and also rip and burn CD music. Usually these tools are not worth the extra you'd pay, but the rebate makes this a very good deal.The only downside is Instant CD/DVD is slower than the DVD burning program that came with my burner. But, truth is, since burning DVDs usually takes tons of time anyway, whether it's 15 hours or 16 hours doesn't really make a difference to me, hence I still give Instant CD/DVD 5 stars for bringing all your burning needs together nicely.Since it worked out-of-box on my WinXP laptop, I have no contact with tech support so can't comment on that. My tip for successful burning is: #1, buy a brand-name DVD burner; stick with Sony, Pioneer or Toshiba; the money you save on a generic brand ain't worth the troubles. #2, see tip#1.
The battery fits my ipod nano's battery compartment. It keeps playing while I was charging my nano. Simple to use and worth to buy with such price.
My title pretty sums up this 17-inch LCD monitor by Kogi, a small company with offices in California and Taiwan. While not a namebrand, the monitor's quality is commendable, with a bright screen and no dead pixels on the three units I received. (Dead pixels are dots that display only one color all the time, usually red. You can see them when you set your screen saver to blank so against the dark background you'll see these red or blue dots. Very rarely they can be white.) You get true 17 inches of viewable area (measured diagonally) and a high contrast ratio, which makes text and pictures look sharp. Sold at a very attrative price, the Kogi is a stand-out.
The new Optio SV differentiates itself from other slim-profile digital cameras by offering a whopping 5x optical zoom! This is just amazing achievement on the part of Pentax, being able to outgun all competition in this important area. The SV is comparable in width and height to the popular Canon SD300 and SD400 models, but is about 1/3 thicker. It takes good-quality pictures. Not quite as great as the Canon models or even the Casio EX-Z55/Z57, but still very acceptable both for screen display and for print.But the SV suffers from two problems that may limit its appeal. Let me first say that these are not fatal" problems. For *your* needs, you may find the pros of this super-zoom camera more than offset the two problems, so by all means if this fits your needs, go for it. I really, really like the 5x zoom, period.The two problems are:1) Shutter lag. All digital cameras have shutter lag (the time between you press the shutter button and when the picture is actually taken), but this one is a bit longer than its competition. It also takes longer time than many competitors (Canon, Casio, Nikon, Sony) to write an exposed image to memory. This results in a shot-to-shot time that was normal two years ago but is considered on the long side this day and age.2) Battery life. This is where I've got a serious beef, as the rechargeable battery packs enough power for only 80 or so pictures. The Canon SD300, in comparison, can do about 200 pictures per charge and the Casio EX-Z55/57 can do 350 or more. With the Pentax Optio SV, you have to either buy 2 spare batteries or pack the charger with you wherever you go.If Pentax could improve battery life and shutter lag, this would be the ultracompact digicam of my choice."
Iomega Zip 250MB SCSI DriveThis device has a rectangular dark blue case powered by a separate power supply. It connects to the parallel port on your computer, attached when power is off. You should select the icon to Unplug or Eject Hardware" to remove this device. The IOMEGA software should be installed on Windows 2000. If the unit does not have an eject button on the drive you must select the EJECT command from the Properties menu. It is good to do this all the time because of the disk caching system. The 250 MB drives can read and write to 100 MB ZIP disks, but slower than with a 250 MB disk. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an IOMEGA disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords (not usable on a 100MB disk). "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details.Computers have a limited number of IDE devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical. Replaceable 250 MB ZIP disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology. The 250 MB ZIP disk is less widely used than the 100 MB disk. ZIP disks reuse deleted space unlike a CD whose space is consumed when you replace files. Falling prices for CD discs solve that problem. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different Windows systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by different software on another system. [You may find support on the Internet for USB Mass Storage Devices for Win98.]To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: "SCSI controllers", "Iomega", "Iomega Parallel Port Interface", then "Finish".You should set the Printer Port as EPP or ECP.Then modify the 'Settings' for the Iomega Parallel Port Interface as follows.The port settings assumes the usual I/O address.'My Computer'; 'Properties'; 'System Devices'; 'Device Manager';'SCSI Controllers'; 'Iomega Parallel Port Interface'; 'Properties'; 'Settings'/mode:eppecr /port:378 /speed:6"
I posted a photo above you can look at to see the objective glass element on this lens - it has some severe curvature to obtain the near 90 degreee field of view without distortion. I also plan to mount it in my linearity tester when finished using it for a customer and will post a photo of its overall resolution.This lens would be IDEAL for a realator who takes curb apeal" shots of homes, and interior shots where it is difficult to see floor to ceiling and wall to wall. At 11 MM there is no fisheye effect and all lines are straight. Unfortunately, even though this can focus down to about 11 inches, it can not mount the flash ring because it has a 72mm filter size instead of the 67 mm on the other lenses which can use the ring flash. This is really a shame too, because at close distances, the wide field of view of this lens will cast a shadow from the built in flash on the camera that may take up 1/8 of the picture. Using a flash off the camera for closeup work is one option, a bounce flash and a card is another option, but direct lighting will alsmost certainly show up in the picture due to the wide viewing angle.Outside during daylight the lens really shines. I used it to take a photo of my house from the curb and got the entire lot (75' wide) from 50 feet away on the sidewalk, with the grass in front in focus, as well as the sky above, and parts of my neighbor's homes. This would give a realator alot of flexibility to either zoom in or crop the picture in photoshop for a front on view for flyers."
I found these at the Family Dollar for only five bucks after my HS520's bit the dust. I wasn't sure what to expect, they looked nice in the package but since they were only five dollars they were going to not sound good.Wow, I was really shocked on the sound of these! They don't sound fantastic like my HS520 pair but they do sound pretty good, especially for only $5. These have decent bass, very good mids, and decent treble. These are also very comfortable--I can wear these for hours without any discomfort. The cord is pretty mid-sized at about four feet, pretty much a factory basic. They also feel like they can put up to a lot of abuse.For only $5, they're a steal!
This is the most popular DV camcorder with indie filmmakers and aspiring film school students from rich families. Excellent, broadcast-quality image captured by the 3-CCD system. I don't use zoom or pan or special effects much, so I wish I didn't have to pay for these features, but this is still a GREAT price for such a high-quality video camera. This is absolutely the one to get for professional-level videos. Of course, if you want more resolution for sharper images, try the new affordable JVC HDTV camcorder for about the same price, I think.
The iPod first appeared four years ago, and the features continue to grow, with each update.The iPod with video playback was introduced on October 13, 2005. However, one should not necessarily consider this player a video player, but a great iPod music player, with video capabilities as a fantastic bonus. Nevertheless, the iPod with video playback is the most capable and feature-rich iPod ever produced by Apple.Video Playback - The iPod plays back H264 and MPEG4 encoded video. The iPod's new display is larger than ever at 2.5 inches, giving it a resolution of 320x240. What video content can you play on your iPod? This area is limited, at least currently. You can buy music videos on iTunes at $1.99 per song, which will play beautifully on the iPod. Furthermore, Apple has made available select television shows, for download on iTunes. They cost $1.99 per episode, for titles including ABC's hits Lost and Desperate Housewives. You can also watch the episodes you purchase on your computer. If you want to put some of your own video, onto your iPod, you will need to use an application such as QuickTime Pro to convert the video to the specific requirements to play on the iPod. You can also find video podcasts, which will play on the new iPod. Even if you do not plan to view video on the new iPod, its primary purpose is to be used as the world's best music player. You can still benefit from the beautiful new display, for it will help you find your favorite music faster, and you can view the album art that accompanies your music.Size of new iPod - Does the picture of the new iPod make it appear larger to you? Well, it did to me. The iPod looked wider, in the photos I saw. However, it is not. The height and width of the iPod are identical to the previous generation iPod with click wheel. The only change in dimensions is the depth. The new iPod is actually thinner than what came before it! Yes, this 30 gig iPod is thinner than the previous 20 gig photo model by 30 percent. What does all this mean? The iPod continues get smaller, making it even easier to carry.Capacity - This 30 gig iPod has room, for a lot of entertainment. With storage, for up to 7,500 songs, 12,000 photos, or 75 hours of video. The great thing I love about my iPod is that my music, photos, and video only take up about 15 gigabytes. However, I use the additional space to backup data, from my computer. This is incredibly helpful, and could be a real saver, if something happened to your computer. See, the iPod functions as an external hard drive, so you can backup all sorts of data. The 60 gig version is available, for $100 more, so if you want to use it for lots of video, or you have an enormous music collection, you may want to consider that larger version, which also sports longer battery life.New Software Features - Apple has added features, to the new iPod besides video support. First, they have a clock feature, which quickly allows you to view the time, in up to four different time zones simultaneously. Furthermore, there is a stop watch, and a screen lock, which you can enable to keep people from snooping on your calendar and/or contacts.Battery - The battery life is one of the most important specifications that you, as an iPod user, are going to care about. This 30 gigabyte iPod sports a battery that will last up to 14 hours, when playing only music. Also note that repeatedly changing songs manually, and turning on the backlight will use up your battery considerably faster. Furthermore, the iPod's battery lasts a maximum of two hours, when playing back video. This version of the iPod no longer includes an adapter to charge the iPod, at an electrical outlet. You will have to buy that adapter separately, or always charge the iPod via USB 2.0. The charging works fine, from your computer's USB 2.0, but if you're traveling you might want the ability to charge, with the adapter. Also note that the iPod no longer supports syncing via firewire cable. You will have to use USB 2.0.Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. The iPod syncs your contacts, video, and music via the iTunes software.Podcasting - The iPod continues to support podcasting. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, for this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box. There are also video podcasts, so with the new iPod, you will be able to watch video podcasts, on the iPod's display.Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. The new iPod is available in a black or white finish. The black color is quickly becoming the most popular, but the white iPod is still the signature color. Do note that the black may show fingerprints and scratches more than the white iPod, much as a black car shows these blemishes more than a lighter colored car.Audiobooks - I'm always using my iPod, to listen to audiobooks. You can store literally hundreds of audiobooks on here that you buy from iTunes, or Audible. The iPod even has a feature that can slow down or speed up the reading of the audiobook, so that you hear it at just the right pace.Output - The iPod connects to your PC or Mac via the dock connector at the bottom of the unit. You will connect the included cable, to the computer via a USB 2.0 port. Furthermore, accessories are being made that will also connect to the bottom dock port, and you may purchase Apple's Universal iPod dock, for easy syncing to your computer. The dock (available separately) also includes s-video output, so you can show off slideshows and video, on a television. There are also iPod A/V cables available that allow composite video and audio output, for connecting your iPod to your television. This might interest you, not only to display slideshows on a television, but also to display TV shows or music videos on a television, which you purchased from iTunes.Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Enjoy your iPod experience.
The Canon Pixma iP3000 printer is, simply put, an excellent combination of great printing quality, unbelievable speed (for an inkjet) and family-friendly affordability.After years of making dye-based printers, Canon is now making inkjet printers. The advantage of ink over dye is ink-printed photos will not fade over time, at least not as fast as dye. Color ink formula has improved a lot over the last three years, to the point that they will stay vibrant for many years to come. (Of course, only time will tell whether ink photos will last forever.")The boxy iP3000 is not a beauty to behold, but impresses everyone in the family with its excellent image quality (very good for text, excellent for photos) and fast speed. With our old Epson printer it used to take five minutes to print a photo at 150dpi in fine mode. With the iP3000, that was cut down to less than a minute and a half, and the same picture looked better this time around, too. Yes, for those of us environmentalists, the printer can print double-sided. Whether that tends to wear down the paper feed mechanism is unknown. So far, at least it hasn't had a paper jam. (Knock on wood.)One of the best things about Canon printers (except the much cheaper iP1500) is they use individual ink tanks, and the replacement tanks are fairly priced, so there's no need to buy a new cartridge to replace all the colors when only one runs out. The iP3000 is also quieter than my Epson and HP.This holiday season, if you want a family-friendly, high-quality printer, the Pixma iP3000 is by far the best choice. It strikes the perfect balance between function+quality and price."
These speakers by Polk produce wonderful sound that I can't complain about in the slightest! I have had these for about four months now; and although I could have spent more on speakers the sound that comes out of these really couldn't be that much better. The setup was not particularly hard, either.Just as quite a few others have stated, the sound is impeccable. The bass comes through just as it should and the overall clarity of the sound is perfect.The only caveat I can think of is that these are somewhat tall floorstanding speakers. Actually, they stand at just under three feet! At first they looked a bit too tall compared to my relatively small receiver and turntable; but that became completely meaningless after I heard the sound coming out of them!I highly recommend these speakers by Polk. You can't go wrong!
The green 11 filter helps mostly for lightening dark green foilage (brush, grass, etc) against a dark background. It will pass more green and attenuate red/orange and blue tending to darken the sky.For forensic documentation, alot of glow phosphors are green - such as a spectrum analyzer or tritium tubes. This filter helps to highlight the green emissions from those phosphors against the background. The camera can be changed to B&W; mode or left in color depending on the intent of the shot.With a bulb exposure tracks left by a green laser pointer are highlighted and show up almost as handwriting (with practice this can make unique shots). When using the green pointers for night sky exposures, the green filter aids in showing the beam pointing to a star especially against the dark sky.
Pretty good and comfy for this price. Sound quality can't compare to my expensive Bose QuietComfort, but at 1/10th the price, the Panasonic is an excellent value. If you have been able to live with inexpensive headphones/earphones, this upgrade will make your music-listening life more enjoyable without spending a fortune.
Fuji makes a very reliable blank CD-R that can handle up to 80 minutes of music or 700 megabytes of data. Moreover, these blank CD-Rs are capable of recording data at high speeds--48x! The data I record onto these CD-Rs has now lasted quite a while--over a year at least--proving the test of time. I have used these as data discs and discs to record audio. I almost never got a coaster. Great!The CD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data or music onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your CD-Rs that have anything stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than the packaging advertises (48x). This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your CD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink will eventually seep through the top coating of the CD-R disc; and this will slowly but surely compromise your data. If you need to label the discs, label its' jewel case using a post-it note.Overall, Fuji blank CD-R discs store data reliably and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at the very highest speed advertised.Use them in good health!
This drive is pretty good. I've burned a heck a lot of CDs that I love to listen to. It doesn't just burn CDs, it also plays them too. I like this drive, and it's nice to have two CD drive as well. But don't get confused, it doesn't read software or games, just music.I've had it for 2 years and the burning process is failing more often. Sometimes I hear this click-click-click noises sometimes while burning CDs, but it's only been happening on two brands of CD-Rs (Sony and Imatation), but I personally use Memorex and Maxell and they burn and play just fine in the Buslink drive (usually). Anyway, I surely recommend this Buslink drive because it's lasted already more than two years (got it Decmember of 2002), and the burn is very fast with 52x speed and 24x speed for re-writes.
The iPod has been an extreme success over the past two years and it seems no matter what competition comes in, Apple is still going to win.This is the second edition of the iPod mini. It still has the same, durable, and fashionable design, and the easy click wheel to navigate from music to the calendar to the games.The battery life is up to 18 hours, which is excellent. Some other MP3 players won't even last 5 hours, which is pretty lame becuase you need (or as I'm agreed with) at least 5 hours of playback.The sound quality is very decent. Not the best sound quality, but still has bass and clear treble to it.The price has been lower to $199, but still, the price seems a bit overpriced...as most 4 GB MP3 players are lower priced.Another big drawback is that the AC adapter and the FireWire cable is unincluded. THis means you need to pay an extra $50 for these needed accessories. Also, the iPod Mini can ONLY be used with iTunes, though, iTunes is a nice software, if you haven't used it before, re-iding your tracks will become a pain.Also, as most people know, all iPods are FM tuner free. This is poor because 80% of MP3 players out now have some tuner in it.Overall, the iPod may not have FM tuner, the decent sound, stylish design, game features, and a strong battery life to be happy about. If you really careless about a radio tuner, and have some cash on hand, the iPod Mini is a fantasic choice.
This Walkman by Sony offers music lovers the opportunity to listen to music files stored on a CD-R, a regular CD (of course), a CD-RW--AND there's even a digital AM and FM radio tuner! While this lacks certain features that a music aficionado might want (like the ATRAC system that some CD players have), this Walkman is really a very good choice for most people including myself. I have more than one Walkman but this is the one I use most often for when I am on the go;" it's the one I don't mind if it accidentally gets a little bit banged up over time.You can preset up to twenty FM stations and you can preset up to 10 AM stations--but this won't pick up AM stations very well unless they're located relatively close to where you are. However, that's still good for this price range. This Walkman uses two AA batteries and you get a good amount of play time out of the batteries if you pick good ones. It weighs barely more than seven ounces--great!At first glance the controls on the Walkman itself appear slightly confusing but after about five minutes tops you learn all the important and most commonly used functions. The controls also make it easy to do basic things such as adjusting the sound, starting a CD and stopping it. The instruction manual is fairly clear as well. The Walkman does have "playback modes" but I rarely use them so I can't comment on that.Unfortunately, I noticed some disappointments. The controls are rather small so you need to be careful of how you touch them with your fingers. Finally, this type of ear phone set hurts my ears almost from the very start of listening to a CD on this Walkman. I strongly suggest you purchase a better quality headset or earphones that will be more comfortable. (I have to take off one star for that--sorry!)Overall, music lovers will be very pleased with this affordable Walkman. The features work reliably. The quality of the sound is excellent; and it can handle quite a few presets for different radio stations."
Excellent product - works exactly the same as the Epson brand. I counted the pages and I got approximately the same number of pages. No clogups in fact, I believe I cleaned the heads less than I had to with the genuine replacement cartridge.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Memorex 256MB CompactFlash Memory Card, like most 256MB cards, will store on average 284 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 213 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 128 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 102 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 80 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
(I reviewed this model's little sibling, the 27 model, but both use the same video engine and are identical in feature and quality. I hope my review can help you somewhat.)Syntax Group is an Asian company that has recently entered the LCD market here stateside. Its first offerings of LCD TVs are already getting positive reviews from users. ExtremeTech (a PC Mag offshoot) recently reviewed the 30-inch LCD TV and gave it an 8 out of 10. I also found other positive independent online reviews, so I decided to give this new brand a try, and got the 27-inch model after landing a new job.Wow! I was very impressed with the image quality of this LCD TV. I had seen "low-cost" LCD TVs from Westinghouse (at Best Buy) and Gateway (at one of the now-defunct Gateway Country stores), and they were disappointing in contrast and image quality. The Syntax Olevia, despite its silly name, is definitely the best I've seen for this price class. Of course, if you take a Sharp Aquos or a Panasonic LCD TV side-by-side with the Olevia, the Sharp and Panasonic will be much better, giving you a more vibrant image, but they also cost almost twice as much as the Olevia! If you are absolutely into the best LCD quality, you have to get a Sharp; they are just the best. But if you want value but don't want to sacrifice too much in quality, this is probably the best balance.The Olevia is also generous in terms of video inputs. You also get DVI, something a lot of LCD TVs omit. The VGA port means you can use this as a computer monitor, but I haven't tried that yet. The native scan supports 720p and the internal scaler allows you to view 1080i programs as well. Hooked up to a progress-scan DVD player, the Olevia makes movies a joy to watch.In summary, the Olevia is a great entry-level LCD TV. If 27" is a bit too small for you, go for the 30" model which costs just $400 more. Syntax is also coming out with bigger screens later this year."

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The IBM 512MB CompactFlash Card, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

I bought these earbuds for my CD player (at the time) because the ones I had before died on the right side. They were a pair of RCA behind the neck headphones I bought at Family Dollar for very cheap. I would buy another pair but now I have an iPod and want to buy mostly earbuds and clip headphones that are more portable. I was planning on buying a pair of Philips earbuds at Target because (I thought) these were dead on the right side and I dislike the iPod earbuds, but when I plugged these into my iPod they worked fine. After a break-in session they sound even better.Well, they are only ten bucks, so what can you expect? Not a ton, not a surround soundstage and great, powerful sound, but maybe something that has at least average sound, are comfortable, and will last a decent amount of time. And thatt's mostly what I got with these earbuds.They don't have stellar sound (that for some reason a ton of reviews rave about), but they have decent sound that's good enough for the money. Not a lot of bass, but some pairs at this price have barely any bass. The mids on this pair are emphazised (but not by a lot, props to Sony). And they do have a good, clean sound to them, so even if you are unhappy with the low end of these earbuds you at least have a good upper end.For other aspects of the earbuds, they are very comfortable and fit much better than the Apple earbuds, but feel better with the pads. I have already lost the pads but still fit fine and are still comfortable for long periods of time. Also, these are some durable headphones so far, and after a half-year of use they still put up nicely.Overall, not a bad pair of esrbuds for portables. Already got a better pair? Keep these for some useful back-ups. They don't have amazing sound, but are comfortable and last long enough to make them worth the price. 4 stars.NOTE: This version has a volume control remote, and may be a better deal over the MDRE828LP earbuds if you want a remote for your portable device.
While Panasonic and Fuji also make very reliable flash memory cards, Lexar is the only one that makes reliable AND affordable products. I use Lexar flash memory a lot each and every day, and have never encountered an error. 512MB is perfect for the new 10-megapixel SLR digital cameras. Hmm, actually you'll need this much storage. :)Also works well in the Toshiba e755 Pocket PC. 512MB = over 15 hours of music encoded in 64-kbps WMA.
This safe screen is great, it protects from anything, comes with free cleaner and squeegee, and is very easy to put on. great job!
Ok - you're all set to record an interview. Your interviewer has one radio lapel mic and their subject has been mic'ed with your backup radio mic on a different frequency, but they have the mic way too close to their mouth and dwarf the interviewer. You have a stereo shotgun mic on your hotshoe mount for B-roll footage and you're ready to go.....Except for the fact you have 3 microphone sources and your camcorder has one stereo mic input - plus your two radio mics have different output levels causing one channel to clip occasionally as your two radio mics have unequal levels and you must unplug everything to use your shotgun stereo mic, which isn't easy to do with today's tiny cameras.That's where this comes in. There are 4 jacks and 3 sliders on this compact product just slightly bigger than a DV tape in its case.You have inputs 1 and 2 which are left and right mono inputs great for radio mics, each with their own amplitude slider to get your levels equalized and bring two separate mono sources to a stereo output. Input 3 is a stereo input for a stereo microphone that you might use in shooting b-roll footage. If you want to kill it from the interview mix, just slide the volume for mic 3 all the way down and its gone. You can also mix in some of the ambient sound with a touch of the 3rd slider.Sure it would be nice to have a mixing board on the back of your hand strap to manage audio, right? This is the only product I could find that even comes close. The next step is a 4 channel audio production set which dwarfs the size of most camcorders today. On the back of this case is a clip which can be rotated 90 degrees into 4 positions to clip onto anything and hold on tight.Since everything is passive and well shielded noise is not an issue, but be sure your mics are powered (most video cameras want separately powered mics anyways, even if it is a button cell in the mic case). The very low output from unpowered dynamic capsules won't do as well as a condenser mic with a button cell inside giving you 7mv RMS or so of output.The mixer comes with 2 cables, a mono-stereo and a stereo-stereo to connect it's 4th jack (stereo mic mix out) to your camera's stereo external mic in. All jacks are 3.5 mm, 1&2 are mono, 3&4 are stereo (with 4 being the mix output and 3 being the stereo mic in)This is a great accessory for anyone with more than one mic in use on a portable camera and at the price it's a very affordable solution for the convenience in setup it offers. If you have ever cursed that your camera doesn't have 3 mic-inputs with knobs for each, then this is the next best thing, and easier to use while shooting than the camera's controls.There is one really minor negative that won't affect most users - being a passive device not requiring a battery, this mixer will not output a signal higher than the input signals from your sources. If used with powered mics this is not a problem, but really low level outputs will be low level going into your camera. If you know you want to record a weak signal (say an electric guitar) you'll want a pre-amp to go on that signal. You can attenuate strong signals down with this to get equality.My unit stays with my 2 radio mics and receivers in their case and gets used every time I hook up external mics to my camera. It is a clean and lightweight solution to a messy cable problem in the field. I give it 5 stars because it handles most everything in an elegant simple manner with a minimum number of parts and is designed for today's smaller HD camcorders. Form definitely follows function in the product design.
This is just what I was looking for. This case fit my iPod Video 30GB perfectly, love the light weight of the case. I would highly recommend this.
When I purchased the CV123 combo pack (which buy the way isn't even close to worth buying), these headphones were part of the pack. As for as sound goes, it's average. It's pretty flat, no really big bass or good treble, but it's not terrible. They are also very comfortable, and aren't too big. The durability is pretty poor, however. They don't last very long so buy two or three. But for barely above a dollar, these are a definite buy. If they were more expensive then say five dollars, then I'd go for some Sonys.
Wearable on the keychain, the new Lexar USB 2.0 Jumpdrive is a 256MB flash memory drive that works on both USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 interfaces. If you use Windows 2000 or XP, you don't even need to install any drivers; it's true plug-n-play. The transfer speed is good, although you won't get 480 Mbps on USB 2.0 due to bottlenecks with flash technology and the actual interface. But that's not a complaint at all since the speed is comparable to hard disk-based drives. And best of all, you don't worry about any moving parts being broken. Ultra-portable, high-quality, fast... I'm happy with my Jumpdrive, until the 1GB version comes out. :)

I must be a battery charger junkie. I bought my first NiCd battery charger when they first came out, and I still remember how big and awesome-looking it was. And it charged two AA NiCd batteries in, oh, 24 hours. Then the batteries would run down after about 5 hours in my Walkman. Those were the good old days.Anyway, nowadays I must have more than half a dozen battery chargers. What I like about the Kodak Rapid Charger is it does a very reliable job of charging four NiMH batteries in a few hours. The exact charge time depends on (i) AA or AAA, (ii) how many batteries, (iii) how much charge is left in the batteries, (iv) the total capacity of the batteries (e.g., 1600 vs. 2400),(v) room temperature, and (vi) random factors that even the electrical engineers don't have a clue about. Suffice it to say that a fresh set of 4 AA batteries will charge in about 3 hours, give or take half an hour. Much better than the overnight chargers.Also, compared to my Radio Shack stock rapid charger, the Kodak can charge any number of batteries, up to four, whereas the Radio Shack must do four. The Kodak also seems to trickle charge better, because on the same set of batteries, I seem to get longer life out of a charge down on the Kodak than on the Radio Shack. My other chargers are Ravoyac which I like the most, but the Kodak is also a good, and it cost less than a comparable Rayovac I was looking at.Anyway, this is a solid battery charger for AA and AAA batteries.

This is my first PDA, but it won't be my last. It's the perfect starter PDA, and has all of the PALM functions people have come to know and love -- addresses, to-do lists, downloadable features like New York Times front page, CNN and Sports Illustrated. I've even put a free map of my county on my PDA from Mapopolis.com (a must if you haven't tried it! Streets are searchable). Also, make sure you add Vindigo, a city guide that gives restaurant and movie reviews.The Handspring also has the best features for the money. It has a bigger screen than the m105 (which I returned after a week), expandability (which I have yet to use, although I long for the GPS attachment from Magellan -- maybe when it drops to $... on clearance?)That said, I only give the Visor Deluxe four stars because it does have some significant shortcomings.One is bulk. It's significantly larger than the Palm V, which is $... more, and also requires new batteries after about two weeks of relatively heavy usage. It still fits in my chest pocket, though. The Palm V has a lithium rechargeable, and the new Palm 500 has an even better battery, but why pay $... for what is still basically, at heart, an appointment calendar?BTW, I am a newspaper reporter who previously had four Rolodexes on my desk. No longer. No longer do I misplace names, numbers, or dates. This thing has changed and organized my life in ways I didn't expect -- just ask my wife.It's basically an extension of your brain -- now isn't that worth $...?
At last, Palm gets it right -- A high quality, low price PDA with all the features you need, and none you don't. This is quite simply, a beautiful piece of engineering, and whether you are new to PDAs or upgrading, you will not be disappointed...For a bargain price of 200 smackers, Palm provides the following key features:1) A top-notch, large, hi-res screen (check it out in a store first). Many previous Palms have skimped on the screen -- a big no-no in my book. I'd much rather have a slower processor than an unreadable (m505) or too-small screen (Zire, m100). Pointing and clicking on a Palm is hard enough without having a small, dark screen to boot.2) Generous 32 MB Ram. Finally, Palm stops skimping on this important area! It's not enough to make you ditch your iPod, but you can play a few tunes, look at a few pictures, transfer some files. This is a big improvement from the bad-old 8 MB days, which is Okay for contacts but worthless for anything else.3) Rechargeable lithium polymer. Top notch. No skimping, no muss, no fuss.4) Great design. Clean, simple, portable, shirt-pocketable. No keyboard, but I've never been a thumbpad fan.5) MS Office functions included -- Word, Outlook, Powerpoint. Why you would use them, however, is a bit bizarre to me. Who wants to spend the time coding in a Powerpoint presentation with a stylus? Yet, if this is important to you, it's here. And having your email with you can be a plus...As for what you won't get: There is no phone, no camera, no thumbpad, no Bluetooth, no WiFi. This is close to a pure PDA, though it can display pictures and double as a poor-man's MP3 player. That's what I was looking for.Here's a basic product guide:New Palm Zire -- Bargain basement model with 7.2 MB of Ram, upgraded from hobbled 2 MB original model. About 100 smackers. Often offered free as bundle deals with new computers. Good starter model for the price. Includes rechargeable battery. Memory can not be upgraded. Horribly skimpy black-on-grey screen.Tungsten T2, etc.: Deluxe models that feature, in some cases, larger screens/Bluetooth wireless connectivity/thumbpads with dropdown graffiti screens. All unnecessary features in my book, especially given their much higher prices.Clie models (SJ30, etc.) recently have owned the mid-range of the Palm product line, providing color screens, style and multimedia features for less than Palm. But no longer. The Clie models simply can not compete with this new Palm -- they feel and look clunky in comparison and generally feature smaller, dimmer screens. And the upper-echelon Clie models get very expensive.Sony models also have a reputation for less-stellar customer service. (I've had excellent service from Palm.)The Treo models from Handspring/Palm should be considered if you are a thumbpad fan, or if you want your PDA to also be your phone. But let's face it, how many people can afford spending four hundred smackers on a PDA?BTW, when comparing, I've found you can generally ignore the speed of the processor. For most Palm functions, the reaction time is near instantaneous, or at most a second or two lag.As for PocketPCs, some of them are now very attractively priced and are worth checking out. I've yet to use one extensively, so I'll stick to what I know -- Palms are simple, easy to use and almost guaranteed to improve your productivity. It's like having a backup for your brain. And who doesn't need that?Enjoy!
The only issue I have with this computer is its weight. It is fast, blessed with a great screen, has every port you could possibly want, and even has a swift DVD burner to boot. But it is a behemoth at 10 pounds. The Apple 17&quot; Powerbook weighs 7 pounds, and has a longer lasting battery and a much more svelte and attractive form factor. Too bad it is 1300 clams (!) more expensive!!!Basically, this is a true desktop replacement model. And it will save you on your electric bills relative to your typical 300-watt desktop, as well as desk space...The size is sure to impress your friends, but it is almost too unwieldy and huge for couch computing, and you can forget working on it while in coach.Enjoy!
The Belkin Hi-Speed USB 2.0 15-in-1 Media Reader & Writer allows you to transfer files between your PC and flash media cards. You can also transfer files between flash cards, since they just show up as external drives (e.g., F:, G:, H:, etc.) in your Windows Explorer. The 15 supported flash formats are:1. xD Picture Card (used in Fujifilm and Olympus digicams)2. CompactFlash I3. CompactFlash II4. Microdrive (from IBM or Hitachi or Toshiba)5. SmartMedia6. Secure Digital (the most popular kind of flash)7. Mini SD (used in the latest Sanyo cell phones and various Pocket PC phones)8. Multimedia Card9. RSMMC (a smaller type of Multimedia Card that requires an adapter)10. Memory Stick11. Memory Stick PRO (higher-capacity Memory Stick)12. Memory Stick MagicGate13. Memory Stick Duo (half-sized as Memory Stick)14. Memory Stick Duo PRO15. Memory Stick MagicGate DuoAs you can see, many formats are just variants of one another. The reader/writer has four slots, so you can stick in at most four flash memory cards at a time.The reader/writer installed painlessly and started working right away, but I soon found out speed was not consistent, even when reading from or writing to the same card. I use this with Windows XP Professional SP 2. I usually get about 10-15MB/sec of performance with my external hard drives (e.g. Sony Micro Vault 5GB, Seagate 200GB USB 2.0), and with my previous Dazzle media reader/writer, I was getting around 5MB/sec on average. (I actually use a dedicated Sony Memory Stick reader/writer which I bought a while ago for my PSP, and its average speed is around 10MB/sec.)But with the Belkin -- which is powered directly by the USB port -- I get anywhere from 1MB/sec (USB 1.1 performance) to 10MB/sec. It's not a question of file size as my measurement has been normalized around that. (What I mean is, no matter what operation system you use, it takes more time to read/write a large number of small files than a small number of large files, even when the total size is the same. This is due to the way file systems handle files -- think of them as databases that must retrieve or create data entries.)This is disappointing to me, since I like predictability when it comes to performance. This is true esp. because I got this to use with my laptop to transfer pictures on-the-go. If it takes too long to transfer, my laptop's battery might run low or I might be in a hurry to board a flight. Anyway, while the overall performance of the Belkin is tolerable, I'm disappointed.But it still deserves 4 stars because it's small, stylish, and installs easily. And it does accommodate pretty much all the different kinds of flash memory you can find. If you need a versatile media reader/writer, this is worthy of a look.
This CD tower by Atlantic holds 40 CDs in their jewel cases. It is compact and it's certainly no eyesore. I used this rack to store CDs when I had a much smaller collection of CD and I was satisfied.Another wonderful feature of this CD storage tower is that it requires no assembly. This comes in handy for persons like me who are all thumbs." It can be stored just about anywhere, too--at 15 inches high this storage tower is compact while doing the job of storing your CDs in an orderly and presentable fashion.The rack is constructed of black wire with "cherrywood" accents. Caution: at this price you shouldn't expect real wood knobs. The "cherrywood" knobs look somewhat like fake wood or laminate. This is a minor disappointment, however.My only complaint is that the CD jewel cases often slide to one side or the other as they rest in their slots in this storage tower. Unless you are rather careful the CDs eventually look a bit disorderly; but again this is a minor complaint and it may not bother you.Overall, if you want an inexpensive CD storage rack for smaller CD collections, this is the way to go. It is affordable, requires no assembly and lasts forever. Get one and use it in good health!"
Embedded Mac OS and Windows 2000, Windows XP driver support, Plug 'n' Play without driver installation compact size for portability with Anti shock design.
The device was easy to set up and install. Pc will recognize it right away and ready to go. I would highly recommend it!
The case is great. And well priced! Highly recommend getting one of these..especially if don't have any protection plan on the iPod nano, and cant afford to break it. In short,Excellent Deal!
Tablet PC has been out almost a year now and is slowly gaining momentum in the corporate world. For the average consumer, though, I think it's still way over-priced and under-equipped in terms of software. In short, the Tablet PC platform is still largely a vertical market product.That said, having a Tablet PC does give the gadget freak a few cool things to enjoy. For example, scratch on a pad to your heart's full content. Not enough? How about watching a DVD movie at any angle you wish? Still want more? You can lie on your stomach and surf the web, you geek!The Protege 3505 is arguably the sleekest and strongest TPC on the market right now. It's a hybrid model with a keyboard which turns it into a notebook. Compared to the lower-rung 3500 model, the 3505 has more memory (512 vs. 256) and also comes with an external DVD drive. It has wi-fi built-in (along with Ethernet and IR), and depending on the specific configuration, you can opt for built-in Bluetooth as well.Performance is solid from the P3-M processor. You should know that the TPC version of Windows XP is optimized for the processors so you actually get a lot of performance at &quot;low&quot; clock speeds. (&quot;Low&quot; compared to desktop P4s; if you compare with Power PC G3 or G4's, these are still &quot;fast&quot;.) I certainly have no problem playing MP3s in the background while running a few Excel Solver analyses; the OS remains totally responsive.Battery life is average for TPCs, but weight is where Toshiba can improve. On the other hand, this is an affordable TPC, so you have to ask yourself which of the two (weight vs. price) is more important to you. Fujitsu's Tablet PCs are better built and only slightly less sleek, but their battery life is not as good as Toshiba while costing more. Sorry, still no perfect TPC yet.Should you get your Amazon Visa card out and order one right now? I'd say no. There isn't much software included, and the novelty factor wears off quickly, plus 4.1 pounds (not counting the external DVD) is a lot to carry. On the other hand, if your company pays for it, it's another story.
Ordered this through Amazon from Eforcity"...got here very quickly for a VERY good price compared to a new one from Apple. Seems to work great so far, seems to be a very good quality adapter."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Smart Modular 128MB COMPACT FLASH CARD, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I bought this item form Eforcity. Fast Shipment!. This cable provide the high quality with my new HDTV. And the price of the cable is not expenscive.
Excellent ink cartridge!It is a best ink cartridge for me to replace the original canon cartridge. I highly recommend this product.

When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.Storage - This is the new 1 GB version of the iPod Nano. Apple released the 1 GB version, to have an entry-level nano priced at only $150. You get all the features of the 2 & 4 GB models, but simply less storage for songs. If having less songs to carry around is ok with you, save some money with this player.Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.
UPDATE - I bought this 12/07 and it's now 08/09. Amazon is selling a remote faceplate along with the prosine inverters. YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY IT. The inverters come with a built in faceplate and 4 screws - remove the screws and insert a male-female modular phone cable to extend the remote control to wherever you want it. Amazon did remove the cautions about generators, so I am removing my paragraph about the difference in generators and inverters. My pro-sine 1000w nominal, 1500w peak has proven to be as reliable as a power outlet in my home, and in analyzing the power quality with fluke tools it is equal to or better than the power from the grid, which says alot.Note - when this was written the price was $549 and was the best deal on the net. Amazon has raised their price but the Xantrex prosine series is still in the top tier of inverters. Also note that Amazon's description makes reference to a staged charger - the prosine series HAS NO CHARGER and is reliant upon an external charger (alternator, AC, or solar etc) so amazon should correct their description. I later purchased a D31M Optima battery and a 1.5 Farad capacitorOptima Batteries OPT D31M Group 31 Marine Battery, BlueTopPOWER ACOUSTIK 1.0 FARAD Digital Power Capacitor (POWER ACOUSTIK PC10F)to improve the surge performance of this inverter for starting an air compressor. I also added a 50 foot 10/3 extension cord to use with it so that power would not be wasted in the extension see:Coleman Cable 10/3 50-Foot Vinyl Outdoor Extension Cord #02688-88-02Updated 1/2008. Using these add-ons makes a very functional 1000W continuous inverter with 1500 watt surge capability that operates in my car and doesn't complain what I operate from it.(paragraph wondering why amazon put generator info on this product now removed - it is not a generator - it converts 12 volts DC from a battery or car alternator to 117 VAC with a true sinewave output that won't damage delicate appliances)PROS:Lets start positive: Inverters are almost silent. They make a very very slight buzzing sound on the poor quality models, but a true sine wave inverter is almost completely silent except for cooling fans which only come on under high power use and turn off when it is cold outside or you are running a transformer adapter)A true sine wave is just like the power that comes from the utility. A modified sine wave is squared off without round corners - this causes heat generation in alot of electronic devices and can blow fusses even blow transformers. For those non-electricians it's like using square tires on a car meant for round tires! I have used alot of modified sine wave inverters in my time - they are much smaller, much cheaper, and tend to DESTROY your expensive electronics. That is why I bought a TRUE sine wave inverter - the power is just like what comes from the wall socket, but you pay more for the inverter and get less power out. It's a tradeoff that can save your valuable electronic parts. For me, this one will drive > $250,000 in Agilent test and measurement gear in my truck, so $549, which is the best price around, is cheap! (revised: 1/08 not any more - several companies sell it for 599) revised 08/09 - now they are $750 - inflation.OK - more pros - the Xantrex brand comes with a nice LCD display showing volts, amps, and watts. This display can be removed and relocated in your vehicle with a simple telephone cord for $5. REVISED - YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY THE SEPARATE CONTROL PANEL - JUST RELOCATE THE BUILT IN ONE using a phone cord. No exposed printed circuit boards are present and the remote display is self contained as it comes from the factory. Other higher wattage Xantrex sinewave inverters do not include this display and sell it optionally for $400 alone. Some sites advertise the display board as an optional item. I don't know why - it comes with the inverter in the 1000/1800 watt variant. Cheaper brands have red/green lights on the front that are permanent. Like a fine auto, guages are essential to proper operation to know when your battery is dying or if you have a bad connection somewhere. The LCD display shows Volts, Amps, and has a bargraph showing your instantaneous wattage including surge to 1500 watts.You should know the two prosine models (1000/1800 watt continuous) each come in 3 models - version 1 is hardwired for an RV by an electrician (no GFCI, conduit fittings in/out), version 2 is hardwired with an auto switchover when AC is present (just like a UPS but meant for LONG runtimes), and ver. 3 has a GFCI outlet on the front panel to just plug into but no AC connection at all. This model is the 3rd variant. You give it a 12VDC source and it gives you 1000 watts (1500 surge watts for a few seconds to start lights, motors, and such). Keep in mind that to get 1500 surge watts, you need 150 amps at 11 or so volts. That is not going to come from the cigarette lighter - this must be installed with heavy wire going to a top of the line battery as startup currents for some devices may be 130+ amps. Motors and incandescent lights can draw as much as 10x their operating power at startup, which is why a good inverter gives you both max and surge values.Also use caution when buying any inverter - advertising will push the surge" value which may be for only 1/2 second on some models (about 3 seconds on this one). Your real operating power is the lower number.If you want one of the other models they are more expensive and you can add features later if you really need them, but its not an easy task. Odds are you don't need these features but if you think you do, this is the wrong model - it is the entry level model w/o all the features. There is also an 1800 watt version available for more money. I bought this because of the value at the $549 pricepoint. Today I'd probably buy the 1800 watt model as the prices are closer. Everyone else is $680. (note prices are higher now)Another "PRO" of this is the xantrex inverter has a power down (sleep) mode where it will wake up every 2.5 seconds and look for a load connected to it - if there is no load of 10 watts or more (i.e. lights are turned off) then it goes back to sleep for 2.5 seconds. In this mode it only uses 1.5 watts from your batteries. It's very efficient this way to not drain your batteries if you turn off your load when it is not in use. Idiling (running the inverter without a load) takes about 22 watts instead of 1.5 watts in sleep mode. You can turn sleep mode on or off if you want full power 100% of the time. In sleep mode you will notice the NEON lights of your power strips blink every 2.5 seconds during sleep mode - that is the inverter searching for a load to run.Another design pro is the LCD dot matrix display can be removed and extended from the chassis for remote mounting (i.e. keep the inverter near your batteries and put the monitor near the drivers seat in an RV). I used a $5 phone extention cable to do this. If you plan to use it in a vehicle look into battery isolation modules - these allow your batteries to charge while driving and drain your EXTRA batteries with the inverter while not draining your engine starting battery (kinda important!) - I used a system like this to run an electric heater in my truck camper in the nevada winter - batteries charge during they day while driving and keep the truck warm at night, even running cooking tools for dinner.Back to the inverter, now let's address the cons.One sorta con and sorta pro is that the inverter is air cooled. The fan is VERY fast. Under light loads (50 watts or so) it doesn't even run the fan. As soon as you run 1000 watts (ex: printing on a laser printer) it runs the fan at full speed. In between it runs slower to minimize noise. It's a good compromise between needlessly running the fan and quickly cooling the inverter under heavy load.Another con is that "TRUE SINE" inverters are not as efficient as "Sorta Sine" inverters are. In a perfect world if we need 1 amp at 120V, it will take 10A at 12 V to get it. Due to the fact that this not a perfect world, it's more like 14A at 12VDC to get 1A at 120VAC. Because this inverter can make 8.3A @ 120V (8.3A x 120V ~= 1000W neglecting the power factor which is beyond this review's scope - google "power factor" to understand it.) You need 8.3 * 12-14A at 12VDC. That's alot of amps, over 100 amps give or take the efficiencies and surges. YES IT TAKES >100 amps at 12VDC if you want 1000 watts out! This means HEAVY wire to your batteries. Notice I said batteries. You can wire more than one in parallel (all positves touch, all negatives touch, AND *NO* positive touches any other battery negative such as in 24V battery systems) and you can divide the load - 2 batteries in parallel and your 100 amps is only 50 amps per battery. With 4 it's only 25 A per battery. Think lots of matching batteries. A hidden "PRO" here is that the connector for the heavy cables is up to the task and won't fry when you run 100+ amps through it for hours at a time. Most inverters lack such a heavy duty connector. This unit can run 1000 watts continuous which means 100 amps continuous - be sure your wiring is up to the task or it may melt. You'll want #2 to #2/0 cable to wire this up which is between $2-$8/foot.This is simple power conversion theory and regretably there isn't anything you can do about it except add more batteries to your battery array if you intend to pull 1000 watts for an extended time. If you seldom need the full 1000 watts or 1500 watt surge rating, then you can use smaller wire, but keep the runs short.There is alot to like about the Xantrex design. If the only thing you ever intend to run is an incnadescent light and a computer, then the cheaper "sorta sine wave" inverters (they have many names but are not "TRUE" sine wave designs) will work fine, but don't use a modified sine wave to run any of the following "delicates":+ wall warts (with transformers - they burn up from harmonics+ microwave ovens (they have transformers too and use alot of power)+ VCRs / DVDs / HiFi (clocks will be wrong and you'll get audio buzz)+ some TVs (some do work on square wave but with shortened life span)+ expensive stuff (is it worth it? Save a couple hundred and ruin it?)+ clocks (they see time going by twice as fast without a pure sine wave)+ flourescent lamps (the coil ballast types get really hot and blow their fuse on modified sine wave power)Of all the options out there for a pure sine wave, Xantrex has the best name and amazon has [revised: HAD] the best price according to froogle and pricewatch.Be sure and buy some heavy guage wire to connect the inverter unless you have a low power load. If you run 1000 watts through your cigarette lighter it will blow a fuse. If you put the wrong fuse it it will melt the wire! Run your wires to the battery.With this inverter you can take your electrical outlet with you on the road or when the power fails have a backup source until your batteries die. A deep cycle marine battery typically will run 100A for 1 hour (or 1000 watts) so you must conserve if your runtime is important or else add batteries. Either way you'll love the clean power, no buzzing, dimmers working normally, and nothing being damaged. Short of a generator, which it is NOT, it is the best way to get AC power away from the utility grid such as solar and wind power systems, off grid living, or car outlets with clean 120 VAC. Just be sure you have a way to charge your batteries - that is left up to you which is incorrectly documented about the product. Bigger Xantrex inverters do have internal chargers, but not these."
This is a basic portable CD player that features CD-R/RW playability, 35-hour playback on 2 AA batteries (even cheap ones!), 40-second anti-skip system (cannot be turned off, unlike previous basic models from Panasonic), and three-phase equalizer (normal, bass boost, train"). Of course, you can program the playlist as well as disable accidental button presses. It can play MP3s that are burned into audio CDs on CD-R/RW discs, but not MP3 files directly. No big deal since it's real easy to burn audio CDs anyway. The lid color is blue, and many people think it looks cute, but not overly so.Solid build quality, excellent sound quality (esp. on good headphones), long battery life, and ease of use make this the best basic CD player out there today. Made in Japan with a great price tag."
OK - I realize it's a sin to put Olympus cameras into a Canon bag but my video is all Canon and my stills are all Olympus - so if you shoot with the E series OLY cams, this bag has no problems with other brands.Negative - I took this on a 15 day cruise loaded with 3 E-300 backs and 3 lenses to avoid changing lenses. The only thing I would do differently is NOT use the velcro pockets on the side for ANYTHING of value. Everytime you step on or off the ship, you do the entire X-ray, cavity search, etc TSA routine. I lost alot of small stuff out of the side pockets. Their flaps let small stuff leak through the TSA security x-ray and bucket brigade.Positives. I used this solidly every day for 15 days to cary 3 ea E-300 backs, 1 50mm prime lens, 1 14-54 mm zoom, and 1 50-200 mm along with a teleconverter, 2 flashes (a long range and a ring flash), and a 300+ volt rapid recharge flash accessory for short recharge times, typically under 1/2 second. There are plenty of pockets - as I mentioned the side pockets are vulnerable to loosing contents inside Xray machines, but the main compartment is amazing. The straps that crosshatch the back did a great job holding the strobe power supply while allowing the coiled cord to exit to the strobe attachment point - it was a very effective system even allowing the rapid strobe charger to run and to stay cool while in the pack.All backs were carried mated to their associated lens - avoiding the risk of changing lenses in the field. The main camera back had the dual battery accessory on it - the two smaller ones did not and went face to face like lenses with padding. All of this, plus the macro hardware went in the main compartment. If I were not on a ship with narrow passages, I could have tied my tripod to the two straps under the main bag but I chose not to as I'd get stuck in so many tight spaces if I did. There are also two heavy mounted 1 strap ties on the sides that can be used to attach other cases to the pack.Padding is very generous inside the main compartment, so your preciuos cargo is protected against drops and mishandling by those people who keep us safe (HINT - put UV filters on all lenses before traveling - TSA likes to touch the glass on your lens to make sure its not a bomb)I was simply amazed that I could carry so much in a compact backpack, have it organized ready to pull the right camera for that quick shot, and still have every accessory needed for a full day's shooting on the run. Empty, the pack is very light and adds little weight to your overall load. The zippers are all well attached to handle some stretching - they held up well without damage. All cameras survived the trip and the bag looks good as new. It was, of course, my carry on item, so it got the most scrutiny and fingerpoking by TSA's "challenged" employees.If you are planning a trip with cameras and accessories, this *IS* the best way to make it through security and still have working equipment on the other side. I doubt you will find anything as well thought out at a camera store for this price either.I did not try fitting any video equipment in this pack as it travels in a hard pelican case. Holding 3 D-SLR cameras and all accessories speaks volumes as to its ability though. This is a keeper for traveling and just general storage."
This Philips DVD player not only looks good, weighs little, but is one super hero of a DVD player. Everything you've read or heard is true: it can play not only video DVDs, VCDs, CDs, and JPEG pictures, but can play DivX and MPEG4 files with grace. In fact, with the latest firmware, you don't even need to navigate any folder menus to play DivX files: just put in the disc and the DVP642 will automatically start playing (after about 30 seconds to a minute, though).And, yes, this player can play DVD-R and DVD-RW just fine, even though the user's manual only mentions DVD+R/RW compatibility.The user's manual is one of the better ones I've seen for a DVD player, even though it's printed in China. At least the writer could write in proper English. Best of all, this manual explains pretty much everything about the DVD player, except its video upsampling capability.The remote control is minimalistic and as other have pointed out, lacks a dedicated open button, although you can just hold down the stop button for 2-3 seconds to get the same effect.When I took this player out of the box, my significant other, who's more of an artistic bend but ignorant of technical details beyond put-in-the-disc-and-it-should-play" variety, was wowed by its super-thin profile and general good looks. This player is so good, that I'm getting a 2nd one just as a backup.Highly recommended. Cheerios.UPDATEI would have changed the rating to 4 stars, but Amazon doesn't let me. Two areas of disappointment after some heavy usage:1) The dvp642 has trouble with many VCDs that play fine on other players. A friend of mine recent returned from a trip to the Far East with dozens of VCDs. I thought I was going to have kungfu filmfest, but was disappointed that almost 25% of the VCDs couldn't play at all on the dvp642, even though they played fine (albeit with hiccups) on my Cyberhome DVD300 and even my 6-year-old Panasonic. The dvp642 is also not gracious if your DVD is scratched. This is NOT one of the more forgiving DVD players out there.2) If you have an HDTV monitor, you'll be disappointed at the image quality, or at least it didn't meet my expectations. The Denon 755S, costing just $200, gives great video quality, but the dvp642 is definitely not a "high-end" player. Its 4x upsampler doesn't seem to improve video output."
Fast SATA Drive Fan included and 7200RPM! GREAT for video,audio Internal fan makes it run cooler. Universal firmware supports all devices, automatic detection for ATA or SATA protocol
Finally a Pocket PC to please the geekiest of the geeks. With the patch provided by a kind programmer, the e805 can display VGA (640x480) in native mode, and the results are stunning. Webpages and especially Excel will look tiny, but I never use Excel on Pocket PC anyway, so to me that complaint is moot. (Obviously if you do use Excel on your PDA this is important to know.) In addition to the great screen, I also love the 805's speed, memory and built-in wi-fi. Let's not kid ourselves: this is a high-end PDA and not everyone will find it a good value. But if you want VGA, this is the only game in town, and it's a good game.
I wish people would refrain from lying; some people will do anything to defame Microsoft, a genuine, all-American company. The LifeCam VX-6000 installs easily, does not install secret non-essential software like Creative and Logitech installers do, and works beautifully with various IM clients. I tested it with different video chat programs and didn't enconter any problems on my two WinXP computers. I mainly use it with the new Windows Live Messenger (formerly known as MSN Messenger) and the video and audio quality are just superb. But I do think this might be a little too much if all you do is casual video chats. The cheaper VX-3000 is probably a better buy for most people. If you want a real digital camera, get a real one from Canon, Casio, Fuji, Nikon, Panasonic, Sony, etc. But if you do some video conferencing for business, the VX-6000 is a good investment.
Consumer Reports recently ranked Toshiba projection TV pretty highly, up there with Sony and Hitachi. I've seen a similar model in my local store and was impressed by the image quality. I think a lot of technies over-rate DLP; if you watch standard TV and DVDs I doubt you'll notice any difference between DLP and LCD-based RPTVs. LCD RPTVs from Sony and Hitachi are also getting better each day. Is DLP worth the extra bucks? It's hard to say, although I cannot deny that like plasma, DLP just sounds so cutting-edge" these days."
Somehow my order for the BX5a Deluxe 70-watt Bi-amplified Studio Reference Monitors got changed to this model. Knowing what I ordered and seeing what I got, I could see some clear advantages. When I opened these I just let my jaw drop for a second. The XLR jack was missing, replaced by TRS, which isn't a problem since its still a differential input and for most people alot more common. With 20 watts per channel instead of 70 I was somewhat concerned but high volume testing showed their amp could deliver ample power for the speaker size. The added features of internal volume w/ blue backlight on left speaker, separate ipod input (or in my case android phone), headphone output (1/8), and on the back BOTH differential (TRS 1/4") and RCA inputs made me think for a while the product has been updated. I was in second heaven - these speakers would eliminate the clutter of cables and adapters, plus the assortment of underpowered and/or oversized speaker sets that permiated my pc and mixing console. With the differential inputs hum was definitely a thing of the past. With the two single ended inputs (3.5mm and RCA) I could connect consumer grade equipment to them with ease. Overall, I double checked my shipping tag to find out I had been sent a different model, which explained all the extra features. I use TRS and XLR so either one is just as good, but the added features offered in this model made it much more attractive.Best of all - they sound great for speakers twice their size. There is no shortage of power here, if anything the amps could drive a larger speaker, but thats what you want - oversize the amp so you never go into clipping which is what ruins speakers.At full volume I did pick up some hum - but quickly found it was comming from a BD player on the RCA inputs (using tripple shielded cables only 2' long) - removing the player did not remove the hum, but removing the cables did, so your BEST sound will come from the 1/4" TRS input set (and amazon sells the HOSA adapters if need be). I work in a very strong magnetic field so hum makes its way into almost everything here.That gives you 3 inputs, and local volume control - features I would have lost on the 5a series.Minor pet peeves:The right speaker is unpowered and just a speaker, so it requires a connection to the left speaker. Factory design includes about 10 feet of 18 ga speaker wire, pre tinned, and those clever push down red/black lever terminals on both the output and input. I may install speakon Neutrik NL4FX Speakon 4 Pole Line Connector professional terminals between the speakers and use a speakon cable to be compatible with my other devices. Retrofitting is generally a cinch and I'm probably the only person who would insist on all pro connectors given the quality of these speakers - it would allow me to change to larger speakers without undoing the connections I have in place.The AC power in is polarized but ungrounded. while an IEC input might be simple to do, I think I will leave this alone since there is no exposed metal to ground to. Most of my equipment is IEC, but these are using the 2 wire input plug with one side flat and one rounded (as opposed to the double round design).NEITHER of these are issues most people will be concerned with because out of the box they sound great. I played the directors cut of miami viceMiami Vice (2006) [Blu-ray] to test them to their fullest potential on my BD player and selected the HD input on my mixing board monitor to view the video. During the loud scenes people came to see what was going on in the mixing booth.PROS:In addition to the 3 inputs mentioned above, there is a bass boost on/off (sounds to be a 10 dB rolloff filter off / on which does the same thing) if you want extra bass from these, and they have bass reflex ports on the back. The sound quality from these small speakers is amazing.Altogether this is a great product for:1 - your computer2 - your mixing panel monitor speakers3 - your entry level HTPC system4 - anywhere you need 2 extra speakers (eg a 7.1 channel system)5 - portable electronics, e.g. ipods, iphones, android phones, sanza players, etc.With the input and output capability there are very few situations you won't be able to use these amplified speakers in. Cutting down on the cable clutter alone is a major plus!I'm happy the mistake in sending me these instead of the 5a model was made. 20W per channel is more than adequate for a room speaker. Odds are you are withining 10 feet of these speakers and not trying to fill a concert hall with them."
This is an excellent network router for sharing a brodband Internet connection...you get a top-performance Ethernet router, built-in firewall, basic content control functions, and ease of set up. I was able to get it up and running in just 5 minutes. One caveat: this is a cable router, so you'll need to run cables between the router and your PCs (up to 4). If that doesn't bother you, this is the best consumer router you can get... and the price is totally sweet.
First of all, let me point out that you *CAN* simply drag-and-drop files from your Windows Explorer to the folders on the Toshiba gigabeat V. However, if you do this, you may not be able to get extra tag info such as album art.Now the review.The Toshiba gigabeta V is a portable media center player; portable media center" refers to the platform Microsoft has built for devices that can play video, audio, pictures, recorded TV, etc. The V competes with "full-sized" media centers from Creative and Archos, and it's *not* a slim, feather-weight media player like the latest iPods. On the other hand, it's got a biggish, very bright LCD screen (QVGA resolution) and a 1.8-inch shock-mounted 30GB (27.7GB reported by Windows) hard disk. Because the hard disk appears as just another external storage to Windows, you can use the V as a portable hard drive.The buttons on the V are pleasant to press and are quite intuitive. The placement of the skip and play/pause buttons (on the top) is unconventional. The V has a monoaural speaker, which I love because I can enjoy music-on-the-go together with my toddler Charlie. (I play lots of classical music to him.) The sound quality on the V is just excellent: a lot of range, and a lot of volume.With the battery, which lasts around 18 hours playing back 128kbps-encoded MP3 files in real life (and Toshiba claims up to 9 hours for video playback), the unit weighs in at 7.7 oz, so it's not lightweight, and its bulky physical size makes it just okay to fit in a men's trouser pocket, or in a jacket pocket. The styling is neat, though, and it's not something you'll ever feel embarassed about showing to your friends.What's not so good about the package is the Microsoft software that drives the thing. The portable media center on the device itself tries to be friendly and, for basic operations, it's not too bad. But when you try to do anything beyond just play/pause/power off, it gets annoying. For example, it's almost impossible to use playlists. Also, it's impossible to delete files on the device; you'll have to use Windows Explorer or Windows Media Player. Speaking of the latter, the manual says you should install the WMP 10 on the enclosed CD-ROM regardless of what WMP you already have on your PC. I already have WPM 11 on my XP computer, and no file was installed: the V played well (or as well as it could play) with WMP 11.Of course, Windows Media Player is not a totally user-friendly piece of software, despite numerous UI improvements over the versions. Sync'ing can still freeze the program, and the most annoying part of WMP is it tries to pull all media files on your hard drive together, including temporary internet files you may have downloaded. Editing tags is still a pain in the butt. After you sync, it's not entirely clear, at least not at first, how you manage the files synced to your V.But if you're willing entrust your library of music, videos and pictures to WMP, you can probably avoid worrying about the sync details. If you, like me, want to have some control over which and how files are sync'ed, you'll run into a lot of frustrating moments.Overall, the V is a good media player -- and I really like the built-in speaker feature. It lacks some features found on other players, like FM or recording, but it has a decent TV-out feature that lets you play video and audio on a TV set. The screen is gorgeous, and that makes the overall UI experience a pleasure on a day-to-day basis. Oh, did I mention the V has great sound quality? (I know it because I'm a classical music lover and demand the highest audio quality.)BTW, the V has been discontinued, which means you can find it at great prices."
I just pre-ordered the first hard drive-based camcorder, the JVC Everio GZ-MC200, after reading a full review in today's New York Times (11/25/04, available online for 30 days). The reviewer liked this over the smaller version, the MC100, and the price difference on Amazon makes the MC200 a better buy. The Times review mentioned excellent video quality (and 2MP stills) and ease of use. I'll come back with my own hands-on review after I get mine from Amazon.Happy holidays.
Another member of Sharp's unbeatable LCD TV family:1. Great LCD panel: 32 diagonal, vivid colors, stunning clarity, very good black-level quality, no dead pixels (cheaper brands often have dead pixels)2. Great styling: looks absolutely beautiful, in the living room or bedroom or your fancy bathroom3. Lots of inputs: digital inputs, component inputs, PC input. HDTV tuner is not built-in, though, so you'll need a separate HDTV tuner, which is fine since you likely need to get an HDTV cable or satellite service like VOOM anyway4. Simplicity: the set-top connector box hides all the wires5. Easy to set up and useBTW, the "32GD4U" model (with a D) has a built-in HDTV tuner, but it's also hundreds more. This present model (without the HDTV tuner) is definitely the better value."
HP Deskjet 840C PrinterThis inkjet printer is designed for the home or small office. It attaches to a computer via the classic parallel cable or to a USB port. You should connect the USB cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the printer. It can be used with Windows 3.1, 95 via parallel port, or 98, Me, and XP via USB. The black inkjet cartridge is the #15, the tricolor inkjet cartridge is the #17. The #17 tricolor cartridges is often harder to find. This printer works well for the average user. When installing the printer you may have to create a USB Virtual printer port if another printer was previously defined (not for printers connected to a parallel port).HP seems to have a policy of planned obsolescence" in manufacturing new printers that use new inkjet cartridges. Over time it becomes harder to quickly purchase replacement cartridges. If you bought a used printer you can refer to another HP printer manual for general advice. HP advises against refilling a cartridge but you may find doing this useful.The HP840C User's Guide has a Table of Contents that covers the topics in its 74 pages. Be sure to read the warnings in the manual about proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. One user had a problem with the separate power supply. It is probably not good practice to keep the printer powered on when not in use. Like other HP printers the paper path takes a U-turn in printing so the printer uses less desk space. Be sure the bottom tray is pushed against the printer body, a loose fit can cause printing problems. [I bought this at a local yard sale w/o power supply, truly a bargain.]"
(Tamron also makes this lens available for Canon and Pentax digital SLRs, for the same price.)This new digital SLR-friendly zoom lens from Tamron is a great way to acquire a high-quality zoom lens for a fraction of the cost if you bought from the camera maker (e.g., Nikkor). Tamron claims this is world's smallest and lightest" zoom lens for the focal range. I have no idea if that's true. It's small and lightweight indeed, about the same size as the DX lens bundled with the Nikon D70 but feels lighter in the hand. To my eyes it's a plastic lens, but this made-in-Japan lens looks and feels solid. It has all the bells and whistles of a modern lens: XR, LD, asperical, plus macro capability. In real world shooting I'm very happy with the result, and I really don't think buying an official Nikkor lens would make much of a difference. Two things to keep in mind is, 1) as long as you buy a namebrand lens (Tamron, Sigma, and maybe Vivitar) you are getting a good deal, and 2) the marginal increase in lens quality (perceived or real) from the camera maker is extremely unlikely to improve pictures by any discernible amount. Give Ansel Adams a disposable camera and he would still take better pics than you and me, period. As long as you have a high quality, capable lens like this Tamron, you are armed with all the gear you need to NOT miss a great picture opportunity. The only ingredient nobody can sell, is your creativity. (Unfortunately the latter is what I lack and try to improve. For now, at least the Tamron is giving me the right tool.)For digital Nikon SLRs, the 1.5 "magnification" factor (or crop factor) means the effective focal length of this Tamron is about 43-460mm in 35mm equivalent.In short, this is a really top-quality lens that any Nikon D70 enthusiast should consider. It's a lot bang for the buck, and it's even made in Japan unlike many Nikon official lenses which are made in sweatshops in Southeast Asia."
(I include real-world MP3 conversion speed below.)OK, I just couldn't help it. I'm still unemployed, but just *had* to get this hard-disk digital Walkman. The small physical size - 3.5x2 3/8"x1/2" and 3.88 oz. with the built-in LiIon battery - simply makes this a must-have for a gadget fanatic such as myself. (The Sony is really much smaller in real than in pictures.)So I went ahead and bought one. I knew this player would not play native MP3 or WMA files. I knew I'd have to convert my existing MP3 and WMA files, or even re-rip some of my favorite CDs. I was curious how good this player was and how hard the conversion would be, so I took the plunge.In one word, Sony's tiny hard-disk digital Walkman is wonderful. This is $100 more than other digital music players of the same capacity. But, alas, what you get is a stylish, high-tech gizmo that simply screams "high-end" and "superb engineering." It's a joy to hold and behold.Beyond the small size, light weight and clean styling, I was very impressed with the sound quality on this Walkman. I ripped a jazz CD and a rock CD into ATRAC3Plus at 64kbps, and was surprised to hear the richness in the sound output on my separately purchased Sony headphones. (I never use bundled earphones.) I compare-listened to the same tracks encoded in 128kbps MP3 and played on my Archos MP3 player. The sound quality was very similar. But after I turned up the bass on the Sony, I was nearly awed by the improved bass from the ATRAC files. Since 64kbps means half the file size as 128kbps, this translates into similar sound quality for half the file size.Speaking of customized EQ, the Sony has two kinds of sound effects. One set is called VX, which is virtual effects like simimulating a recording studio or a concert hall. The other set is the graphic EQ, with a few presets and two custom sets. There are six EQ bars from bass to treble. Each bar has seven settings from -3 to +3. I found that -1 to +1 sound very similar, but you'll notice the difference once you notch up or down to 2 or 3 either way.The Sony is pretty easy to figure out, although I have to say it's still not quite as dummy-friendly as iPod's deservedly famed interface. There is a four-direction round button (it does not rotate a la iPod's wheel, which I dislike). In the middle of it is the play/stop button. There is no separate pause button on the Sony. In fact, the stop button works like a pause on this player: pressing it causes the audio to stop in the middle. And after you turn off the Sony (by holding down the menu button at the top), next time you turn it on again, the track resumes from the exact stopped point. This is a convenient feature, esp. for audiobook tracks.Besides the menu button, which is used to access settings, there's a "mode" button, which lets you access the Artists, Albums, Genres, etc. lists. There's also a volume rocker at the top. I personally find the Sony's max loudness more than my ears can take, even on a noisy New York subway. You can turn on volume control in settings to keep a lid on the max volume. At the bottom player is the hold button (easier to slide than iPod's) and a battery button which allows you turn off the unit completely if you don't plan to use it for more than three months.Speaking of the battery, Sony claims the LiIon battery can last three years under normal charging conditions. The battery charges to 80% in an hour (with the player powered off), and charges to 100% in another three hours. Of course, Sony makes a big deal of the "up to 30 hours" claim. You are supposed to get that if you play ATRAC files encoded at 48kbps continuously. But none of us does that. We use different encodings and we fast forward or rewind and we play with the buttons. My usage indicates about 20 hours of playback with lots of button fidgeting and skipping forward or backward, playing files encoded at 64kbps. (Higher the bitrate, shorter the battery life, which is true for all digital players.) Is 20 hours "long"? I think so, since my previous MP3 players lasted no more than 6 hours on each charge. This is just vast improvement.You must use Sony's SonicStage (version 2.1) software to transfer music to the digital Walkman. I personally find SonicStage much better than some people claim. It's intuitive, fast and stable. It rips CDs faster than MusicMatch and maybe also faster than iTunes.In terms of MP3 conversion speed, on my laptop (2.2GHz P-4, 512MB RAM and 4200rpm hard disk), each 1GB of 128kbps MP3 took about 80 minutes to convert into 64kbps ATRAC3Plus. (BTW, for those who care, this is faster than converting 128kbps MP3 into 64kbps MP3 using dbPoweramp Music Converter.) Obviously, the faster your processor, the more RAM you have and the faster your hard disk, the less time the conversion will take. It's still a hassle for those of us with tons of MP3 music, but it's nothing that can't be done either overnight, or over the course of a romantic dinner (with double servings of desserts, ha ha).I didn't do much WMA conversion as most my WMA files are copy-protected songs purchased from MSN and Walmart online stores, so they cannot be converted into ATRAC. BTW, in the package you get a coupon for 5 free downloads from Sony's Connect music store, and the store works very well and the songs sound very good.Judging from my own experience and reviews posted on the web, I think you can typically expect 1GB of MP3 will take anywhere from 60 to 100 minutes to convert into ATRAC3Plus.In short, the Sony sports blow-everything-else-away physical dimensions, state-of-the-art hardware engineering and top-notch audio quality. It also has a clean user interface, a small but sharp LCD display (with green backlighting), and a very quiet 20GB hard disk. I'm in love with it. I was never in love with my iPod, Archos, Creative or RCA players. Even though with the Sony I had to convert my MP3s into ATRACs, the SonicStage program made it relatively easy and painless and I could just walk away for it to finish. And, man, I really love the 20 hours per charge battery life.My only minor complaints are: 1) the included case is not a real case; 2) the U.S. version of this thing doesn't come with the cool inline remote control; 3) you must remember to "authorize" your PC (in SonicStage) before you can transfer music - Sony is just too crazy about music protection; and 4) Sony, please release the MP3-playback firmware soon! Better yet, add WMA support as well!Of course, when Sony does release native MP3 playback support as widely reported, this Walkman will truly shine as the digital music player of choice.If you are a true music buff, or a diehard gadget freak, you just *have to* get this great digital Walkman."
This makes a nice, clean print and is reasonably priced. I've been able to print in high yields, so I'm happy.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media 128MB SMARTMEDIA DIGITAL FILM, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
I bought this item as a birthday gift for my friend. She said that it was great for her since she can listen the music with her iPod when she is driving. She likes this item very much!
I hate to admit it, but this is one product you need to read the manual for - the functions are not intuitive. Like if you want the low pass filter turned off, you adjust" it to zero, and thats off (plus the LPF led goes out). Same for delay, and other features. Just turning everything "OFF" takes alot of buttons. Then you decide which features your venue calls for from a street vendor to a massive concert hall.On the bright side you can do ALOT with this small product for very little money.In large venues, (300 feet or so) there is a time delay from stage to audience. The human ear can pick it up over 100 feet so that's a good design rule - reinforce your audio every 100 feet, in time sync. If you have multiple speaker sets (stage and 2nd tier for example) you need to introduce a delay to keep them in time sync or else the venue will sound strange - it will have a nasty echo. With this you can program delays by the foot, meter, or ms, up to 2.5 seconds of delay, which is a bit more than a half mile depending on elevation. The resolution is down to the inch in foot calibrated programming so no worries about running out of precision.Generally you are going to want your speaker system to vastly overpower the speaker so everyone can hear. It means the lips of the speaker generally are not in sync with the audio but people don't notice tiny lips from a balcony seat. They do notice screwed up audio though. Nobody likes feedback squeals when the performer walks past a speaker, once again the shark comes to the rescue - it has 10 programmable feedback killers - you need to read the manual here because they can self-program by making an impulse noise then cancelling out the feedback from it, and you need to tell the shark how many to pre-program based on the venue, and how many to leave "open" for changes like if the microphone moves into the audience. In this case the shark may kick in 2 or 3 more feedback killers on the fly to prevent feedback and that is its magic feature.Inputs/outputs are line or mic level selectable, and the fetures go on to the point I'd rewrite the manual here so keep it and read it. There is also a 48VDC phantom power on the mic input - or this can be used between two tiers of speakers for stopping feedback and adding delay. It will not remove delay, so you must draw up a timing diagram starting NOT at the stage inputs, but at the farthest point rearward (like exit doors rear audience). This is why speakers want an IEM or in ear monitor - they can hear their voice without all the delays this way and not be bothered. It's also a way for the producer to send queues like "commercial break - T minus 1 minute - wrap it up" to the speaker without everyone hearing it. This concept that the most distant speakers get no delay and the stage speakers get the most delay seems backwards, but since there is no such thing as negative delay, its the only way to make a large venue equal at virtually every seat in the house, plus it makes stage based feedback less likely even if a wireless mic wanders into the audience for some participation - they are free to move about the front speakers without feedback.Finally - the amazon comment about only comes in packs of 5 pcs is not true. You pay 80 dollars per unit, and if you order 5 units you get a rackmount for all 5. So you could say these are 1/5 rack wide and 2 rack high units in qty 5, how many you order depends on mono/stereo and how many speaker tiers you are driving most importantly. 1 tier per 100 feet is a good MINIMUM (more won't hurt) - so a 300 foot stage would have 4 tiers, stage level, 100 ft, 200 ft, and rearmost speakers which would need 3 or 4 sharks depending on what features you use on each unit properly programmed with their distance apart. With both TRS and XLR in/out constructing your tiered amplifiers is no problem. No contractor will build the speakers at exactly 100 feet which is why you can input the delay in feet/meters from measurement rather than ms if the architecht gave you 89 feet and 220 feet and 310 feet speaker locations before the rear speakeras at 400 feet. It's extremely precise (and quite fun sometimes if you put 2.5 seconds into the delay - that can be used in phone system paging to prevent feedback since quick announcements like "peter jones call 4049" will fit into 2.5 seconds of speach the person making the page wont hear themselves until they have spoken, and there is no chance for feedback either. Wired right it can be used as a poor man's killswitch for talk shows rather than bleep out offensive content. The possibilities there are endless.I'll end this explaining a confusing gain adjustment. There is a rear panel input gain and a front panel DSP gain - THEY are not the same! Use the rear panel gain to set levels, then use the front panel dsp gain to ensure the dsp doesn't clip. Basically the front panel gain is very small compared to the rear panel gain. This is counter intuitive that the main level gain is on the back and the front gain control does very little, but once they are balanced the performance is spectacular. A good start is mid range on both knobs leave all dsp gains at one point while you set levels with the rear gain, then come up front and adjust each dsp gain. You can see with 4 tiers, you could get 6-8 gain controls **in series**, so the reason the master gain is behind the panel is to avoid someone wandering in and cranking all 4 gains in series to the max and ruining the front stage speakers, thus requiring hours of re-adjustment by a sound engineer to fix it (I've been called in to fix these situations - I like the fact that the big gain is on the back where there is no fingerpoken)"
It must be hard to be a gadget designers. You take an excellent CD player and decide to add the ability to play MP3 and WMA files while selling the new model for the same price, and then, to your surprise, you get a bunch of whiners complaining why you didn't make it capable of showing porn movies and also washing dishes at the same time, all for the same low price.The point is, this is a very solid CD player that can also play MP3 and WMA files. The interface is very simple, just like on a regular CD discman. Yes, if you had 1000 songs you'd have to press the forward button 999 times to get to the last one. But this is not meant to be a dedicated MP3 player. For that you have the iPods, the RCA Lyras, the Rio's, the Archos jukeboxes. If you listen to a lot of MP3's, you should get a dedicated MP3 player, not this. This is for those of us who listen to CDs on the go a lot, and sometimes have a CD-R or two burned with our favorite MP3s.Tip - to get around the press forward 99 times to get to the 100th song or 999 times to get to the 1000th song" problem, put a dozen songs in each folder. The Panasonic automatically designates each folder an album, and you can skip to the next album by holding down the fast-forward button.As for the criticism of the volume, I guess it's a very personal thing. I listen to music on the earphones for about 1.5 hours each day, usually during my commute to and from work. I believe my hearing is excellent -- at least that's what my company doctor tells me -- so to me, the bundled Panasonic headphones are already pretty loud at volume level 18, even on a noisy subway such as the No. 1 train or one of the older N trains here in New York. But I usually use a set of Aiwa headphones with bass boost and in-line volume control (bought at Centure 21 downtown near the World Trade Center site) and everyone I've let try out this combination says the volume is more than adequate, even at mid-level settings. I think the upshot is, you have to try it yourself. If you have indulged in loud music directly over your ears over the years, the sad truth is you probably should cut down the amount of music you listen to and work with a specialist to restore some of your hearing abilities.So these are my 2 cents on the excellent SL-MP80. (The slightly cheaper SL-MP70 does not support WMA but is otherwise identical. I have a longer review for that model because that's what I eventually kept.) The sound quality is great, battery life is excellent (although it's stupid for Panasonic to put the battery compartment inside the player so you can't change batteries without taking out the CD), and the design is stylish. I think you'll like this CD player a lot, assuming you are not too hard at hearing."
I have a confession to make: I bought the SB-800 instead of the SB-600, but only after spending way too much time looking at both the two flashes and trying to decide which one was right for me. The 600 is a very sophisticated and capable flash, fully supporting Nikon's various TTL modes.(TTL=through the lens, meaning the camera monitors the flash.) The 600, as with the 800, is most effective on recent Nikon digital SLR bodies, esp. the D70, which can take full advantage of flash functions that constitute what Nikon calls creative lighting system (CLS)" (basically the CLS allows you to use multiple 600 and/or 800 flashes to create studio-like lighting conditions).(...)Of course, either the 600 or 800 (or even "older" Nikon flashes such as the SB-28, etc.) will provide better lighting than the internal flash. Whichever flash you buy, be sure to get one that allows you tilt the flash head so you can do bounce photography. Bounce photography makes a world of difference vis-a-vis direct flash when it comes to indoor portraits.(Originally posted on the SB-800 product page: Why I chose the SB-800 over SB-600):I won't repeat the wealth of information the other kind reviewers have already given. I'll just focus on why I decided to cough up the extra $100 to get the SB-800 instead of the less powerful SB-600.Compared to the SB-600, the SB-800 has the following extra features:1) Much more powerful, as reflected in the GN.2) Slightly faster recycle time with the standard four AA batteries. It also comes with a battery holder that holds a fifth battery which cuts down recycle time by 1/3 to 1/2.3) The SB-800 has non-TTL auto and auto aperture modes. (More on this later.)4) In wireless remote mode, the SB-800 can act both as the master and slave, whereas the 600 can only be a slave.5) It comes with a useful diffusion dome, which won't even fit on the SB-600.6) The SB-800 package also includes two colored gel filters.7) The SB-800 can do repeating flash (in the same exposure), for a strobe effect.Basically, both the 600 and 800 support Nikon's latest flash technologies, i-TTL (supported by the D70 and D2H only) and CLS (creative lighting system), in addition to all the TTL (through the lens) flash modes Nikon introduced in the past. The 600 is really a prosumer-level flash that's either TTL or manual, whereas the 800 is pure pro-grade with a lot of modes and options. The manual, evidently written by a Japanese manual writer, attests to its sophistication; understanding the manual will really require a Ph.D. in yoga so you don't stress yourself out.The 800's auto modes are what won me over in the end. The auto modes can set the flash output automatically on Nikon bodies that do not support any TTL (through the lens) mode. On those bodies, with the 600 you'd have to resort to manual, which is simply a pain in the butt, not to mention prone to error. The two non-TTL auto modes on the 800 are auto aperture and auto. You'll need to study the manual very carefully to figure out the difference; I still haven't, but I'm already enjoying the auto aperture mode. The availability of auto modes also means the 800 can be used on a wide range of Nikon bodies than the simpler 600.If you are deciding between the 600 and the 800 like I was, ask yourself the following questions:1) Do you have an extra $100-$150 to spend? If yes, the 800.2) Do you plan to use the external flash a lot? If yes, the 800.3) Do you have Nikon bodies (usually older manual ones) that do not support TTL (you can find out in the camera's user's guide)? If yes, the 800.4) Do you plan to do a lot of wireless flash photography and take full advantage of Nikon's Creative Lighting System? If yes, the 800.5) If you want to get a diffusion dome that fits the flash, get the 800.In the end, I think the SB-800 is a better long-term investment than the SB-600, despite the higher price. It's much more powerful and flexible, and even though it's an overkill for me right now, I imagine when my flash photography improves (and I'm trying very hard right now), it'll prove a very worthy investment.Feel free to drop me an e-mail at hotmail with any questions. BTW, if anyone knows of a good web forum that discusses how to effectively use Nikon's sophisticated flash modes and the CLS, please let us know. Thanks."
Good quality for its price. It lasts, but the only thing is that when the battery is low it immediately shuts off the Palm.
When entering the world of macro photography you need to select a closeup flash because the units mounted on the hot shoe or the built in flash are shadowed by the lens. The SRF-11 is the more powerful of the two units but the STF-22 gives you more precise control as to where the light goes. Either way, you only need to buy the S" version once because that includes the FC-01 flash controller which doubles as a ring light and twin flash controller. After that, you can add the other flashes if needed.For example, a TF-22 package includes everything necessary except the FC-01 controller (and contrary to the amazon writeup it DOES include the SR-1 ring) If you own the 11-22 mm lens, the TF-22 is the only macro flash able to run with your lens because it threads into the filter (72mm) on the 11-22 mm lens. The RF-11 uses the bayonet lugs to mount the glare shields and does not thread into the filter system.The TF-22 can be mounted to the end of the lens, or each flash can be mounted to a small tripod. The TF-22 has a setting to adjust the amount of light balance between the two flashes.If you never buy the TF-22, you will have all the parts needed to operate the RF-11 because you purchased the SRF-11 package. If you want twin flash to start, order the STF-22 package.You can also buy the FC-01 controller separately, however it is the most expensive way to get the unit. Buying a package deal to start and then adding other flahses is a much better bargain."
This tiny sized 32 MB multimedia card is well worth the price. I needed some extra storage. Next time I'll buy more capacity but I've been satisfied with this one.
Product in good condition.Shipping is very fast.And the price is much more cheaper than those in a store.
the Rhinotek brand is better in quality and performance than the canon brand. the ink last longer and my photos and documents look great.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar 512MB 24x CompactFlash Card, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this 512MB card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

The F30 is an evolutionary step-up in terms of low-light performance from the F10, which was the first ultra-compact camera to give high-quality high-ISO pictures. The F30 is about the same size as its predecessor but actually looks and feels smaller, thanks to its restyling. However, I found the F10 much easier to hold and operate.In terms of ISO performance, the F30 is about the same ISO-for-ISO as the F10, but adds a ISO 3200 setting. To be honest, pictures taken at ISO 3200 are barely usable beyond web or e-mail, i.e., an ISO 3200 won't make even a good 6x4" print. But it's there if you do need it, and I have used it on quite a number of low-light conditions. In the end, I think it's a good thing to have, because memories, even captured with a lot of digital noise, can be too precious to not record.The F30 simplifies the user interface of the F10 but I find it harder to use than the F10. If you are not an upgrader from the F10 like me, since shouldn't be a problem. The buttons are smaller than on the F10 but still usable even by someone like myself with big hands. One welcome improvement is the F30 now uses a standard mini-USB cable, as opposed to the special-connector dongle the F10 had. You still need that Fuji cable, though, unless you use a separate USB reader and take out the xD card each time you download to PC (which is what I do).In regular ISO pictures, quality is very good but not yet top-notch. In other words, you get good-quality, pleasing pictures but you should know that Canon cameras probably still give you slightly better pictures at the low ISOs. But, alas, this is a totally subjective opinion, so don't take my words for it. You should judge the picture quality yourself. Even I'd have preferred Canon's image quality at ISO 100 and 200, I still value Fuji's low-ISO performance, enough to upgrade to the F30 instead of buying a Canon.The F30 is fast. I think it's a hair faster (i.e., less shutter delay) than the F10. The built-in LCD, also at 2.5" diagonal, has twice as many pixels as the F10 but the post-shot preview can look coarse. The camera is now made in China (as opposed to Japan for the F10) but is quite well constructed.One amazing thing about the F10 was its amazing battery life. The F30 is even better! I've taken over 600 high-resolution pictures with hours and hours of VGA video on my F30 in the 3 months I've had it, and the battery status indicator still has two out of three bars remaining! This is just amazing! I used to have a Casio that had long battery life, but the F10 and now F30 are just way better when it comes to battery life.So there were two reasons I chose the F10 and then upgraded to the F30, instead of getting a Canon or a Panasonic (which has great zoom and optical stabilization features). One, the good low-ISO performance. Two, Fujifilm supports the panda preservation program at the National Zoo in D.C., and I'm a big sucker for those black-and-white bears, so I support Fujifilm. But when it comes to technical details, I'm totally unbiased, so you can trust my reviews.Feel free to contact me with questions."
At over 8 pounds of carrying weight, this Vaio is not ideal as a traveling laptop. Instead, it's designed to be a desktop replacement. Witness the 2.8Ghz P4 processor (not the mobile version), which is screaming fast especially for gaming and video/audio editing, as well as 512MB of fast RAM and large screen. BTW, the screen is beautiful and has terrific viewing angles.This particular configuration is a good value; what you won't get is built-in DVD burner. Otherwise Sony, in its usual way, throws in a lot of add-on software. Performance seems pretty good, as the system is responsive at all times. The internal fan does kick in a lot, to cool down the system. In this regard, I highly recommend a cooling pad with built-in fans, such as the Bytecc cooling pad" I'm currently using. It plugs into the USB port and the fans keep the air flowing under the laptop.A beautiful screen, admirably fast performance, and general good looks make this Vaio a good choice for anyone except those needing a constant traveling companion."
I'm one of the few vitims that has 5 remotes laying around. I have a DVD player, VCR, and DishNetwork all hooked up to the TV. I have to keep all of them because the Dish people forgot to set up all of my stuff. I looked up the remote online and the codes only worked for the Sanyo VCR/DVD combo and only the VCR part. So when I was picking up a few fold-up chairs at Big Lots when I looked through the electroncis selection I found a little selection of RCA remotes. There were only two that were universal. One was $6 thahad 3 universal functions but it was loaded with tons of features that are probably found on only the remotes that come with your TV or VCR or DVD player. But I also had Dish, which means I needed a 4 component remote when I found the RCU404. IT's not a feature-full remote but at least it had the basics and hooked up to everything I needed. It had a list on the back that said these and more. Sanyo were listed in the DVD and VCR section but no Memorex was in the TV section but it said AND MORE...and Memorex isn't that small of a brand and when I open the package at home and looked at the codes...oh wow...it works for Memorex.I'm glad I no longer have to carry around Sanyo, Memorex, and DishNetwork remotes seperately. Now I only have one. The RCU404 is a pretty good remote. It's not feature loaded and it's kinda small for most people but it works with almost anything, is a very inexpensive replacement, and is easy to use. Plus, it has a strong warranty. The RCU404 is a good general replacement for any universal remote or getting rid of that four remote rack on your TV stand (don't be ashamed, more people should use them if they have that many).
The iPod is hands-down the best portable music player ever made. With a few tweaks by Apple, however, it could be the best gadget ever made (Read on).First, the original iPod is a breakthrough, not because it plays MP3s, not because of its long-lasting rechargeable battery, not because it holds 1,000 songs or 5 MBs of data. It's because it's all of these things in a 6.5-ounce package (lighter than my cell phone) with ULTRA-fast FIREWIRE. Try loading 1,000 songs onto a USB device and your computer will be whirring away all night. The iPod does it in 10 minutes. That's 100 CDs, man. (Or, with the new 10MB iPod, 2,000 songs or 200 CDs).The iPod also has a brilliantly simple and elegant scrolling wheel that is as intuitive as a squirt gun. Pull the trigger, press a button, you're listening to Pearl Jam.Now, despite the fact that this is undeniably the biggest breakthrough in portable music since the original Walkman, the iPod misses a couple of opportunities to MULTIPLY its value with a few small tweaks.For starters, the iPod's value would increase dramatically if it could RECORD. I would ditch my Minidisc recorder that I use for my dayjob as a reporter in an instant if I could record to the iPod instead (MP3 encoding would be sweet, too..can you imagine what folks would pay for a 6.5 ounce gadget that could record 100 hours of digital audio?).I sincerely hope Apple is already working on the recording feature.Next, and perhaps even more important, would be a camera-docking feature. How many times have you been on a vacation to Europe or somesuch with your digital camera, and shelled out a small fortune for measly 64 MB or 128 MB flash cards? How much do you think professional digital photographers would pay for a 5GB or 10GB flash card?... You don't think they'd snatch up a fleet of iPods for docking their cameras if they could? You're darn right they would. (And professional digital photography, especially at newspapers, is one area where Apple is a clear leader). Hopefully Apple is talking to the Canon folks who make the superior digital ELPH as we speak.This feature would be a perfect fit with iPhoto, just as the iPod is a perfect fit now with iTunes. Can you just imagine, instant Firewire syncing of all your images? It would be nice also if they added a color TFT screen option to view the photos, but perhaps that's just wishful thinking.And, speaking of wishful thinking, how about a video-docking feature? 5GB is about the same as one DVD (4.7GB), so why not have an iPod docking feature for digital video cameras? Get easy syncing with iMovie and burn it with iDVD.Lots of folks also see potential for the iPod to morph into a PDA. Already, Apple has added a software patch that allows you to download Palm or Outlook contacts. I personally don't see a need for taking that too far. The iPod is the best music player ever. With a few tweaks, it has the potential to be the best audio recorder ever and the best camera docking solution ever. It will never be the best PDA ever, so why try?Once again, kudos to Apple, but I only give this four stars because the iPod can be so much more, if only the folks at Cupertino don't blow it.Enjoy!
Man, the folks at Apex sure turn out some very solid products at incredible prices. (I just hope they aren't using child or prison labor! :-&gt; ) The AT2002 is a basic TV set that's being discontinued but still represents a great value, because you get a high-quality picture tube, lots of features, and good viewing angles. Nobody will take this for a plasma TV that's for sure, so those who don't really own a unit should stop trashing this Ameican brand.
Okay, headphones are a pain in the a$$! Trust me, you need to go through thousands to find the right ones. Let's get on with the review!Sound Quality (4/5) - The sound quality on these is far by good. The bass is very deep, not too deep, but having bass too deep IS a problem (can't hear anything but BOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!). If you wanna hear deep bass, put pressure on these. Feel discomfort from the clip and have a headache for the amount of bass. Congrats! You've become an idiot! Anyway, the volume on these is quite loud, but not quite as loud as Sony's h.ear, but the treble is better. Who says you can have it all (if you've ever heard anyone tell you that you can have it all, please hit their head with a shovel)?Comfort (5/5) - Now, if you read the packaging (which contains someone who looks a lot like Jennifer Lopez, btw), it states things about comfort. Well, those are in fact all true. These headphones are VERY comfortable, and at times I can't notice they're on. Definite 5 stars in comfort.Design (3/5) - Ok, design is good and awful. Let me break it down:Good:- The cord is long. Why good: This would be good for people using these for computering, studio monitoring, video/music editing, things that NEED a long cord.- The cord is made with strong plastic. Why good: This would be good for bike or ATV riding. Cords get damaged from being hit with a helmet, or just in the air. This is perfect for that, and other similar rough activities.- The plug is gold plated. Why good: This would be good for most audiophiles and people (freaks) who detail every little thing in every song. Gold plated plugs also seem to be louder than silver plugs.- The hook is a spring hook. Why good: For people with elf ears (pointy ears), this will make it easier to fit on.Bad:- The hook is a spring hook. Why bad: This is the biggest negative of this headphone. The spring hook, makes the speaker go away from the ear, taking out bass and volume that all those audiophiles (and freaks) just love. Why else is this bad: This also make it leak sound. This is a pain for people listening to loud music, which make a little distraction for people sitting next to you (like a bus, or classroom, or a public place).Features (5/5) - Yay! A positive! The features on the w.ear are pretty great. Firstly, the interchangeable covers is a nice touch, and there are blue and silver to choose from. The silver sure looks nice next to my SLCT582V, and the blue would look nice on more colored objects (such as a bright colored CD player, Sony's new PSYC players to be specific). As I said, the spring clip is a big positive and a big negative. So yeah, there may be only two features, but these are headphones, you're not getting a thousand features on them.Portability (5/5) - Ok, pictures mean nothing. Yeah, their clip design". That's what I like to call advertising. Not all clip designs are slim, but that is what Sony and the picture are making you think. Even though these DO happen to be very slim, fair warning. Anyway, these are very slim. Slimmer than my slim design CD player. So, these are very portable.Price (4/5) - The price for these are surely not a bargain, but they aren't overpriced. The price is set about just right. Most headphones with these features would be also around the $20 mark.Who they might be for: These headphones would be for people who aren't TOO picky about audio quality, but still want decent sound from them. People who might be using them for long periods of time, or have small-normal sized ears. Maybe for people using computers, or for studio monitoring of some such (but you will need to buy an adapter). People may want to consider these for durability, for maybe people doing sports, bike/ATV riding, or other rough activities. These may be good for people who are using these in not-so-public places, but still travel a lot, or even for home usage. These would be good for people who like interchangeable covers and style.In my opinion, these overall deserve 4 stars. They aren't exactly perfect, but they're damn there close."
The color is great, it perfectly fits my player and it is cool~ the seller eforcity shipped out same day, speedy shipping, great price, thanks!
IOMEGA ZIP 250 InternalThis internal ATAPI drive is the fastest access to a replaceable ZIP 250 disk compared to a drive that connects to the parallel port, even when the Parallel Port Accelerator program is used to optimize data transfer. The external drive that uses a USB connection is the next best thing. The ZIP drive is always installed on the secondary IDE channel, never the same IDE channel used for the hard drive. The CD drive is usually the master or first drive, the ZIP drive should be the secondary or slave drive. Installing an internal drive requires more knowledge than with an external drive, whether USB or parallel port.NEVER insert a ZIP disk into a drive unless the power is on, as this can damage the drive. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole in the back. Once the drive is installed correctly turn on power and then you can install the IomegaWare software from the CD. Use the applications to format, copy, and protect your ZIP disks. Or you can download the software from the Iomega web site. Use the Copy Machine application to duplicate a ZIP disk. You can format a ZIP disk with the Iomega Format, or run applications from a ZIP disk. You can both Read and Write Protect your ZIP disks.You should install the IomegaWare software in Windows 2000 to format ZIP disks so they will be compatible with other Windows operating systems (FAT system). If a ZIP disk is formatted in NTFS it can lock the disk so the eject button on the device does not work. You should always choose the software eject command because of disk caching in Windows 2000 and XP. The ZIP disk provides unlimited storage space within its capacity. Space on a ZIP drive is reused when files are replaced or deleted. The Long Format can correct disk errors or remove protection from files. The 250MB disk can be read and written in the 750MB drive.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.
The HP940C inkjet printer is designed for the home or office. It comes in a light gray case shaped like other HP printers. It connects to a computer with either an IEEE 1284 parallel cable (DOS or Windows) or a USB cable (Windows 98, Me, 2000, XP). The black inkjet cartridge is the #15, the tricolor inkjet cartridge is the #78 (replacing the #17 tricolor cartridges used in earlier printers). This printer works well for the average user. HP has long been the leader in inkjet printing.The paper path is the same U-shaped method used in other HP printers. This minimizes desk space and provides a more compact printer than those that use an oblique paper path. You should connect the cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the computer or printer. The power supply is built into the printer and not separate like earlier products. This makes it more difficult to replace if it fails. It is not good practice to keep the printer powered on when not in use; heat is the enemy of electronics.The Quick Reference Guide has a section on pages 7 to 10 for solving installation problems. Be sure to read the warnings on page 69 about proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. Do not refill print cartridges, this can void the warranty.The Quick Help document has chapters on learning about this printer, printing on paper and other media, printer maintenance, problem solving, and specifications. There are five cartridge status lights to identify a problem. Both printer cartridges are required to operate even if one is empty. The Deskjet Toolbox provides functions like cleaning print cartridges. Print cartridges and the print cartridge cradle can be cleaned manually using distilled water and a clean cotton swab.
Other manufacturers like Apex, Initial and Shinco make decent portable DVD players at a lower price, but Panasonic products are simply the best in terms of quality. From sharp pictures to booming sound (even from the built-in speakers) to build quality, you can't do better than this. The price is high, but you do get what you pay for. If you plan to watch DVDs on the road only occasionally, an Apex or Initial would suffice and you do get a lot of bang for the buck. If you watch DVDs a lot, though, I highly recommend the Panasonic. I have this and an Initial product and trust me, the quality difference is just huge.
Sony's UX series micro PCs already come with a port replicator included, but if you might need a second one. I bought a second one for my office, but I only bought it after I saw a used one for about 100 bucks. Otherwise this is too expensive.
Rhino's use alot of power. The 530 has extra sensors to plot the atmospheric pressure so you know if a storm is headed your way. Both the 520 and 530/hcx transmit with a whopping 5.0 watts (as opposed to 0.5 watts in FRS with alkaline batteries in the disposable radios) - with 5.0 watts you can go a long way. You can turn down the power if you want to save it. You can adjust screen backlighting, but inevitably you will drain your battery in a half a day of talking on the high power radio with your group (I use a headset for convenience).When your power drops automatically from 5 to 2 watts you KNOW its time to change batteries. Having this in your pocket is like gold. In fact, the contacts are gold plated - haven't seen that kind of quality since the HP calculators.A 270 degree turn of the bail that holds it in place releases the battery - and the new one goes on just as the old did. As the previous person mentioned, they do have a temperature sensor (not sure if it is a thermocouple or thermistor) but it has 2 uses - tell the radio if the battery is too hot to charge or to tell you the temperature. This is why while charging you won't get a filled in temperature display until it cools down.Of course, having a second battey solves this problem -- I'm happy with mine and keep it on charge, while the rino's is on the radio without the clipon charger, which could stand alot of improvement in mechanical design.If you talk alot - you need this - if you don't transmit your rino may run for 18 hours. It's how often you hit the push to talk button that drains the battery and if you use all the accessories. You can conserve power by turning off stuff you don't need (if you are in poor gps coverage, turn off gps - it drains alot of power - if you are not needing a weather forcast, turn off the weather sensor - it usese a little power - turn of the thermometer if not needed. This is why the specs on the 530 give you one less hour of runtime. But you have the ability to cripple your 530 into a 520 and gain back your hour - even more if you shutdown gps when not needed and squelch the radio into powersave plus turn off the backlight. I can get 24 hours easily if I do this and still have a functional radio.
I'm not going to repeat all the accolades others have bestowed on this great interchangeable-lens digital SLR. I just want to add a few real-user observations:1) The 20D is a very solid camera in your hands. From the hefty weight to the sizable size and the solid grip, it makes you feel you are holding a real SLR, unlike with the Digital Rebel (EOS 300D). BTW this is assembled in Japan instead of Taiwan (300D).2) The camera is very fast. It's not instant on" like the Nikon 70D but it's still damned fast with very littel shutter lag. When you use a high-speed CF card, the shot-to-shot performance is satisfying for most fast-action scenarios.3) Great auto focus, great exposure, and great picture quality. Canon's expertise in combining optics and electronics once again shines through. The prints made from this baby, and in part thanks to the 8MP resolution, is just total pro-quality.4) The kit lens is not really that good, unlike what Nikon bundles in their kits. It's still a high-quality lends but the max aperture is slow and the lens itself looks and feels cheap.5) The old photography wisdom about how an expensive camera does not turn an amateur into a pro overnight still applies. At least you can impress your girlfriend with cr*p that looks like gold for a second there. :) (sorry didn't mean to sound sexist...)The EOS 20D is one AWESOME digital SLR. If you are real serious about getting a high-quality SLR, consider the 20D or its Nikon competitor, not a low-priced model."

It just amazes me how DVD players are now inexpensive commodities, just four years after I bought my first DVD player, a Panasonic that cost me a small fortune (the price of being the first on the block to have a DVD player).I was at least a bit skeptical about this Chinese DVD player, but since it's so cheap and the reviews here seem generally positive, I gave it a try. Boy is it a very capable DVD player. The exterior is a stylish silver and the player mechanism handles all my DVDs and DVD-Rs and CDs and CD-R/RWs with utmost grace. Setting up was a breeze, as was expected of a DVD player these days, although the instructions can make you laugh.At this time the unknown factor is the machine's long-term reliability. But so far it looks durable and works fine, and frankly for such a low price (even without the Amazon.com exclusive rebate), it's already a winner.
AVthing in its place makes a great record rack! These record racks are scarce--even with an internet search. They are well constructed and I like that the price includes shipping!These attractive record racks won't be an eyesore and they are easy to put together. I am all thumbs" and my handyman, who was over here doing something else anyway, just gave me some quick help with the assembly. These may come without casters but as you can see in the image provided above you can attach casters, especially if you only need one of these units and can therefore rest it on the floor.I have a collection that needs space for more than 100 LPs, so I stacked two of mine. The overall effect is that unless you look closely it appears to be a unit of very, very carefully built storage cubes for record albums. And, in fact, that's what it will be if you buy more than one of these and stack them.The solid hardwood is really pretty good for the price that you pay; and you get to choose between ebony and oak. I picked ebony because it's a more neutral color for my place.Overall, these record racks are terrific for vinyl lovers like me! Of course, if you use them without casters they can be used to store anything else that can fit inside them. Here's hoping you find these as useful as I did."
Philips makes a very reliable blank CD-R that can handle up to 80 minutes of music or 700 megabytes of data. Moreover, these blank CD-Rs are capable of recording data at high speeds up to 52x." The data I recorded onto these CD-Rs has now lasted for over a year, proving the test of time. I have used these as data discs and discs to record audio. I almost never got a coaster. I am very, very sorry to read that some other people had bad experiences with this brand of CD-R blank media; I can only write of my own personal experience with Philips blank CD-Rs.The CD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data or music onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your CD-Rs that have anything stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than the packaging advertises. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your CD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the CD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--and you wouldn't want that, now would you? If you need to label the discs, label its' jewel case using a post-it note. At least that's what I do.Overall, Philips blank CD-R discs store data reliably (at least in my experience) and I believe that an extra minute to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it in the event that it doesn't actually burn at the very highest speed advertised."
HP Deskjet 3820 PrinterThe HP3820 inkjet printer is designed for the average user at home or office. It comes in a two_tone beige and grayish_blue case like other HP printers. It connects to a computer with either an IEEE 1284 parallel cable (Windows 95) or a USB cable (Windows 98, Me, 2000, XP). The inkjet cartridges are: #15 for black, #78 for tricolor. The U_shaped paper path is the same as in other HP printers. This minimizes desk space and provides a more compact printer than those that use an oblique paper path. You should connect the cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the computer or printer. The power supply is built into the printer and not separate like earlier products. It is not good practice to keep the printer powered on when not in use; heat is the enemy of electronics. HP has long been the leader in inkjet printing. It can also be used with Apple Macintosh computers, see the User's Guide for the Mac.Its advertising leaflet claims brilliant photo quality and proven performance" due to HP's specially developed ink and papers. HP has "proven performance and product technology " for its family of products. The software provides an on_screen low_ink indicator. You can cancel any print by pressing the top button, a handy feature to correct a mistake. Its size and fold_up paper tray make it a compact fit for your home or small office. HP advises against refilling its cartridges, as you will learn from experience. It can print up to 12 pages a minute in black and up to 10 pages a minute in color; your results may differ. The original CD_ROM software provides the printer drivers . If you bought this used you can download the drivers from HP for Windows 2000, XP, and Vista. You may find the software for Windows 95, 98, and Me on the Internet.The User's Guide tells about getting started. The Print Cartridge Status light will blink when a print cartridge is low on ink, improperly installed, or malfunctioning (or wrong cartridge) top cover is open, or other problems. Open the top cover for details. From the front the five indicators run left to right for: color cartridge problem, black cartridge problem, color ink low, black ink low, print cartridges OK. Both print cartridges must be present to operate the printer. Leave an empty cartridge in place until it is replaced with a new one. Read the warnings about the proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. The Reference Guide has the complete details on this printer. The DeskJet Toolbox provides functions like cleaning print cartridges. Print cartridges and the print cartridge cradle can be cleaned manually using distilled water and a clean cotton swab. There is an accessory to allow Two_Sided Printing on some DeskJet printers. The guide explains inserting it into the printer and choosing this option on the Toolbox screen. Both manuals can be downloaded from the HP Internet site.It is easier to feed a single sheet if there are other sheets beneath it."
TDK tapes are all made with dependability in mind. I bought my TDK MiniDV tapes a year ago and have been using two of them heavily (saved one for archive), and both work reliably in my Sony camcorder. I actually record in Sony's LP mode, which records 90 minutes on the 60-minute tapes, and the video and audio quality is excellent, even after repeated uses. I highly recommend TDK products.
This is a solid stereo VCR. I haven't used any of the so-called advanced features, because I just use it to tape a few TV programs and play back old VHS tapes. Everything works great. The unit I received was assembled in Malaysia, not Japan, but the build quality is very decent. My other Panasonic VCR (non-stereo) has lasted over 12 years. I think this newer one will last another good long time.
This cable seems to be very good quality and works great. For the price I paid, I don't think I could have done better.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Memorex 64MB SmartMedia Memory Card with Storage Case, like most 64MB cards, will store on average 71 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 53 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 32 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 25 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 20 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

Fuji makes a reliable blank DVD-R that can handle up to 4.7 GB of data. Moreover, these blank DVD-Rs are capable of recording data at speeds up to 8x. That speed may sound slow these days but it's still pretty fast. The data I record onto these lasts for years, proving the test of time. I have used these as discs to record video both with and without sound. Great!The DVD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your DVD-Rs that have data stored on them.

DLP projection TVs have come a long way since they first surfaced about three years ago. Mitsubishi has in the last 15 months also built themselves into the leader in DLP TV by offering industry-leading DLP performance as well as value for the money.First off, despite being larger and heavier than plasma and LCD sets, Mitsubishi's DLP TVs still look really good. If you place it well in a living room, your friends might think it's a plasma!The image quality is where it counts, right? This 65 model supports 1080p, the highest HDTV display mode. The "p" stands for progressive scan, i.e., every line of each TV image is drawn instead of every other line as in old TV, resulting in clearer pictures (although I find it very difficult to tell the difference between 1080i and 1080p even on a huge set like this). This Mitsubishi does a very admirable job at taking full advantage of the latest DLP technology and for a long while I simply could not believe I was looking at a DLP projection TV. The video images are not only bright but"
There was a time that I never considered buying an Apple display. I figured a Mac costs enough money, without spending $1000, or more, on a display. In late January 2005, I purchased the newest Powerbook G4 12 inch 1.5 GHZ G4, with superdrive. The notebook had nearly all the performance I was looking for, and the small form factor allows me to easily haul it around the house, or the world should I ever get to travel properly. However, I wanted more from my Powerbook, when at my desk.Yes, I was already using my Powerbook with an external display. It was an analog Sony LCD. However, it was only 15 inches, with a resolution of 1024x768, so I actually had as little screen real estate on my external display, as I had on the 12 inch built-in display. I wanted more.After deciding a 17 inch LCD would not be enough, I ordered the Apple's 20 Cinema Display, and I'm glad I did. Unfortunately, the box arrived beat-up, and there was even dirt inside. However, everything inside seemed to work ok, thankfully. Un-wrapping the cinema display was a joy, and I was eager to put it on my desk. The design of this display is stunning. The aluminium enclosure will please the eyes of anyone, and the back of the display is as beautiful, if not more beautiful than the front. There is a single cable that comes from the back of the display, which neatly goes through an opening on the aluminium stand. This single cable splits in the end into Firewire, USB, DVI, and a power connector that you plug into the power brick. I connected the firewire, USB, and DVI to my Powerbook, and then I connected the power to the display. Wow. It was perfect out of the box. I could never get the color profile right on my old external display, but the cinema display was out of the box the most beautiful display I had ever used. The brightness was exceptional, and it took a few days for me to get used to the brightness. Yes, you can lower the brightness with grace of your finger over the sophisticated tough-sensitive buttons on the right side of the display, but I loved the look at full-brightness.My computing experience has been at another level, since the cinema display arrived. Whether I'm browsing the web, working in Photoshop and iPhoto, or making a movie in iMovie, the 20" cinema display and its 1680x1050 resolution is a joy to use. The display also gives me two USB and two Firewire ports directly behind the panel, which is incredibly convenient. If you're a gamer, which I'm not, you will appreciate the 16ms response this display offers.Yes, your computer does all the hard work, but it is your display you interact with. A great display like the Apple Cinema Display allows you to get more done, with less work and effort. For example, you do not have to figure out how to fit all your Photoshop palettes on the screen, for there is plenty of room.DVDs are quite the experience on this display as well. I popped in Shrek 2, and I was amazed by the images, but DVDs are far from the only reason you should want a widescreen. The widescreen aspect of this display allows you to work in the way our minds are designed and used to working. We read from left to right, so a display that is wider than it is long makes a lot of sense.Overall, if you would like to save some money, there are other displays out there. Dell actually offers a 20 inch widescreen display, which compares nicely with this one, even supporting additional inputs. However, it does lack something. It lacks the beauty in design that the Apple Cinema Display offers, and it probably lacks some of the quality control that Apple strives hard to achieve. For example, Apple might reject some of the panels they use inside of this display, if they suspect quality concerns, where other manufactures may use any panel they are supplied with, without spending the time and money to ensure a quality panel. If you believe you would like to spend some money on a fantastic display to use with your Powerbook, PowerMac, or DVI-output PC, then you should not pass-up this beauty. It is truly a piece of art from an aesthetics point of view, and the images it displays are spectacular. This display will not look like "yesterday's" display anytime soon. In fact, it is a pleasure to enjoy a display that does not look like it should be part of a busy, cluttered office. This display oozes beauty and grace, and the stock Apple pictures do not do it justice. The Apple Cinema Display gives you the full computing experience."
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Smart Modular Technology 128MB Secure Digital Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
It is a question that all digital camera enthusiasts ask themselves shortly after purchasing a digital camera, but it is one that is not easily answered as there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. This review will help to guide you to the best solution based off the characteristics and specifications of the Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera. I feel I am qualified to provide this information as I was in the memory industry for 7 years but having left the industry a year ago, I can be completely unbiased on this subject.One of the biggest factors to consider is the megapixel rating of this Gateway camera. Considering this particular camera is generally considered to be a 4MP digital camera. You can expect to store approximately 32 images on a 64MB card, 64 pictures on a 128MB flash card, 128 digital pictures on digital film of 256MB capacity, 256 pics on a 512MB picture card, 512 images on a 1GB media card, 1,024 photos on a 2GB flash card, and a monstrous 2,048 digital photos on a 4GB card. These image/picture calculations assume that you are going to utilize the full potential of your camera but won't shoot in RAW mode. In other words, the estimates are for shooting at the highest JPEG setting available for the Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera. Understand that they are indeed estimates and can vary based off the actual scene or subject being shot and the amount of light, color variation, detail, etc. in the photo. You can assume these numbers are accurate within 10%.However how many images a card can hold is not the only factor you should consider before buying this all important accessory. You should also consider that you may want to use your Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera to take shots of sporting events, wildlife, or even your child's unique expressions. These moments have a very small window of opportunity to get the shot you desire thus a flash card that has been rated by experts as being a faster card may be something to consider. In my opinion, it is always best to find a review of a flash card as it performed in your specific digital camera. Some cameras just work better with specific flash cards do to the software, firmware, buffer utilization, etc. between the camera and the flash card. Finding an answer to this question is not usually an easy task. There is, though, a superb website that not only offers flash card reviews but also has an extensive user forum that can answer this all important question for you. You may want to take a look at dpreview dot com and then do a search for the Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera in the forums area, if that doesn't work just do a search on Gateway and you should be able to find someone that can help you. I am fairly certain you will have plenty of information to make an informed buying decision. You may also want to look at their detailed review of this particular camera as well if you have not yet decide on whether to purchase it.Of course one of the next factors to consider is in regards to price. Please, do not make the mistake that I have made of buying the absolute cheapest flash card. Take a look at the factors I have mentioned here before you make a purchase. Think of a flash card for your Gateway camera as an extension to it. Just as you wouldn't purchase the cheapest camera case for your camera (personally I own the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack but I like the extra room and the backpack style, which may not be your cup of tea) don't necessarily purchase the cheapest flash card either. Keep in mind that you will use this card every single time you use your camera. Like I said it is truly an extension of your digital camera.The final thing I will mention is in regards to service. There are a number of flash card suppliers in the world today. However all of the flash cards are actually built by a handful (3 - 5) of companies and even those companies only have a few options (2 - 4) regarding which components they are going to use in their particular design. More or less, the actually hardware inside each flash card is going to be similar but the way in which they utilize that hardware and the level of support they will provide, given there is a problem, are more paramount. Just imagine going 10 days without a flash card for your camera (which I did) because you are waiting for some company to repair your flash card, or worse yet having it fail and having no recourse. There are a couple of manufacturers that do very well in regards to utilizing technology and providing customer service. As of the time of this writing they are SanDisk, Lexar, and Viking. However check the newsgroups and forums for the latest information as it can be very cyclical and unfortunately can take a turn for the worse overnight.No matter what flash card you decide to use with your digital camera make sure you take the time to take the pictures. Time flies by fast and having thousands of images to thumb through 5 years from now to remind you of the time that has gone by will be the most powerful investment of all. I have personally purchased a SimpleTech external hard drive to store my images on (another reason I like the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack as it gives me room to put in my hard drive). The hard drive combined with the backpack allows me to take my photos with me when I go visit family and friends. I use PhotoShop exclusively to do all my photo editing and batch processing (a great feature of PhotoShop) and of course make occasional backups to DVD-RW.Enjoy your Gateway DC-M42 4MP Digital Camera. I hope this review has informed you how this camera can be best enhanced by a flash card and the best approach in finding one that meets your specific needs.
IOMEGA ZIP 250 InternalThis internal ATAPI drive is the fastest access to a replaceable ZIP 250 disk compared to a drive that connects to the parallel port, even when the Parallel Port Accelerator program is used to optimize data transfer. The external drive that uses a USB connection is the next best thing. The ZIP drive is always installed on the secondary IDE channel, never the same IDE channel used for the hard drive. The CD drive is usually the master or first drive, the ZIP drive should be the secondary or slave drive. Installing an internal drive requires more knowledge than with an external drive, whether USB or parallel port. A 250 MB disk can contain about ten thousand 25KB files, or a thousand 250KB files. The 250Mb drive can read and write 100Mb disks.NEVER insert a ZIP disk into a drive unless the power is on, as this can damage the drive. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole in the back. Once the drive is installed correctly turn on power and then you can install the IomegaWare software from the CD. Use the applications to format, copy, and protect your ZIP disks. Or you can download the software from the Iomega web site. Use the Copy Machine application to duplicate a ZIP disk. You can format a ZIP disk with the Iomega Format, or run applications from a ZIP disk. You can both Read and Write Protect your ZIP disks.You should install the IomegaWare software in Windows 2000 to format ZIP disks so they will be compatible with other Windows operating systems (FAT system). If a ZIP disk is formatted in NTFS it can lock the disk so the eject button on the device does not work. You should always choose the software eject command because of disk caching in Windows 2000 and XP. The ZIP disk provides unlimited storage space within its capacity. Space on a ZIP drive is reused when files are replaced or deleted. The Long Format can correct disk errors or remove protection from files. The 250MB disk can be read and written in the 750MB drive.
For some time now I've been using a pair of Sennheiser PX100s for my home stereo system. And for those who have no idea, they cost about sixty dollars MSRP. And I have once used a Sony MDRV6 and a Sennheiser HD280, so I pretty much know what sounds good and what completely sucks-the-big-one. My PX100s have recently bit the dust and was using a pair of cheap headphones that came with my CD player that sounded much too bright.Two weeks down the line and I met up with the Koss UR21. Now, you're probably reading this confused and perplexed on why I'd only spend twenty bucks and not just get a pair of audiophile headphones that cost four to five times that amount? Well firstly, these were given to me by a friend who certainly dislikes the full-size type of headphones like these and instead prefers the basic over-the-head kind like the PX100s, Sony MDR101LPs, or the Koss UR5. And the funny thing is, this same one came with the Koss P3 earbuds I also reviews. So basically, I was given the entire package free. Talk about overwhelmed. Anyhow, so why am I still using these? And better yet, why am I using this since I gave them one star a couple months back? First, I found I was wearing these incorrectly, and I bet the rest of these reviewers are since they complain about lack of low bass and mid frequencies, while I find them bass-heavy. The very end of the pad should be touching the end of your ear. This will make a very good seal and the sound out of the speakers will come through. And, well, before I was wearing them incorrectly.So how do they sound now? Excellent, amazing for the price. Now, I'm not going to be a boaster saying they sound like the MDRV6 or HD280. Because they do not. Somewhat close, but not. But, I must say these are a great value, and do sound a bit like the Sennheiser PX100s in a way. Slightly warm, with a clear sound. Let's talk about bass. Very decent, at about half volume I'd say they go to about 30Hz, which is more than enough bass for even the picky. Bass is good, but slightly overwhelming. It's not bad, in fact I'm a bass head myself, but audiophiles will likely pass these off as warm sounding". Also the upper bass region seems a bit enhanced and overpowered, but again most people buying headphones in this price range would enjoy a subwoofer to their head. So to sum up, slightly overpowered but great bass. Mids sounded a lot like most Koss headphones, "out-there" without overpowering anything. Especially 200-1k were audiophile quality, which makes rock thrive and make live performances sound more natural. As with almost any pair in this price range, the upper mids were slightly harsh, but nothing intolerable. To add on, treble doesn't roll off one bit, and really does add some solid detail to your music. In overall terms, a solid headphones for the hip-hop/rap lover (because of the great bass) or the live performances craver (because of the solid mids and detail). Not sonically flat, but way better than anything you'll find in this price range, and might please some mild audiophiles.In other terms, these headphones are very comfortable for long usage, but are definitely not for the summer when your ears start to sweat. And, it's likely just me, but the foam pads really make my ears itchy after some time. The headphones seem pretty strudy as long as they aren't bent. The plastic on the sides of the headphones will likely distort over time, but the headphones in general do look pretty cool. Regardless of the Amazon photo, they are more of a dark silver than a white color. The cord is a good four feet, which is very short for me, but I bought an extension cord a long time ago to use with my stereo system, so this is not an issue for me. The headphones also have an L-jack so if you do use these with your iPod or etc, the plug will last much longer than the straight plug that gets bumped around and breaks the plug.Overall, a very, very solid headphone for the very low price, which in full-sized cans is hard to find. Not sonically perfect, no headphone in this price is, but they are better than most. And not to mention they look cool, are comfortable, and are very inexpensive. Overall, a good full-size can for those wanting a good sounding and well-rounded pair of full-sized headphones without spending a ton. 4.5 stars."

I was looking for a basic boombox and after one disastrous model from a no-name maker, I decided to get this Panasonic. I've been quite happy from Day One.First of all, this boombox has pretty good sound for a small audio machine. It also has four preset equalizer settings that's simple to use and does make a difference to sound output. The remote control also has a sound virtualizer" button that allows you to generate 3D effects for the sound output.One thing that makes me happy is the CD player on this boombox can play MP3 files (but you can't shuffle MP3 files as you can shuffle CD tracks). And like all Panasonic CD players, it's very reliable and doesn't even skip when you walk and play. The CD player also spins very fast and is quiet, which is good compared to cheap boomboxes.The cassette player, which I use occasionally, is great, too. One thing to note is it only accepts normal-type audio tapes, not one of those metal or oxide tapes. On the other hand, you can record to tape CD music or broadcast - the old-fashioned way which sure brings back lots of fond memories of the Walkman days.The buttons are clearly laid out and easy to operate. Programming CD tracks in the orders you like is very easy. The radio tuning function works well, too. A built-in, extendable antenna makes it easy to find good FM broadcast. A built-in, foldable handle makes this lightweight boombox easy to carry.The LCD is smallish but it comes on backlit when the boombox is powered-on. There's a built-in clock; you can press the Display button on the remote to activate the clock display anytime. When powered off, the clock shows but is not backlit.Overall, this boombox feels solid and works well. It costs more than many other boomboxes but it does give you much more confidence. I hope to be using it for a long time to come."

The Macintosh experience has long been characterized by efficiency and simplicity. The Apple Lisa and Apple Macintosh introduced the mouse, to the personal computer market in 1983 and 1984.From early in the 1980s until early August 2005, Apple made only a single-button mouse. Many Mac fans actually thank Apple, for the simple design. However, others have been demanding a multi-button mouse with scroll wheel, for years now. That dream became a reality on August 2, 2005, when Apple Computer Inc. introduced Mighty Mouse.However, Mighty Mouse is not your everyday mouse. It features the same shape and form as the Apple Pro Mouse. In fact, the Mighty Mouse makes only one click" movement. The difference here is that a sensor in the Mighty Mouse detects whether the user is clicking the right or left side of the mouse.Primary & Secondary Buttons - The Primary and Secondary clicks work just like any two-button mouse on a Macintosh. In fact, Mac OS X has always worked great with two-button mice, but Mac fans had to use third party mice, if they wanted that functionality. Having a secondary button can save time if you want to use the mouse to bring up contextual menus that you previously had to "control-click" to access.The Scroll Ball - Apple took the scroll wheel to a new level, with their very own scroll "ball." The scroll ball not only allows the vertical scrolling that we have all become accustomed to on the scroll wheel mouses, but it also allows horizontal scrolling, which can definitely be a time saver. Furthermore, the scroll ball has a good "feel" to it. Granted, the horizontal scrolling is a bit more difficult, since our fingers are longer than they are wide, you cannot scroll as much horizontally in a single movement as you can vertically. However, the usefulness is still dramatic.Extra FeaturesThe Mighty Mouse does not stop at being a two-button mouse with revolutionary scroll wheel. If you are running Mac OS X Tiger (version 10.4.2 or above), you can install the software that comes with the Mighty Mouse. The software allows you to customize the Mighty Mouse. You can change which side of the mouse is primary and secondary, if you're left-handed. Furthermore, you can define tasks that are performed, when you click the scroll ball, or squeeze the side buttons. The default, plus probably more useful configuration, is to have clicking the scroll ball bring up Dashboard, with all your widgets. This creates a quick way to access Dashboard, without using your keyboard, or clicking the Dashboard icon in the dock. The side squeeze buttons are default set for Expose All-Windows, which is also very convenient and saves you, from pushing F9. The scroll ball and side squeeze buttons can be changed to open your favorite program, if that suits your needs better.Overall, Mighty Mouse was well worth the wait. Apple has joined the multi-button mouse market, but they did not do so with your everyday boring two-button scrolling mouse. Apple has changed the mouse, with touch-sensitive clicking, a revolutionary scroll ball, and force detecting side-squeeze buttons. You will need Mac OS X Tiger, in order to fully appreciate all of the Mighty Mouse features. However, once you have the Mighty Mouse, you are sure to find yourself more productive than you were with a single-button mouse."
I have purchased Targus products before and have been quite happy with them. I also see them in nearly every major retail store and I have never had any issues with their customer support. Now that they are offered on Amazon.com their pricing is also more aggressive, thus bringing me to a point wherein I would like to make a purchase.However, in my quest to purchase the Targus PDAT01 PDA/Handheld Universal Organizer - Black I discovered that I had a difficult time determining whether or not my device would fit in the Targus PDAT01 PDA/Handheld Universal Organizer - Black. I finally found the interior dimensions (compatibility dimensions) for this product and thought I would share them with you.Compatibility Dimensions: 5.25 inches x 3.5 inches x 0.88 inchesIf your device is exactly the size above or smaller, it will fit. I have owned the Targus PDAT01 PDA/Handheld Universal Organizer - Black for just a few days and I am quite pleased with its workmanship; especially considering the price of the product.P.S. The exterior dimensions are: 6 inches x 4.25 inches 0.88 inchesI hope this review was helpful in determining whether this product is compatible with your device.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Viking 128MB Secure Digital Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

The other reviewers have covered this beginner's digital camera extensivesly. I just want to give you my two cents regarding two issues.1. Lack of optical zoom. For my primary digital camera I demand optical zoom, and no less than 3x of optical zoom. If you travel a lot like I do, optical zoom is a must. If, on the other hand, you shoot a lot of party pictures, it's not as important. The A300 lacks optical zoom, so it's better used as a secondary camera, which is how I use it, kinda like a pocket camera. Two advantages of no optical zoom: 1) the camera operates more quickly, and 2) the lens mechanism won't break as fast.2. Three megapixels. Nowadays even 5MP models have become immensely affordable. A lot of people overlook the facts that 1) most digital pictures never get printed, and 2) you can get great 6x4&quot; prints from 2MP, not to mention 3MP. In fact, you can get great 5x7&quot; or even larger prints from 3MP. On most photo printers, too many megapixels are wasted anyway. What's more important is the overall image quality. There are 5MP cameras that take underexposed and ugly pictures. The A300 continues Canon's tradition of superior image quality.For this price, the A300 is a must-have for gadget lovers and people looking for an easy-to-use starter digicam.
What I like about this product:-- Excellent, top-notch sound output, both through a good set of headphones and through the two analog output jacks in the back of the unit-- Can play WMA format in addition to MP3-- Firewire interface included-- Good battery life: I get about 9 hours, less than the 11 claimed by Creative, but still good-- Ability to add a 2nd battery-- Optical/analog input jack for recordings-- 20GB at an attractive priceWhat I don't like:-- Still too big and too heavy, esp. compared to the 20GB Apple iPod. The iPod uses Toshiba's PC card hard disk, which is much smaller and quieter than the Fujitsu 2.5-inch disk used by Jukebox 3-- Uninspiring styling-- Lacks driver to allow Windows to recognize the device as an external drive. Archos gets A+ for getting this right: all Archos MP3 players can be used as an external drive, plug-n-go. Jukebox 3, in contrast, only comes with a clumsy file transfer tool, unless you buy the commerical third-party software Nomad ExplorerConclusion:A very good value considering it has 20GB of space which allows up to 8000 songs and can be used as external storage (if you can live with the awkward file transfer program). Still too big for the pocket, though.
The BNC connector is very common. Being able to built one into your project has become more difficult since rat shack quit stocking parts in favor of cell phones. Fortunately Amazon was there to the rescue.There are two types of BNCs that I bought for a project, one that uses a double-D hole to prevent rotation and this flange mount design.In the end my project has a professional appearance as I tapped the case for the 4 screws and drilled a clearance hole for the center conductor to pass through. With so many cables terminated in BNC connectors, having a female BNC to connect to them is almost mandatory if you design circuits on your own.You can also go to L-com and get a catalog of all the RF parts they sell here at amazon. Their shipping is very reasonable so I picked up some other connectors I'd needed in the past.
The members of my big family between them own three other Sony boomboxes, and this recent addition was bought purely for the style (and after my very disappointing experience with the Sharper Image Beetle CD Boombox; see my review there for details). The Psyc looks real funky... and Japanese. It reminds me variously of the head of a Power Ranger and the body of this nameless cat in another Japanese anime. Like other Sony boomboxes, it's intuitive to use. The LCD is bigger and more informative than the old models we own. The sound quality is adequate for a small boombox, which is to say you get stereo sound and some fake bass. :) We plan to take this with us when we go picnicking, and outdoors as long as the boombox is loud enough, sound quality is not too important.Our oldest Sony CD boombox has been in service for 13 years... I hope this one lasts just as long.
Ever since my company finally sprang for a new iBook about five months ago, I've been happy as a clam. This 12&quot; model hums, with delightful ergonomics and Apple's fabulous iLife &amp; OS X software suite. This thing is so light at 4.9 pounds that I've essentially stopped using my 7.5 pound, 14&quot; Toshiba clunker, even though the Toshiba is supposedly faster and with a bigger screen. The screen on the iBook is plenty big for 95% of tasks -- from reading web pages to writing reports on the go. It's also exceptionally bright and sharp. OS X's Rendezvous technology, which quickly and easily and automatically connects to networks, printers and Wifi (with the Airport card) is a dream.I particularly love Safari, Apple's user-friendly web browser that doesn't get gunked up with endless popup ads, viruses and other junk. It's so much snappier and less buggy than the Toshiba that sometimes I have to pinch myself.The battery lasts 4 hours -- more than double my Toshiba. And it looks 10 times cooler, to boot. It's the ultimate coffee shop accessory (especially one with free Wifi).And it is especially convenient for me as a reporter on the go. Having 2.6 fewer pounds to lug around every day is great, and it actually feels better on my lap. (I'm currently typing this while lying in bed using my wireless network, which the iBook sensed and connected to automatically). How cool is that?You can find laptops for less, certainly. I bought my Toshiba at a day after Thanksgiving deal at Bestbuy a couple years back for five hundred smackers. But you won't find one that is this light, with this great battery life and this ease of use anywhere else. And when you are basically talking about an extension of your brain, eleven hundred smackers is pretty darn cheap.Enjoy!

When I first reviewed the sleek Visor Edge, it cost about twice what it does today. At the time, I advised buyers that this product was definitely going to come down in price so it can compete. Handspring finally has priced this product where it is extremely competitive with any product in the marketplace.Functionally, the Visor Edge's sole advantage is its thinness. It is by far the thinnest PDA.Functionally, the Edge is identical to the Visor Neo, except it is thinner with a rechargeable battery. This is the Palm OS equivalent of the Apple Cube -- a beautiful machine that didn't justify its high initial cost. As with the Cube after it was discontinued, you can now get a great deal on the Edge.Buyers may also want to check out the discontinued Palm Vx, which feels better in your hands and actually weighs about an ounce less.BTW, putting the Springboard module on this product makes it look totally unwieldy and eliminates the &quot;cool&quot; factor. If you like Springboard, keep your Visor Deluxe/Neo.

I was pretty much looking for any inexpensive wireless mouse and keyboard. I saw this to be one of the most inexpensive (I won't say cheap) ones avaliable.As far as communciation, so far it has been excellent. The mouse took a restart to connect but everything connected and went smoothly.The keyboard is pretty much your standard keyboard but with additional features. The media feature does not seem to work, my guess is that it works for MusicMatch since it is on the CD. The play/pause button will pause and play your music, this worked in all of my music programs (Windows Media and RealPlayer). The mute and voulme controls worked perfectly. There is a favorites button to open your browser's favorites, the e-mail button open Outlook Express, and the www button goes to your home page.The mouse is your basic mouse with a scroll. So far it has been very accurate with the reciever, though don't be too suprised if your photo editing gets rough a few times. It is optical and it does not need a trackball and uses a laser.One of the negatives is the battery life. It is around the area were AA batteries last, which is 15-20 hours. This is ok for some users, but for people using the computer daily for a few hours, that would mean you would have to replace the mouse around 2 times a week, which could get costy. The keyboard doesn't run the entire time you use the computer so it shouldn't be too bad.It is compatible with Windows 95 and above as well as the latest Mac operating systems. The keyboard can be run on USB or the PS/2 Port but the mouse must use the PS/2. The USB is the slim long port and the PS/2 port (usually colored) is the circle port.As far as the CD, it contains software but chances are your computer has them already from the Control Panel. There is some adware along with the CD as well. I wold just leave the install CD alone and just plug-and-play.Overall, this set does have a few quirks, but it is definitely worth the low-cost. 4 stars.
The new VX-3000 is one of the best webcams I've used. I considered the $99 VX-6000, too, but decided it was too expensive for my needs. The best thing with the VX-3000, compared to Logitech and Creative models, is it does *not* install tons of hidden drivers, hidden DLLs, and hidden spyware; the Logitech and Creative installation utilities place tons of hidden stuff on your hard drive. The VX-3000's was a very clean installation.I use Windows Live Messenger (aka MSN Messenger 9.0) so I get seamless integration, although I've seen people use it painlessly with Skype. It has the best webcam image quality I've seen. Windows Live Messenger has been rated by various PC magazines to be the best video chat client software, and I always had good results with Creative and Logitech cameras in the past (using MSN Messenger, which has been rebranded as Windows Live Messenger, or WLM). The VX-3000 bests them all in terms of ease of use and video quality. The built-in mic is also lightyears ahead of the yesteryear models.In short, this is a great webcam that won't disappoint you (unless you are a fanatical anti-American or anti-Microsoftie.)
These TDK 8 cm (3 in.) DVD-R blanks are to be used mostly in DVD camcorders from Panasonic, Sony and Hitachi. I use them in my beloved Panasonic VDR-D300 3CCD DVD camcorder (see my review of the camcorder on Amazon). These DVD-R blanks are pre-formatted so all I need to do is pop one into my Panasonic and start shooting. I shoot at the highest quality setting (called XP" on the Panasonic) which gives me about 18 minutes of recording time. After I'm done with one disk, I finalize it on the Panasonic which makes it playable in all DVD players as well as most computer DVD-ROM drives. (The only DVD drives not compatible with 8 cm discs are those that suck the disc in. These small discs must be used in tray-loading or cartridge-loading drives. Very few people, other than some Apple computer owners, have those sucking drives.)The TDK discs, manufactured by a Taiwanese company for TDK, are quite reliable. I've gone through two dozen and have not encoutnered any problems. The only unknown is shelf life of these discs. I make backup copies of my videos both on hard drives and on a regular DVD-R. Because your own home video recordings are not encrypted, you can simply copy the files on the TDK disc to a blank regular-sized DVD-R via Windows Explorer. It's really simple.Of course, since these are R discs, they can be used only once. If you want a rewritable RW blank, check out the TDK Camcorder DVD-RW 3-pack."
I had to get a replace for my older Hewlett Packard printer. The only guidelines were it had to be an all-in-one printer (with scanner and copier), and it could not be a HP. A saw this model at an office supplies store and I'd thought I would give it a shot since I've never had problems with Canon products and the feature:price ratio of this machine was beyond most, if not all in its price range.The printer is large. Not up to so large I can't use it" standards, but it's definitely too big for an executive printer, or maybe one that would want it in a college dorm room, for example. For home use this printer is larger than most but not terrible. This Canon MP460 machine has a good amount of features. If you are looking for a more inexpensive and bare-bones machine, I'd suggest the Canon MP160 instead, as it is twenty dollars less but you'll have to remove the cool little screen, memory card readers, and the better print quality you get from the mid-level multifunction. The MP460 printer is simple to install, plug in the USB cord (NOT included) and the power cord and install the software from the CD. If you just want the drivers and don't want all of the software, I'd go for the "custom" install since you then get to choose what goes on your PC. For the features, you get a printer, scanner, and copier, along with the memory card reader and a little status screen. The printer is very user-friendly (now I remember why I picked Canon again) and it is easy to access all of the printer's features, although installing the printer cartridges took a bit of thinking. The print and copy quality is decent. Not lab or studio quality, but very good performance that was noticeably standout of other printers in this price range. I printed out a few images from my camera, and although I thought some of the images could have been brighter, they were above expected for a sub-$100. Copies were on the level of the photo prints, good quality prints all the time. You also get a decent scanner, although not of spectacular quality, proved better than the similar-priced HP machine. It's a little slow, and as another reviewer mentioned, it takes 20 seconds or so for start-up for the first print. You can adjust the print speed, but in sacrifice of print quality. (although in my opinion, very little) It's not too noisy, but there is a quiet mode you can put it on, in sacrifice of print speed. The paper-feed is the basic, and almost never has problems. (Unless it is the paper) Ink doesn't run out too fast, for the little ink cartridges that come with the printer lasted about 300-something pages, so I'd guess the normal ink cartridges would last about 400 to 500. The memory card reader is very useful if you have a camera. It takes a good amount of cards, like CompactFlash, Microdrive, Memory Stick, Memory Stick PRO, SD, and SmartMedia, and many others. There is also a way to print wirelessly through Bluetooth technology, however this is an add-on and must be purchased beforehand.All in all, if you don't mind a larger printer, and you are looking for a well-priced multifunction printer, this Canon is for you. 4 stars."
Previously you had to purchase what seemed like a different tool for every coax type connector. Paladin finally made a truly universal tool that handles rca (with the center pin), normal CATV, and BNC plus handle both rg-59 and rg-6. I've had other so called universal tools that could not do bnc because of the connector size, but paladin made room to get it in and out of the tool.This kit is a good deal because you get alot of prep tools in one outfit.Be aware that paladin connectors are great quality but are priced accordingly. they come in 10 packs, 50 packs, and I've seen a 100 pack so if you do alot of terminations, shop around for the best sized package of connectors and be sure that the connectors are matched to your cable.Note that Rg-6 and rg-6 quad shield both use the same connector.
I had 2 of these connected together and was fully expecting to get some 60 cycle harmonics in my audio signal. When I reviewed it in soundbooth looking at 120, 180, 240 etc, there were no spikes, and my ear confirmed what I was seeing - no noise. On the day I had to run the 2 100 feet, it was raining to further complicate things when I noticed that their xlr connectors had a nice rubber o-ring in the link to seal out water.At the end of the day I wiped it down and packed it away - these are a keeper and I may buy another set for the value.
It is a replacement inkjet cartridge. It works as well as one would expect. I have never used a different type cartridge to see if the colors are different with this printer. I have used a couple of these replacement cartridges, and they are excellent.

With the new, lower price on the Sony SJ30, there is now no reason to buy Palm-branded color models unless you prefer their form factor or want wireless capability.The CLIE SJ30 provides everything you want in a Palm --1) High resolution, brilliant color screen has 4 times the pixels of similarly-priced Palm models.2) Long-lasting lithium battery.3) A robust 16MB of memory, plenty to run all the Palm programs you could care for including the three I consider essential: Mapopolis (a mapping program from Mapopopolis.com with keyword-searchable street maps), Avantgo (an online news service that downloads articles to your palm) and Vindigo (a restaurant, movie and city guide).The CLIE models, which start at just over a hundred clams, have a nice form factor, though not quite as elegant as the Palms, and upper-level models feature the best high-res color screens for less than what you'd pay for a similar PALM-branded model. But I've heard Sony's customer service is weak compared to Palm's easy-as-pie returns. These things do break from time to time, so keep that in mind.Here's a basic PALM product guide:Zire/Palm m100: Bottom of the line. Designed to suck you in but leave you wanting more. Think of this as the Chevy Chevette of Palms. Plagued by small screens.Palm m105: The 8MB version of the m100. Fine, except needs batteries and plagued by small screen.Palm 125: Ooh, expansion slot that you will probably never use. Still plagued by small screen.Palm 130: Adds color, lithium battery to m125. Not bad, but screen still small, low res.Palm m500: Still the standard for monochrome Palms. Lightweight, with a clear, large screen and a classic form-factor that gave the company its name. 8MB, expandable, lithium-polymer battery. Triple-Aces.Palm m505: Discontinued color model features horrible washed out color screen. AVOID.Palm m515: Soon to be discontinued Color PALM. Very good, but no Palm TUNGSTEN T. Expensive.Palm TUNGSTEN T: The top of the line. Finally, Palm builds a PALM that can compete with a Pocket PC. Too bad they priced it like one too. Triple Aces design, with fabulous ergonomics, fantastic high-res active screen, battery, bluetooth, and drop-down graffiti pad. BUT, model due out next year will have phone function too.Also check out the new Handspring Treo models, which feature thumbpads and a small form factor (some with phones).
IOMEGA ZIP 250 MB USB PoweredThis ZIP250USBPCMBP device allows both storage and transfer of data at a high rate of speed. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks may be replaced to provide vast storage within the 250Mb limit. This transfer is about as fast as an internal IDE ZIP device. The 250 unit can read and write the more popular 100Mb ZIP disks as well (but can't do a Long Format). You should use the EJECT command instead of the eject button because of write caching by the operating system.The User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on a ZIP disk. The "Long Format" repairs a 250 disk with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details.An Iomega ZIP USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). This is the optimal unit for most people. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as they are useful to you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system if the software is incompatible.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics."
This laptop by Sony has been good to me for a while now and I recommend it for people who are on the go but yet do not need the very latest and greatest in technology. The Intel Centrino processor works fine. I have no complaints although, of course, at 1.5 GHz it's not the fastest processor out there. It works fine for me, though. The RAM I added to have the laptop be able to use a full gigabyte of RAM has not interfered with hibernation, as another reviewer experienced.The case DOES scratch easily; and the sound is fair. I use earphones that let me increase the sound beyond what the computer is capable of producing; and that's an obvious plus. The keyboard is much tighter and smaller than a desktop keyboard and this took some getting used to. I wound up buying a mouse to avoid that pad upon which you slide your finger to control the cursor and mouse pointer on the screen.You will need a special cleaner to wash the screen--this screen is not made of glass but fortunately the cleaning products are relatively affordable.In addition, I really like that this comes with a combination CDRW--DVD drive. I have often used this to watch movies while I travel or lie in bed just lazing around on a Sunday afternoon. The drive works very well and there are no software issues so far for me.As Amazon notes, you get Norton anti-virus software and Microsoft Works with this and all this and more runs on the Windows XP Home Edition operating system, which is fine with me. There are ports and more to make this laptop exactly the way you personally want it to be. Excellent!Overall, this laptop is very solid. Sure, the smaller keyboard took some getting used to; but that came in time. This little computer's got a lot of life in it; and I think you'll be able to make good use of it. If you still have any questions, you can download the product manual from this website or you can also read the product description above. The other reviews are well done, too.
It works great, The seller Eforcity shipped out the same day, Lightning fast shipping. Thanks arrived exactly as described. Repeat customer never dissapointed.
I've purchased 2 of the 50 foot cables for 2 installs now and find these to be of great quality. The cable is very thick and well constructed. In one installation it was used to go from a ceiling mounted conference room HD projector down to a podium and in the other application I used it to go from my den where my HTPC is kept to the living room where it is viewed (with an HDMI splitter on both installs). They worked perfectly allowing my primary display to be in 2 places at the same time.The only disadvantage is that my monitor on DVI is 1920x1200 but drops to 1920x1080 to conform with the HD video standard when using HDMI video in. This is probably why the 1920x1200 resolution is not as common any more since you get black bars when feeding it an HDMI link. When running complex applications such as video editors those extra pixels are of value but that has nothing to do with this cable. The cable far exceeds my expectations for its price and has performed well for 6 months now.Note when installing the cable it is stiff and needs a good bending radius to go up into walls, etc.
I was shocked to find this high-quality 1GB SD card for such a great price on Amazon (sold by a third-party seller). I bought one a while ago for more than twice the current price and have been very satisfied with its reliability. I'm ordering another one for my new Garmin Nuvi GPS unit. I highly recommend this SD card. You can't go wrong.
There are a few key features I'll highlight to illustrate why this is a 5 star item.1 - you can use 1 or 2 battery packs. Canon has done this a long time ago. The camera gets bigger but the runtime does too2 - There is a convenient storage hook inside it to hold the trapdoor that you used to use to remove and charge the battery3 - This is the LAST camera to use an electronic (READ: NOT USB) shutter release. All future E series cameras are going to a USB based remote shutter release, which means random delays in timing and difficulty shooting lightning or timing more than one camera to shoot simultaneously. The RM-CB1 remote shutter release & lock NEEDS this accessory to be used on the E300 - without it there is no jack to plug in the RM-CB1 (a simple two position copy of the camera's shutter button on a 3 foot cable)This sungs up good with the camera on the tripod screw and provides another nut for you to mount a tripod to the camera. It feels like it was part of the camera, but despite its light weight, the second battery will make you notice a heavier camera.The number of shots between charging pretty much doubles with this making it a very helpful tool. Also, flash charging time (internal) is faster, and autofocus motors run better with 2 parallel batteries than just one. The E300 system runs better with this hooked up. You'll also have more time when the battery turns red" to shoot due to the 2 battery packs.NOTE: a second battery doesn't come with this - order the battery if you don't have a second already.For doing electronic shutter release, you need to get the focus and exposure already set (i.e. the half press of the button) - to do this I cut open a RM-CB1 and installed a small switch to short the BROWN wire to ground so the camera would think I had the 1/2 press already done - then I focus and get ready for the final shot. Shorting the red wire to ground fires the shutter right away with no appreciable lag.All future cameras in the E series use USB remote shutter releases. If you are focused on infinity with a 1/4 sec exposure and f 5.6 for lightning, you'll get random results on the usb release system even though it does the same thing the electronic one does.That's all!"
[...]Lexar's 80x Pro CompactFlash cards are fast, especially if you use them with digital cameras that are compatible with Lexar's write acceleration" (WA) technology. While popular dSLRs like the Canon Digital Rebel and EOS 10D and 20D and the Nikon D70 do not take advantage of the WA technology, they still benefit tremendously from Lexar's high-speed architecture. In fact, in order to use the dSLR's burst modes, you need a high-speed CF card like this.If you happen to own an camera (Kodak, Sanyo, some Nikons, etc. - check Lexar's website) that's WA-compatible, you'll see even greater speed boosts. From my in-store testing (since I can't afford to buy all these dSLRs!) it was hard to see the difference between WA-enabled vs. WA-disabled, since the cameras were all different. Other reviews (not that guy Brent's generic "how many pictures on a card" crap) have claimed WA does make a difference. To tell the truth, I wouldn't concern myself with this WA thing; I think it's more a marketing gimmick then real technology. Luckily, Lexar works very fast even in non-WA-compatible cameras.Should you get a Lexar or Sandisk? I think it's toss-up. In the old days (read, a couple years ago) Sandisk had some serious QA problems, leading to tons of defective memory cards, but that seems a thing of the past. My recommendation: buy whichever that's cheaper."
Most Canon digital cameras still use the CompactFlash memory card. CompactFlash is much thicker and larger than the Secure Digital card used in the SD100 (this model). It's cheaper per-megabyte, but is slower and draws more power. Canon is doing a good thing by using the increasingly dominant SD format in this dimunitive digital camera.Function-wise this camera is a good point-and-shoot replacement. You won't find many manual controls (beyond the usual exposure comp, white balance, flash control, and a few other common controls), but it's a good &quot;pick up and snap away&quot; camera. 2X optical zoom is rather inadequate for any semi-serious photographers who travel a lot, but ok if you just carry this to events and parties.Picture quality is much better than my first-generation S100 digital elph camera from a couple years ago. I still find the exposure a bit on the underside and the color tone a bit on the cold side. If you want top-notch picture quality, consider the 4-MP Canon S400 which has excellent image quality and color balance.In summary, this is a very capable digital camera in a great form factor. It's light and easy to carry, and does a fine job as long as you don't do serious photogrpahy with it.
The news of the release of the 4th-gen iPods prompted me to visit the local Apple store. After waiting for three other guys I got a chance to play with the new iPod. I'd say the styling is slightly sharper than previous models. The overall physical dimension does feel a bit smaller, and this is a boon to all those who were salivating after the Mini's small form factor. The front of the iPod only has the click wheel. While I appreciate the simplicity, my playing with it revealed that it's still a little confusing to use, and I had trouble controlling the speed, sometimes frustratingly overshoot or undershoot in my selection. Also, the metal on the sides will catch lots of finger prints.Still, for someone who doesn't own an iPod yet, the new models are the most tempting so far.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SimpleTech STI-PRO/512 ProX High-Speed 512MB CompactFlash Card, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this 512MB card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
This record player is really a very good buy considering what you get. Sure, the sound from the single speaker is only about a B+," but if you really want that retro feel and look in every way, including the stackable records feature so reminiscent of the '60s, then this is one of your best choices.It doesn't take up much room and it plays the records very well. You can stack a few albums up (maybe not more than five, though) and just walk away, letting the records spin and the music roll through your house for the duration of five or six sides worth of records! (I wouldn't recommend stacking 78 rpm records; they might be too fragile for that and should be played one at a time.)The wood grain quality looks a little cheap and the iron mesh grille in the front covering the speaker is certainly not the best. Of course you knew that diamond stylus needle wouldn't be the very best diamond stylus needle you could ever buy, either. Nevertheless, it IS a diamond stylus needle--and it IS a sturdy record player.But that's not what you're really buying here. The selling point of this turntable, this record player is the nostalgia, that feeling you get and the memories you recall when you see and hear it play your records. If you're like me and you kept your record albums all these years, you DO value nostalgia and therefore you'll be pleased. After all, it's not like turntables are growing on trees anymore, so this is one of the few opportunities we have left for us record lovers!This model allows you to play 33 1/3 rpm, 45 rpm and even 78 rpm records that are 7 inches, 10 inches or 12 inches in width. There is an automatic return arm and this is a great plus!Overall, this really is a wonderful record player for those of us who remember yesteryears fondly and who want the look and styling of record players from the '50s and especially the '60s. It is not a modern turntable used in clubs in jet set cities; but chances are if you're considering this product a modern day turntable requiring speakers and other equipment isn't what you wanted anyway. I recommend this as an affordable "retro" record player that does the job well and will work well through time. It also comes with six 45 spindle adapters and a user's manual that's actually written in plain English!Enjoy this for years to come! SMILES"
Every one of my service trucks comes with standard equipment - a power inverter, dewalt charger, deep cycle battery, rj-45 crimp tool, cat 5 wire, and of course these plugs or ice cubes" as they are called in the industry. The trucks have accessories like a bright dewalt work light for after hours calls and cable testers, coax crimpers, coax testers, and adapters needed to make it all come together.This is a fine quality crimp connector with insulation displacement teeth on the gold plated fingers, along with a crimp lock that grabs the cable securely.I use probably 6 of these myself a day - in my trucks they go through them like candy. The important part is we can do any cat 5 install we need anywhere anytime. We've had no re-crimps and no problems with this connector. We keep a constant stock on hand in all trucks and all IT cubicles."
The TG50 finally puts Palm devices in the same league as Pocket PCs in terms of multimedia features, but the multimedia applications are developed by third parties and thus feel a little bit less integrated than built-in Palm OS functions. The TG50 comes with TONS of software, but it also means the interface is quite cluttered, making it difficult to find something esp. for new users. The lack of the Graffiti area also takes a little getting used to. Finally, the screen is very high resolution and bright, but too small, so if you are over 35, you may find the screen next to unreadable.All in all, this is a well integrated device that gives you tons to do with your PDA: videos, images, MP3's, plus office apps. The thumboard is usable. I'd say in the multimedia department the Pocket PC feels more mature and stable, but the TG50 is a solid contender.
I bought the HL150 with the HS430, because if I liked one, I could take it back. Let me tell you, the HS430 is going back to Target, pronto.SOUND QUALITY - Very good. The bass is pretty deep, and the highs are very clear. I can hear stuff that I couldn't hear from the MDR101LP from Sony. Also, these are LOUD!!! These are even louder than the Panasonic Wrap-Its! I'm serious. These are a true buy if you hate the headphones that came with your quiet player.COMFORTABILITY - Very comfortable. Then yet, I've never seen the overhead style be uncomfortable. Because there the fold up ear-cup style, the are able to exactly match the ear.PORTABILITY - They don't fold up the bend way. They fold up across, which is a bit awkward, but they do fold up, and they are very portable.COST - I'd rather pay $9 for these, than pay for the Sony brand. I just like the Philips brand so much better because they're loud, have great sound, and are comfortable.OVERALL - These are a great deal for people looking for new overhead type headphones. Look no futher, these are a great pick, and can fit into any budget!
Good ink, but expensive for the number of pages it prints. But you know what, I'll never buy third-party ink, since they have a very high failure rate and can kill your inkjet printer in a blink of the eye.
Maxell manufactures excellent 120 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and just about anything else. These tapes have 120 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 60 blank minutes for recording on each side. This is useful when recording one hour radio talk shows, for example.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.There is one disappointment; however. These tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Moreover, cassette tapes--especially the 120 minute kind with its thinner than usual tape--can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you decide to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a superior choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for years and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell 120 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.

It's frustrating for me to read useless reviews from people who either do not have the product or trash companies for allegedly not sending them the rebate check. First of all, you should never buy a product based on rebate promises, because if your rebate form gets lost in the mail, they are not responsible. Second, as the recent Dilbert cartoon points out, rebate items probably have inflated prices anyway.In the case of the Kogi L4AX I got my rebate check after a little over two months. I followed the instructions very closely, and sent in both the invoice and the packing slip and carefully circled the monitor, the price I paid, Amazon's name, and the purchase date. I also made a copy of everything just in case.Now about the monitor. This is definitely a cheap monitor, both in image quality, construction, and the after-rebate price. I'll be honest: this is not worth the original, inflated price. The rebate is a must if you were to buy this monitor. While 14&quot; of viewable space is not bad -- at 1024x768 (native resolution) you get razor-sharp text -- this monitor has viewing angles narrower than even Kogi's own 17&quot; offerings (which lag behind rival products from NEC, Sharp, etc.). Color saturation is actually not bad, as you get red reds and blue blues, unlike many of the KDS LCD monitors I've seen at higher prices. The response time (i.e., the time required to draw each pixel) is pretty slow, evidenced by the ghost trails when you play games. But, for those on a budget and with a tight desktop space, this is a good choice, provided, once again, on your getting the rebate. If you can spare a bit more money, go with a 15&quot; or bigger. My recommended brands are NEC/Mitsubishi (best quality and good value), Sharp (expensive, though), Eizo, and ViewSonic.
iBook is the consumer notebook computer, which Apple offers. I actually custom-configured mine at Apple.com, so mine varies slightly from the specs of the standard model listed here. It is the same G4 processor, but I have a 60 GB hard drive, airport extreme card, bluetooth module, and I upgraded the iBook to 768 MB of memory.This iBook is a great way to step into the world of Mac. However, even a veteran Mac user will find an iBook a great machine. Do not allow the 1.07 GHZ chip to scare you. This is a capable machine. Furthermore, you can view all your favorite DVDs and burn CDs. The size of the iBook is one of the fantastic features. This notebook is small and light. I use my iBook all over the house with the airport extreme card I added. I might sit at the dining room table, on the couch, on the living room floor, in the office, or in my bedroom.I do recommend you add some memory to the iBook, which can add yourself. The owners manual provides some instructions. I would recommend adding a 512 MB stick, which will bring you up to 768 MB, but even adding a 256 MB stick, would be good.The iBook obviously runs Mac's OS X Panther (operating system). OS X is fantastic, with a lot of great features such as expose, iCalendar, Sherlock, etc. However, the iBook includes other Apple software titles too. iLife '04 is included, which has iTunes, iPhoto, IMovie, and iDVD. iMovie and iDVD are the easiest consumer applications for making movies and burning DVDs. They are fantastic. Everyone loves iTunes, and iPhoto is hands down the best way to organize your photos. What is so great about this? You're iBook is ready for all of this out of the box! Finally, Appleworks is included with the iBook. Appleworks is a somewhat out of date program, but it can still get your word processing, spreadsheet, and other tasks performed. However, if you want a top quality office suite, I would recommend you purchase Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac.Back to the hardware, the video out on the iBook is the only thing somewhat less than satisfactory in my opinion. It has a mini-DVI output, and it includes an adapter, so you can connect an external display for mirroring via VGA connector. However, the notebook's LCD must remain on the same time, cutting your video memory in half. It isn't a huge problem for me, but the iBook does not have the extended desktop feature, when using an external monitor, that the Powerbook enjoys.Overall, the iBook 1.07 GHZ G4 system is an amazingly portable notebook computer with acceptable performance. The included Apple software will keep you occupied, organized, and entertained.
This Belkin 6' IEEE 1394 cable is a very solid cable, with a male 4-pin (i.Link") connector on one end and a male 6-pin ("Firewire") connector on the other. It supports the full speed (400Mbps) of the IEEE 1394 specification, and looks durable.You should beware of the no free shipping policy on this cable when sold by Amazon -- it does not count toward the $25 free shipping promotion. I used 1-click to order this and was charged close to six bucks for shipping. Ouch. Still, the total was much less than the cheapest price elsewhere, on the web or in stores."
QUICK UPDATE: Sunforce is selling obsolete Sharp 12% efficient panels no longer in production at 123W/panel, 2 panels to a kit with a junky inverter and charge controller.. See my review atSunforce 39126 246-Watt High-Efficiency Polycrystalline Solar Power Kitbut choose cautiosly as that product is from 2008 and is now obsolete which makes expansion of your system difficult due to the efficiency change.---back to the review as it stood originally---In evaluating solar panels (and systems of many panels) the typical pricepoint is $5.10/watt in high volume production. If you are finding better pricing than that something is wrong.An example may be inefficient panels that use larger panels, causing massive panel size such that it is 4-8 times larger than this panel with the same output.Other inefficiencies to watch out for are caused by voltages that are not useful. You could, for example, have a panel that output 500V at 1/10 A for 50W sold for $250 - looks good financially but very few charge controllers go much over 250 volts (and many dont make 250 volts - some are 12 or 48 volt systems). So that panel is not much useThis panel is in the sweet spot - enough power to be useful (80W/3 is a simple approximation for what useful power you can get with a battery all day long - about 25W or so given inefficiences. So theoretically it could support a 25W load 24x7 with an 8 hour day of sun.The last inefficiencies to watch out for are panels that need heavy sun before they produce any output. Some panels produce usable (1-2 amps) output with just ambient scattered light such as a foggy day, while others give near zero output unless the sunlight strikes them head on. This panel design gives output whenever there is light, which is good. More light is always better, but it could be worse.So to sum it up - there are no pitfalls here. It passes all the checks for pricing and performance. We load tested a string of 12 of these for a customer to profile their output to help decide if a rotator would help and it showed that very little gain would come from the expense of an automatic rotation system due to the panel's efficiency at many angles. With 12 panels we produced 1KW for 8 hours with taper up and down on both sides.Best of all this can be used in series strings for grid tie systems or with battery maintainers
I do alot of work with XLR and have my xlr&lt;>RCA male cables for dealing with single ended sources. None of the cables however are made with a female RCA on the rca side, so I ordered a set of these to go with the cables - they were half price on the amazon gold box sale so a good overall value.Now combined with my XLR &lt;> RCA(M) cables I also get XLR &lt;> RCA (F) as well, which I've found helpful with pre-cabled devices that have a RCA (M) output only and the cable is attached.It's a good gadget to have in your cable and adapter bag, but the higher price now makes it a lesser value, though the quality is still exceptional and I still recommend you get a good set of rca professional connectors to avoid scratchy audio. These fit the bill just fine.
I have two of these 8GB babies and use one in my PSP Slim and the other in my Sony VAIO UX280P micro PC. On the PSP I loaded 5GB with movies and TV as well as my favorite MP3s, and leave over 2GB for game saves. The speed of the memory stick on both devices (the PSP and the UX280P) is quite good. (Sony also sells high-speed" cards with red markings, which are about 50% faster but also 50% more expensive.) I don't know if this 8GB memory stick is ReadyBoost-capable on Vista; I have a 4GB version which supports ReadyBoost in my Sony FE-series laptop at work.I own quite a number of Sony memory stick media and they've always been reliable. I've dropped them, stepped on them (actually my son did that more often), and they still work."
I put 4 photos in the pics showing the detail of the connector quality. For a two dollar ish cable it offers 100% compatibility with my pc's toslink output and my toslink optical to rca output converter's input jack. The cost of this fiber (really a lightpipe - fiber optics are usually very precise 62.5/125 micron glass fibers - much smaller than the lightpipe size used in toslink) and 2 connectors is great - it arrived on a saturday by us mail in an envelope marked do not bend with extra postage.Overall I'm very happy with this cable - I've used it at 192 khz, 24 bit, 2 channel output from my pc and into my marantz PMD-661Marantz PMD661 Portable SD RecorderCables should be priced reasonably, and this is very reasonable.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk SDSDB-128-A10 Secure Digital 128MB, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.

This is pretty much the perfect trackball I had been looking for. It feels comfortable whether your hand is small or big (I have medium-sized hands myself). The only minor downside is it's for right-handed folks only, but most southpaws should find it easy to use, too.The best thing about the optical trackball is you never have to clean the inside. I've been using it for a couple months now and the movement is always precise. The buttons are responsive. Even though it's pricy, I think the Trackball Explorer is worth every penny.(For $20 cheaper, you can get the Microsoft Trackball Optical, but I don't like rolling the ball with my thumb.)
Measuring at an incredibly small 0.8 x 1.0 x 0.07 inches, xD picture cards are a new flash storage format jointly developed by Fuji and Olympus, the two largest manufacturers of digital cameras in the world, as a futuristic successor to the SmartMedia card. The xD cards are actually manufactured by Toshiba, known for its promotion of the competing Secure Digital (SD) flash storage format, and are about 1/3 the size of a SmartMedia card and slightly smaller than SD and MMC cards. (Confused by the alphabet soup yet?)Sidebar: xD stands for extreme digital"But smallness does not mean lameness. Fuji and Olympus promise very high read/write speeds (3MB/sec for writes and 5MB/sec for reads) as well as lower power consumption for the xD cards. They also claim that eventually xD's capacity will reach 8GB (!!!), although no timetable has been set. Right now xD cards come in 32MB, 64MB, 128MB and 256MB flavors, and generally cost 50% more than same-capacity SD cards, but their prices are likely to drop quickly as more digital cameras accept the format.Which brings us to the critical question, how many digital cameras accept xD cards? Not many at this point, and digital cameras that accept SmartMedia cannot use xD. But given the market clout of Olympus and Fuji, we'll surely see more xD-friendly models soon. The question is whether other camera producers (Canon, Nikon, Kodak, Toshiba...) will also adopt the technology. My prediction is since Canon has made a commitment to continued use of CompactFlash, they are unlikely to go with the xD. Toshiba manufactures xD cards for Fuji and Olympus, so they may adopt it if they see serious commitment by the latter two.Since so far few cameras use the xD format, there is little real-world comparison between xD and competing formats such as SD and Sony's MemoryStick/MemoryStick PRO. Whether you'll need xD is entirely dependent on whether the digital camera you choose will accept it. My advice is pick a digital camera without regard to the storage format it takes, because all the formats out there -- SD, MMC, SM, CF, MS, and now xD -- get the job done."
These printer cartridge were first rate and factory fresh, awesome, take my word for it!
I work as an audio engineer so my cable kit must be able to match oddball connectors into mixing panels or recorders. The RCA plug is a very popular single ended interface (non-differential), and often must be connected to a differential input of a mixer or recorder.I've trusted HOSA's matching cables for home level equipment for many years now. They make a quality product that does not skimp on manufacturing anywhere. This adapter is no different.When going from single ended to differential you stand the potential of inserting noise into the signal if you use poor quality adapters. Fortunately with the HOSA cables and adapters this has never been a problem for me, which is why I prefer to buy that brand (I buy a couple of other cable brands as well, but HOSA is near the top of my list.)These stubby adapters take up very little space on the back of a mixing console or recorder. They are a high quality way to match signals on RCA cables from CD/DVD systems to digital recorders or mixers.
Simple Tech makes this impressive RAMBUS 128MB RIMM. My computer dramatically increased its speed and performance. It's got a great price and was easy to install. Upgrading is an easier and cheaper solution than buying a brand new computer.
The 5883H is a combination transmitter (which must be enabled with dipswitch 6) and a high capacity receiver for ademco systems. For $100, it's a great deal, but it also enables the system to be expanded into the wireless keypad (see my review5839 Wireless Bi-Directional Alpha Keypad). The wireless keypad mimics all the features of the wired keypad when plugged into a wall outlet or can be run on a 9V battery. With a full 2 line alpha display it informs you of all actions happening on your system.The ONLY way to use a full alpha wireless keypad is to have a 5883H wireless tranceiver setup in your system, so that makes this unit special. It combines a 5800TM with a H series 5800 receiver into one product and increases value by so doing.Note: You must put your system into walk test" mode before programming your new keypad otherwise it will not register with the panel. You must also setup a keypad ID for the wireless keypad and program it on the panel as a full alpha 2 line keypad. Exit the walk test mode to complete the entry of the keypad.The price offered here is 50% off the retail pricing."
Iomega ZIP 100 Drive Parallel PortThis device has been in use since the mid-1990s. It allows both storage and transfer since it works on any parallel port, which should be defined as bi-directional" or "EPP". For best results, you should run the "Parallel Port Accelerator" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like with a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. Most printers will operate from the printer port on this unit. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn't work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first ("daisy chaining"). This changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CD-roms. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). Both units have been proven useful over time. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as it works for you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: "SCSI controllers", "Iomega", "Iomega Parallel Port Interface", then "Finish".You should set the Printer Port as EPP or ECP.Then modify the 'Settings' for the Iomega Parallel Port Interface as follows.The port settings assumes the usual I/O address.'My Computer'; 'Properties'; 'System Devices'; 'Device Manager';'SCSI Controllers'; 'Iomega Parallel Port Interface'; 'Properties'; 'Settings'/mode:eppecr /port:378 /speed:6"
I've had the T100 for just a few days (including a weekend of heavy shooting). I love it. Compared to similar offerings from Panasonic, Canon, Fuji, to name a few, it's expensive, but it has these following features that I find useful -- and they do work well in the real world:- Excellent picture quality: you buy a digital camera to shoot great-looking pictures, right? The T100 takes excellent pictures indoors and outdoors; like other Sony digicams, it's especially good at taking scenery photos- Face detection: automatically sets focus and exposure optimally for light-skinned faces in the picture; seems to work well in well-lit scenes- Optical image stabilization (SteadyShot"): helps you steady slow-shutter shots; saves you about 1 f-stop; only Canon and Panasonic besides Sony use this kind of sophisiticated, non-digital technology- 5x optical zoom: the highest among ultra-slim digital cameras; zoom range is 35mm-175mm equivalent in a 35mm film camera- Zoom optically while shooting video: I'd been wanting this since the first day (over eight years ago) I got my first digital camera (a Fuji); yes, you can zoom the lens smoothly and *optically* (as opposed to digitally) while shooting in movie mode- 3" super-bright LCD: the regular brightness level is pretty usable outdoors, but if you're shooting in bright sunlight, you can crank up the LCD brightness even further (at the expense of shortened battery life, of course)- Decent battery life: rated at 340 shots per charge by the Japanese CIPA standard; this translates into pretty good real-world battery life- Some manual controls available: EV compensation, etc.- Gorgeous design: and yes, I got this red version :)So is this worth almost $400 for an 8-megapixel camera? For me, the 5x zoom and optical image stabilization are must-have features (I'm nuts about shooting low-light photos without using the flash, unless I'm shooting with my Nikon D70 digital-SLR with sophisticated lighting setup that reproduces a natural-light look to the scene).Canon's and Panasonic's and Fujifilm's shoot excellent-quality pictures, too, but only the T100 has the right mix of image quality (and a great movie mode with zoom), standout styling and ease-of-use that make it a total best buy for me.Your comments and questions are welcome."
This item keep your computer from overheating and most of all give you a great support; in my case it has the same size of my laptop so it fits in my notebook backpack.
This product does what it says - handsfree transmission using the radios reasonably intelligent vox system. Unfortunately Garmin chose not to use the headphone plug standardized on by the cellular industry that is the same size. YOU CAN NOT USE THIS HEADSET ON A CELLPHONE, NOR CAN YOU USE A CELLULAR HEADSET ON A GARMIN (even though they fit!). I would normally give a product 5 stars like this - its well built and rugged, but standards are important, and blatantly making your own when one exists is poor design. I have 2 headsets now - one for my phone, and one for my radio - what a pain.
I went shopping recently at a local store that sells computer hardware and the like; and I picked up my third helping of these great CD-Rs by Maxell! Maxell makes a very reliable blank CD-R that can handle up to 80 minutes of music or 700 megabytes of data. Moreover, these blank CD-Rs are capable of recording data at high speeds. I have used these as data discs and discs to record audio. I almost never got a coaster. Great!The CD-R discs are compact and easy to store. While the discs are still blank, store them in the circular case on the spindle that they came in. After your burn data or music onto them, I would recommend storing them in slim jewel cases instead of paper sleeves. It's just better protection for your CD-Rs that have anything stored on them. Don't store these discs, burnt or blank, in rooms that become very hot; this causes damage to any brand of this type of disc and you could lose data over time.There are two caveats that many other people note about any brand of this product: when you are burning the data onto the blank disc, don't be surprised if you see that the data is burning at a rate slower than the packaging advertises. This can happen if your burner doesn't have the capacity to burn faster, or it may be a quirk. I am not a professional so I cannot be certain of precisely what causes this phenomenon; but I assure you that the extra minute or two (tops) that you wait to get your CD-R completed is worth the wait. In addition, DON'T write on these using Sharpie ink pens. The ink can seep through the top coating of the CD-R disc and slowly but surely compromise your data--and you wouldn't want that, now would you? If you need to label the discs, label its jewel case using a post-it note.Overall, Maxell blank CD-R discs store data very reliably and I believe that an extra minute or so to burn the data onto the blank disc is well worth it just in case it doesn't actually burn at the very highest speed advertised.
Top-rated by a variety of magazines, the Sharp LL-T19D1H 19 LCD monitor is the best on the market, for both text and images. It even has a DVI input port, so even though it's designed for primary use as a PC monitor, it can also display the highest-quality videos.The best thing about teh Sharp is its perfect build quality. A lot of other LCD monitors look and feel cheap once you get over the so-called "style" factor. You tap on those monitors and they feel like they'll fall apart. Not the Sharp, which will last a long time.Like I mentioned, you can't find fault with the image quality on this monitor, whether you use it for office apps, gaming, or watching DVDs. Color reproduction is esp. excellent here, and the wide viewing angle (170 h/v) is a plus.My eyes are important to me, and I spent way too much time in front of a computer monitor, that's why I choose the best LCD monitor as my main monitor -- and right now it's this beautiful and high-quality Sharp."
I really don't understand why people blame Amazon or Palm for this cable while the description clearly says it's for certain models, and says it's for models with the universal connector. I wish people would take responsibility for themselves more.Anyway, I got this cable because my office PC runs NT, and it doesn't support USB. The serial cable works perfectly. It doesn't charge your Palm (I have the T2), unlike the USB charge/hotsync cable, and speed is low compared to USB, but it gets the work done.There is, however, one caveat: you cannot transfer MP3 files with the serial cable, because Real Player cannot recognize it. Palm should really move away from Real and opt for something better; Real is all about bloatware and spyware -- I don't know a single soul who likes its intrusive &quot;message center&quot; annoyance.The workaround is you'll need to copy the MP3 files to the SD card directly, into the &quot;\music&quot; folder on the card. If you have a laptop with an SD slot, you'll be fine. But chances are if you are still running NT, your laptop won't have the slot. Also all SD card readers are USB. So in the end, it's probably best to upgrade, or borrow your friend's win2k or XP machine.In short, this cable is cheap and light and seems durable (if you take care in disconnecting the Palm).
Maxell manufactures excellent 60 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 60 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 30 blank minutes for recording on each side. This is useful when recording thirty minute talk shows, for example. The normal bias recording tape and the low noise surface enhance the overall quality of your recording, too.Moreover, the tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many, many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 60 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SANDISK SDCFH512786 512MB Ultra CompactFlash, like most 512MB cards, will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this 512MB card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
If you want a GPS that will tell you where to turn left to get on the Turnpike, this isn't it. But if you want to know exactly where you are on the planet, the Magellan 310 and 315 do an excellent job of it, with full 12-channel satellite tracking, the highest available. The nobs are complicated at first, but most guys like learning that sort of thing. This is basically the perfect gift for geeky dads or hikers.BTW, the screen on the 310 and 315 as well as the features are superior to the eTrex basic model, although that model is far more ergonomic.

HP DeskJet 920C PrinterThe HP920C inkjet printer is designed for the average user at home or office. It comes in a light gray case shaped like other HP printers. It connects to a computer with either an IEEE 1284 parallel cable (DOS or Windows) or a USB cable (Windows 98, Me, 2000, XP). The inkjet cartridge are: #15 for black, #78 for tricolor. HP has long been the leader in inkjet printing. It can also be used with Apple Macintosh computers, see the User's Guide for the Mac.The paper path is the same U-shaped method used in other HP printers. This minimizes desk space and provides a more compact printer than those that use an oblique paper path. You should connect the cable from the printer to the computer before you apply power to the computer or printer. The power supply is built into the printer and not separate like earlier products. It is not good practice to keep the printer powered on when not in use; heat is the enemy of electronics.The User's Guide tells how to set up your printer. Read the warnings about the proper care of inkjet cartridges. Leaving them unused for many months may shorten their useful life. New cartridges have a plastic tape over the nozzles to prevent oxidation of the ink. Do not refill print cartridges, this can void the warranty. The Print Cartridge Status light will blink when a print cartridge is low on ink, improperly installed, or malfunctioning (or wrong cartridge). Open the top cover for details. From the front the five indicators run left to right for: color cartridge problem, black cartridge problem, color ink low, black ink low, print cartridges OK. Both print cartridges must be present to operate the printer. Leave an empty cartridge in place until it is replaced with a new one.The Quick Help document has chapters on learning to print on paper and other media, special features, product maintenance, problem solving, and product specifications. The DeskJet Toolbox provides functions like cleaning print cartridges. Print cartridges and the print cartridge cradle can be cleaned manually using distilled water and a clean cotton swab. There is an accessory to allow Two-Sided Printing on some DeskJet printers. The guide explains inserting it into the printer and choosing this option on the Toolbox screen.
Passionate iPod users know at least one thing about the iPod line-up, and that is they are always changing. The new full-size iPods have moved to an all-color line-up, and that is a good thing. The new 20 GB iPod with U2 branding includes a color display and is 0.06 inches thicker than its 20 GB monochrome-display predecessor. However, after a little use, the small increase in size does not seem significant. Plus, the bonuses are rich.Apple first introduced the U2 iPod in the fall of 2004. At that time it was a 20GB monochrome-display version, and this has become the first update to the U2 iPod.This 20 GB U2 iPod with color display has a battery that lasts three hours longer than the previous 20 GB with monochrome display. That brings the total to approximately 15-hours, which is great as it allows you to use your iPod longer in every day circumstances before charging, while also giving you the power needed to fly almost anywhere in the world, on a single charge. Compare this to some of the earlier iPods that had only eight hours of battery life.What does the color screen add, for you might ask, I'm listening to music, why a color screen?" Well, album art is one benefit. The iPod displays the album art, when playing songs, which helps create the feeling for the album. Furthermore, iTunes works with iPhoto on Mac and Adobe products on PC, in order to transfer your photo libraries to your iPod. You can then view your cherished photo libraries on the go, which might come in handy when you're telling the story of that huge fish no one seems to believe. However, the best part of iPod with color is that you can buy the optional photo adapter, plug it into the dock connector on your iPod, and transfer songs direct from your digital camera via USB. This allows you to move potentially gigabytes of photographs to your iPod, while on vacation, freeing up the memory card in your camera. This is truly a time and money saver! You can return from vacation with thousands of images that would have never fit on your camera's memory card alone. Finally, you can view slideshows of photographs, and even display them on television, with optional A/V cables sold separately.Why has the storage not increased, when switching from monochrome display to color? Apple is obviously choosing to give you the features of a color display plus lower the price of the U2 iPod by $20, rather than increase the size of storage on the base iPod at this time, and it is a good decision! 20 gigabytes is an ample-size iPod, for almost everyone. Of course, if you need more than 20 gigabytes, you will need to choose a non-U2 branded model.Mac or PC? This iPod works beautifully with either a Mac or PC. However, on a Mac, you'll immediately enjoy the synchronization of iTunes, your contacts, iCal calendars, Backup software, and of course iPhoto. On PC, you will have iTunes, but you'll need a third-party application from Adobe to sync photos the right way, while, you can find some shareware on the Internet that will allow you to sync other information, addresses, etc. that you might be interested in trying out.Finally, Podcasting! The newest version of iTunes is 4.9, and it features Podcasting support. Podcasts are internet radio broadcasts, and there are thousands covering nearly every subject imaginable, and more are coming out every day. Podcasts are quickly becoming popular content on iPods around the world. Check them out, and this iPod supports Podcasts out of the box.Appearance - The iPod is beautiful, but the back's chrome finish is prone to scratches, and the screen can become scratched as well. It is a very good idea to protect the back of the iPod and the screen in some way. The back of the U2 ipod includes the engraved autographs of U2 members, so you'll especially want to keep it, from getting scratched. There are many cases and protectors out there, and you will surely find something you like. It is possible the U2 iPod will always hold a slightly higher resale value than the traditional iPod, but the large quantities of U2 iPods made means it will not likely be the hard to find item that previous Apple/Artists partnerships were. The U2 iPod also includes a $50 coupon off a $200 U2 music set sold on iTunes, which will interest U2 fans. However, the U2 iPod is not for only passionate U2 fans. Some choose the U2 ipod, in order to simply have something "a little different," than others.Overall, this is another excellent product from Apple Computer. The design is elegant, simple, and intuitive. It will provide hours of entertainment and convenience. Enjoy your iPod experience."
This product does its job: Which is to protect the Palm. (They can, and do, break, you know, if you drop them without protection).The strap holds the Palm in the case securely, as does the ingenious snap-in docking mechanism. There are slots for two or three credit cards and a side slot for some cash. But this only works as a wallet in a pinch.On the down side, the case does roughly double the depth of the Palm Vx, but the way I see it, that's the price of protection.
Sony's new T-series VAIO ultraportable laptops replace the camera-included TR series, which has been discontinued. There are currently four models in the T-series: T140, T150, T160, and T170. All sport the same casing (no surprise), same weight (3.1 lb. incl. piggy-back battery but excl. AC adapter), same processor (the new Intel ultra-low-voltage Pentium M 733 (based on the Centrino, not Pentium IV, running at 1.1Ghz but with an amazing 2MB level-2 cache!), same screen, and same hard drive (slow-ish 4800rpm 40GB shock resistant drive).The differences among the models are as follows:- The 140 and 160 come with a DVD-ROM/CD-RW drive, so you can't burn DVDs.- The 150 and 170 come with dual-format DVD burner/CD-RW drive, so you can burn both the plus and minus formats of DVDs.- The 140 and 150 come with 512MB of RAM.- The 160 and 170 come with 1GB of RAM (max the T-series can take).- If there's a P" after the model number (e.g., VGN-T150P/L), it means the computer comes with WinXP Professional installed. The absence of "P" means you get WinXP Home.- The "L" after the model number signifies the color scheme. Most of the T's come in what Sony calls "midnight blue," a stylish color that gives an understated emphasis to the exterior. On Sony's website (sonystyle.com) you can special-order a T150P/T that has a burgundy exterior, which looks really "hot."All the T-series VAIOs are designed with two primary goals in mind: ultra portability, reflected mainly in the travel weight; and multimedia capabilities. In fact, VAIO buffs will recall that VAIO stands for Video Audio Integrated Operation, which (I presume) in Japanese means a multimedia-centric computer.All the T models are equipped with an optical drive. Only a year ago, the only ultraportable with a built-in optical drive was the 2.8lb. Panasonic ToughBook W2 (which, as you'll see, is still my favorite ultraportable, for lighter weight and bigger screen). I personally recommend a 150 or 170 with the dual-format (not dual-layer) DVD burner. These days, whether you burn personal videos or backup files, a DVD burner really comes in handy. Of course, if you plan to use the VAIO T as a secondary computer for Starbucks or Barnes & Noble or flying, you can save yourself $150 by skipping the DVD burner. (You still get a CD burner with the 140 and 160.)The VAIO T's are very stylish. Except for the protruding battery which seems like an afterthought, the notebook is well designed and well built. You get both 802.11b+g wi-fi and Bluetooth built-in, as well as an i.Link port and a MemoryStick slot. (Too bad Sony still refuses to support the much more popular Secure Digital format in their laptops.)The T's screen is amazing. Well, it's both amazingly small (only 10.6" vs. the Panasonic W2's 12.1") and amazingly bright, easily viewable outdoors. The widescreen resolution is 1280x768, great for watching DVDs but a pain in the eye for doing your everyday work. (You may want to turn on Windows' built-in font-magnification function, via the Accessibility control panel. Also turn off font smoothing.) I get eye strains from reading e-mails and surfing the Internet. Panasonic W2's 12.1" screen seems so much bigger. Like most ultraportables, the T uses shared memory for video, so don't expect to play Doom 3 on this.The keyboard on the T is shrunk to accommodate the small footprint of the ultraportable. I had the 2.7lb. VAIO N505VE before so I got used to the small keyboard quickly. If you are a touch typist who's never used a 90%-sized keyboard, you might be unhappy with the size, at least in the beginning.Performance is snappy on this laptop despite the many plug-ins it comes with; the new processor with its enormous L2 cache and the generous amount of RAM surely help. When you get the 1GB versions, the performance is simply great for a laptop this size.Sony should be lauded for getting some amazing battery life on this machine, but spanked for making the battery stick out in the T's rear. I watched a 3-hour DVD movie (with wi-fi intentionally left on) as I sat in a B&N; cafe. After the boring movie ended, the T still had plenty of juice left. Just amazing.So, in short, for about two thousand big ones, you get a multimedia road warrior that will turn heads in cafes and on the Amtrak (and might even invite a mugging or two if you are in the wrong neighborhood). The small screen is amazingly bright, and the stick of a battery powers this laptop for good hours. If you want an ultraportable, I still recommend you look at the Panasonic W-2, which is even more stylish (I just love its circular, under-the-keyboard DVD loading), has a bigger screen and weighs less. But if you want an ultraportable with a built-in DVD burner, the T is probably the best you can get right now.(I also like Fujitsu laptops, so you might want to consider the Fujitsu Lifebook P7010 ultraportable as well: cheaper, 80GB hard drive, fingerprint sensor, SD/CF/MemoryStick slot, up to 10.5 hours of battery life!)I hope my quick review helps you. Feel free to e-mail me at hotmail with your questions."
Ok, for writing a 1000th review on a headphones, I'll just say I've tried or owned about every single headphones they're is on the market. Lightweight, closed, earbud, volume control, ones that elimanate outside noise, and ones like these, behind the neck headphones.One thing I have to say is, they are actually pretty comfortable, unlike other types of behind-the-neck headphones. The sound quality on them is pretty good, with banging bass and clear highs and lows. They aren't too expensive, and they are kind of portable.One thing I do have to point out. The cord is kind of short. Though, for portable player listeners, this shouldn't be a problem. Though, you'll feel like a dog on a leash if you use them for a computer were you have to hook them up far away (that is if you don't have a headphone plug on your speakers.)Overall, these are a good buy. I would get these if you like this style and/or using a portable player.
There are alot of phone headsets that are amplified on the receiver (EARPIECE) - this one amplifies BOTH the mic and ear on analog phones. It features a 6 position switch to deal with oddball wiring of the microphone, voltage differences on special key phones, but lacks a comprehensive EVERY phone chart unfortunately. Thinking about it, that's realistically impossible as new phones come and go and this product has been here for 20 years.It does run on 2 AA batteries or an optional adatper for wall power (not another one please!) but realistically even though I am on the phone ALOT I am still on my first set of AA batteries. I change the batteries in my remote control more often! The reason for this is that it has an automatic power down mode when not being used (I recently added a phone recorder to my headset and about 5 seconds after the conversation was over, I could hear background noise go away on the recording when the M22 turned itself off. If you record your calls it's great since VOX works better when the M22 powers down.People I talk to say I am LOUD and CLEAR - more so than with the handset that came with the phone. I did try the passive connection that came with my business phone set for a heatset plug in with the plantronics cord first - using that people prefered the handset over the headset because it was louder. Adding the M22 reversed things.For 90+ % of the phones on the market the factory switch settings will work fine. The other 5 are for oddball wiring configurations. I've used 2 of the other 5 possibilities on a wide variety of telephones over two decades (it wasn't always called the M22 back then but the design looks the same so I'm assuming not much changed)Finally, you don't need a headset nor a business phone. Provided your telephone is not a dial in keypad design where the line voltage runs up the wire to the handset, this will work with home phones too. You can adjust your mouthpiece volume and your eapiece volume separately. As a final touch, the adjusting tool is a sliver of plastic to help with those little rotary knobs and is thoughtfully included with the unit on the under side so you don't need to go get a tiny screwdriver.I deducted 1 star because after 2 decades the price should have gone down on this long standing design (It's more than a key phone for my PBX) - but hapily the quality is still there.
Well, I've owned this for 8 months, and it's still in great shape. I've delete my old review, to write another review on this good CD player.Radio - 5/5 StarsGood reception on most stations, considering I live 15 miles away from metro Tucson (Marana to be exact), so most players would usually black out signally this far, but I can listen to most stations within this distance. The radio sound quality is poor, as on any FM...anything. Though, I don't blame RCA. It's ClearChannel that needs to have their equalizer adjusted. The presets are easy to preset. I put every station in order on the presets from the way their presented from (87.5 - 107.9). Mainly because of the distance of where I live make it hard to get a signal on some stations, making the seek feature skip some stations.Sound/Bass Boost - 4/5 StarsThe bass and treble are NO problem whatsoever. The bass boost is truly effective. The gripe is that the volume, even on the highest setting, is kind of quiet. Anyway, great sound. Just a low peak volume.CD Player - 5/5 StarsThe player has skipped barely, if not at all. All my CDs play fine, even the ones most scratched of all play well. And once again, quiet but great sound.Headphones - 1/5 StarsJust throw them away when you open it.Construction - 5/5 StarsNot even a scratch or malfunction ever since I bought it. Dropped over 5 times and not even a scratch. Even the Sony Walkman has that kind of construction. Actually, I banged this CD player with a hammer and ithad not even a scratch. I award RCA with this kind of durability.Portability - 4/5 StarsThe CD player should fit in most small cases, though even if it's twice as blukier than other CD players (it that where it gets it's durability from?). Good for picky-but-not-to-picky travelers.Cost - 0/0I don't know the cost of it because I got it for a birthday present. If I was RCA, I'd price it $40-$50.Battery Life - 5/5It has an amazing battery life of 36 hours.Overall - 4/5Of all the CD players I've owned (2 Walkmans, 2 junky Memorexes, and 6 other CD players I've tried but not owned), this is the best of the bunch. The headphones suck, but just spend $10-$20 on another pair (volume control type recommended) and you'll be good to go.
If you have the PSP and a little extra cash, it's pretty much mandatory that you get a Memory Stick Duo card. The 32MB that comes in the PSP Value Pack is just a joke -- unless you plan to use the PSP strictly for gaming only, in which case you don't need to buy a larger-capacity memory card.(I suspect Sony includes a small Memory Stick Duo card in the Value Pack to discourage people from copying movies to the PSP. Just my wild guess.)If, however, you want to take full advantage of the PSP multimedia experience, a larger-capacity Memory Stick Duo is just a must. Consider yourself lucky, for just six months ago a 1GB Memory Stick Duo (MSD for short) would have made you $300-$400 poorer. Kudos to Sony for bringing the price down to something we mere mortals can afford. But curses to Sony for not using an industry standard format like Secure Digital.Anyway, you have pretty much two choices when it comes to 1GB MSD cards. Either a Sony, or a Sandisk. Lexar (another company) is supposed to be selling it, too, but I haven't seen theirs in the retail channel, so the choice comes down to either Sony or Sandisk.As I mentioned many times in my previous reviews, I still have lingering doubts about Sandisk's quality control, as in the past I had no less than two Sandisk flash memory cards fail on me when I needed reliability the most (i.e., a Kodak moment" for my digital camera). The price difference between a Sony 1GB MSD adn a Sandisk seems pretty small. BTW, if you see a 1GB MSD for over $150 in a store, you'd be overpaying, so come back to Amazon and get it here.The popularity of the PSP does make both the Sony and the Sandisk 1GB MSD cards hard to find, so maybe you just want to grab whichever one that's in stock. I myself am willing to pay a bit extra for Sony's reliability, but other people have had luck with Sandisk MSD's, so don't let my experience discourage you from getting a Sandisk. It's just that with the Sony memory card, you're unlikely to have any problems, assuming you don't bite or let your dog nibble on the card.1GB is a lot of memory. Most PSP games use 600KB-800KB for game save data. MP3 tunes encoded at the most common 128kbps bit rate runs about 1MB/minute, so a 4-minute song will occupy 4MB. Video files are harder to summarize since there are so many different encoding bitrates and options (e.g., 15fps or 30fps, mono or stereo or surround sound). I encode at 384kbps/15fps/mono, and one hour of video takes about 150MB. If you want to encode at the more fluid 512kbps/30fps/stereo, expect about 300MB per hour. In short, you should have no trouble fitting more than one full-length movies on this. Feel free to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail if you have any questions.Because this MSD card is also "MagicGate-compatible", meaning it supports Sony's digital rights management technology, you can use it in Sony's digital audio players that take Memory Stick Duo or the full-sized Memory Stick. An adapter is included in the package so if you have Sony gear that only takes the original, full-sized Memory Stick (e.g., most Sony miniDV camcorders and digital cameras), you can stick the smaller Memory Stick Duo into the adapter and then insert the adapter into the gizmo."
Almost all of the SPECs on this baby are just what you want in a laptop -- fast processor, just over 1 inch thick case, less than 5 pounds, 5-hour battery. In person, you won't believe how small and truly portable this machine is. It's great for reporters on the go such as myself, or for students in a dorm room. It has all the right ports, and appears to be made with quality in mind.The screen is exceptionally bright as well.My only two complaints: 1) The low-end model skimps horribly on the memory (for shame, Apple! They could have added another 64 MB). You can upgrade the memory easy enough aftermarket, but that's an annoyance (128MB is practically required for OS X, BTW).2) The screen is a fairly miserly 12.1 inches, although it is active-matrix and high-resolution. Now, keep in mind that this contributes to the low-cost, svelte form factor and long battery life, but I wouldn't mine having a 13-14 inch screen when I'm squinting at text all day. I generally solve this problem by upping the size of the fonts, but still, this screen is rather small. If you buy one of the higher-end models, say the one with the DVD drive, you may find that watching a DVD on this small screen is not exactly the cinematic dream that you find on the amazing Titanium Powerbook G4 (with its glorious ultrawide 15.3 screen.)Enjoy!"
How many pictures will it store? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about. Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The Lexar Media 128MB Memory Stick, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera, 64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera. These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
The product is just what I wanted. As the iPAQ only comes with one I knew it would not be long before I needed an new one and sure enough....The product perfectly fits my pda, i like it!
The Dimage F-series of digital cameras are nothing short of AMAZING. Or AWESOME. Or PERFECT. Each model is a perfect balance between size (compact, take-anywhere) and features (especially the number of manual controls which simply don't exist on other digital cameras, even excellent offerings from Canon or Fuji). 3X optical zoom is pretty standard on prosumer cameras these days; of course it would be nice to have 10X or 30X or 100X optical zoom, but at what price? The F100 (and other F models) are very well priced, being affordable to every level of digital camera enthusiasts.Unlike the flat dimensions of the Dimage X-series, the F-series models are a bit elongated and hence *easier* to hold (especially if you are rightie, of course). The controls are pretty straightforward, although you might want to keep the manual handy the first couple days you use the camera. Rechargable batteries are dirt cheap these days with the Chinese entering the market, and NiMH ones have twice the recharge cyles as LiIon ones, so power is not a problem -- you just should bring enough for your trip.I also love the fact Minolta uses SD memory cards. My Fujitsu laptop (as well as other multimedia laptops from Toshiba and HP) have a built-in SD/MMC slot, so I can just stick in the SD card and it instantly sits on my XP desktop as a removable drive. Then it's just easy drag-n-drop in Windows Explorer! Just perfect!What can I say. If you don't have an F100 (4 megapixel) or F300 (5.3 megapixel) already, go get one today!

Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available. A 1000MB card should be an investment. You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity. Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted. Then what do you do? Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.
The e335 is actually designed and manufactured by a Taiwan-based OEM, not Toshiba itself, but it still exhibits pretty good quality. At this great price, this is a solid PPC to own.
Sony's D-NF610 slim CD &quot;walkman&quot; is an excellent personal audio companion. It's similar to its sibling D-NF510, except the NF610 has a digital tuner that pulls in AM/FM/TV and special weather channels, all in a compact, stylish form factor. Assembled in Malaysia (a country known for its anti-American politics -- hence one star deducted from my rating), the player seems pretty reliable. The weird shape is not as cool as Sony's perfectly round models, but it does allow for a larger, 2-line LCD display which, yeah!, can show MP3 tags. Another impressive feature is the 75-hour playback on two regular AA batteries.Sound quality is good if nothing to get overly excited about. As always, you may want to replace the included headphones with your own favorite. On a good pair of earphones, the &quot;digital mega bass&quot; boost adds a pleasant and clear boom to the music, so you know this is not a phony, irritating bass system typically found on the Coby's and Samsung's.The player also plays CD-R/RW discs burned with MP3 files or Sony's proprietary ATRAC3 files. Sony makes all kinds of claims regarding ATRAC3, but since 95% of the world uses MP3 and another 3% uses WMA and the rest probably AAC, I see little reason to burn ATRAC3 discs.Finally, the price is right for a high-quality portable CD player.

Maxell manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape, as one reviewer correctly notes, make it good for recording lectures and music using standard, less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.If you pay the Amazon price of $6.75 for the fifteen-pack you spend roughly 45 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the Maxell XL-II; but it's still not the same as a digitized CD-R recording. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.

Iomega 100MB External Parallel Zip Drive ZIP100P2This is the latest version of the device that has been in use since the mid-1990s. It allows both storage and transfer and works on any bi-directional or EPP parallel port. For best results, you should run the Parallel Port Accelerator" program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like with a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device. Most printers will operate from the printer port on the back [except maybe those made in the late 1990s]. I had a problem with one used drive; an inkjet printer did not print as well when attached to this unit.Remove the disk before turning a computer off. You should never insert a ZIP disk in the drive when the computer is off as this can cause damage. Normally, shutting down the computer causes the disk to eject. If you lose power, you must disconnect power to the computer, open its cover, and push a straightened paper clip into the Emergency Eject Hole.The "User's Manual" warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega "Copy Machine" program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega "Format" function. Use "Short Format" to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The "Long Format" repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. "Write Protection" protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as "non-removable" so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn't work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first ("daisy chaining"). This changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CD-roms. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). Both units have been proven useful over time. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as it works for you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different Windows systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: "SCSI controllers", "Iomega", "Iomega Parallel Port Interface", then "Finish".You should set the Printer Port as EPP or ECP.Then modify the 'Settings' for the Iomega Parallel Port Interface as follows.The port settings assumes the usual I/O address.'My Computer'; 'Properties'; 'System Devices'; 'Device Manager';'SCSI Controllers'; 'Iomega Parallel Port Interface'; 'Properties'; 'Settings'/mode:eppecr /port:378 /speed:6"

I bought it form Eforcity and it works exactly the same as the Epson brand. I counted the pages and I got approximately the same number of pages. No clogups in fact, I believe I cleaned the heads less than I had to with the genuine replacement cartridge.
This works great with my Sony Cybershot or may say it's even better than my original battery charger set. The battery holds longer charge then before. Till now, I have no problem with it. Good one!

First off, let me point out that John A. Wincek in an earlier review gave a misleading account of dpreview.com's review of the Coolpix 4800. Yes, the 4800's noise level at ISO 400 was higher than the Canon camera dpreview used for comparison, but not to the level of total trash as Wincek seemed to be implying. And dpreview points out that the 4800 uses less noise reduction than the competition (all digital cameras employ some kind of in-camera noise reduction algorithm to filter out" noise.)Ok, what really surpised me about the 4800 was how big it was. I mean, it still qualifies as a small point-and-shoot, but given how it looks like the Coolpix 3200 and 4200, I thought it was going to be sub-compact, but I was wrong. It's big enough that it won't fit in a pocket. The lens compartment protrudes. Together with the grip, the camera is quite deep at over 2 inches. This does give a good grip and you can use it in one hand -- it weighs about 11 oz. with the LiIon battery.The 8.3x optical zoom is awesome. Its 35mm equivalent is 36-300. Because the 4800 doesn't have an image stabilizer -- a controversial feature among photo enthusiasts -- you MUST use a tripod or place the camera on a steady surface if you are to use the tele end of the zoom. At anything over 6x zoom, your handshakes will magnify many times and result in blurry photos, no matter how well lit the scene is. One problem with the 4800 is when you are beyond 6-7x zoom, focus feels slow and keeps flipping, which is very frustrating.The all-plastic camera feels solid but the decision to use proprietary LiIon rather than AA disappointed me, as I have a good collection of AA NiMH batteries and older Coolpix models used such batteries. Battery life is respectable; I got over 100 shots mostly with flash and I zoomed in and out a lot. (I hate to say this, but "Camera buff" was probably lying about recharging every six pictures, unless he/she got a defective unit or didn't know what he/she was doing.)The upshot is, if you want a power zoom in a small package, the 4800 is worth a look. On the other hand, its relative bulky size, so-so picture quality and the lack of a optical viewfinder (an electronic one doesn't cut it for me) make it less attractive to someone seeking a sleek, compact point-and-shoot. Its lack of controls over picture-taking makes it unsuitable for serious photographers."
Compared to the older Optio S, the S4 features 4 megapixels (vs. Optio S's 3MP), and weighs in at only 3.5 ounces vs. Optio S's 4.1. In short, the S4 is another truly AMAZING digital camera that's no bigger than the Apple iPod. If there's one consumer-grade digital camera you get this holiday season, the S4 should be the one. (If money is object, choose the S model.)
Because it's more than just a grip.First off, it needs 4x C cells to run. It doesn't just supplement your flash with the 6V it gets from the C cells, but it also uses them to boost the charging circuit so your flash can fire faster (for sporting events, spread exposure photography, etc). How it does this is by a clever system Olympus designed into their FL-50 and FC-05 flash controllers. They have a 4 pin interface in the front that takes in 2 voltages, a precision 6.0 V reference for running the modeling lights in the twin flash and ring flash, and running the logic in the flash itself. The other 2 pins take in 330 VDC to help" charge the main capacitor that fires the flash.So when you mount this grip on your E series (or other compatible camera) it supplements the flash's internal charging circuit with a big beefy C-cell driven circuit. When I say supplement, I mean the AA based charger built into the flash works in tandem with this unit. It is partway to a SHV-01 separate high voltage pack system and in fact can do a 3 way supplement where the FP-01, SHV-01, and internal charger all work together to give you full power flashes in under a second charge time from a simple but well designed flash system. (the FP-01 has an input set of pins to hook up your SHV-01 pack if you own that also).Note that the grip strap on the side is an OPTION - it is shown in the photo but not part of the FP-01 - you must buy it separately as the GS-1 grip strap. The strap also works between almost any 5 or 6 " separated strap hooks, such as when an E300 has a BLM-3 mounted under it, and other cameras Olympus makes.Now the negatives. Olympus designed the FL-50 and FP-01 and SHV-01 to work with many cameras, which is great, but you need different connecting cables depending on the model you you have. If you want to use the shutter button located on the FP-1 you'll need a short jumper cable to tie it to the camera because there is no direct tie.And, for full TTL control, you will need a 5 pin tie cable - it will likely slide into the hotshoe if your camera lacks the 5 pin flash connector used for TTL control to hook to the FP-1 - if your camera doesn't have a hot shoe, but has the 5 pin jack, they use a different cable to connect it to the fp-1.Basically - you need 2 cables to fully enable the FP-1 and your camera - consult the olympus guides to determine which two are used with your camera - they are $25-$45 each in addition to the FP-1.It does add price to your flash , but it also makes the camera and flash balance better, gives you 700+ FULL flash exposures on a set of batteries and something Olympus does not tell you, it works great off the 6000 mAh NiMh C cells that are out there (it's meant for alkaline, but runs on NiMH better, in fact charging faster off the NiMH than the alkalines)I do *NOT* recommend the AA NiMH to C adapters with this product - it needs the very low internal impedance of the C size cell to operate right. Substituting AA cells for C cells will degrade the FP-1's ability to help your flash charge faster. A set of 4 6000 mAh NiMH C cells costs about $20 from a battery supplier and can be recharged to full capacity before you leave for a photo shoot. You'll be set for a minimum of 700 flashes, probably 1000 - and if you forget your AA batteries or find they are dead, the flash will work entirely off the FP-1 supply.Olympus cautions the FP-1 is not intended for large lenses such as the 50-200 mm zoom. I tried mine and found it was very unbalanced. Those lenses have their own tripod mount at the center of gravity because of their weight (7 lbs+) which is hard to counter the torque using the FP-1 handle. A better configuration for fast flash charging with the 50-200 zoom would be the SHV-01 power supply with a FL-50 flash on the hot shoe of the camera. A long coiled cable connects the SHV-01 on your belt to the flash without impeding your movement with the camera.I have a cheap ($10) metal bracket to add 2 hot shoes to my video camera for diversity receivers on wireless microphones. The FP-1 grip is far better built than my microphone bracket, which only holds a couple ounces of weight. The FP-1 has a much better feel and you will enjoy the faster cycle time that comes with it on your camera. Just don't forget the GS-1 and 2 cables are specific to your model."
When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.Storage - This is the new 1 GB version of the iPod Nano. Apple released the 1 GB version, to have an entry-level nano priced at only $150. You get all the features of the 2 & 4 GB models, but simply less storage for songs. If having less songs to carry around is ok with you, save some money with this player.Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.Color - The white nano is my favorite, for its the traditional iPod color. The black nano looks beautiful too, but scratches show more easily.Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.
I bought the SHV-01 and a spare battery (7.2 V, 2.4 AH) pack with meter before leaving for a 14 day cruise. I left behind the charger trying to pack light and had no regrets. This system is able to deliver over 2000 flashes.The SHV-01 outputs one long flexible cable with 2 voltages, a 6.0 VDC and 330 VDC line. These operate the selected flash head. The 6.0 VDC is used to run focusing lights and modeling lights. The 330 VDC charges the flashes capacitor.The concept behind the SHV-01 is that you are carrying energy in a larger package than can be physically fit inside the flash, and deploying it through a connecting cable. The result is a larger number of flashes and a MUCH faster recharge time between flashes. If you are shooting indoor sports or other motion activites where you must do rapid fire flash photography the SHV-01 is a great tool. If you don't mind 8 second recycle times, then you don't need the SHV-01. Because of the forethought in that theOlympus FC-01 Macro Flash Controller (for use with TF-22 & RF-11 Flash Heads)andOlympus FL-50 Electronic Flash for Olympus C7070, E1, E300 & E500 Digital SLR Camerasare designed on the same body, the SHV-01 can be used with both of them. Additionally, you can forget the AA batteries with the SHV-01 as it carries a 7.2 V, 2.4 AH pack to draw power from. If you do use AA batteries, then they supplement the cycle times and number of shots.The SHV-01 is the most powerful option to power flashes olympus makes. In most cases it can ready your flash in under 1 second (vs about 8 seconds normally with a good set of NiMH charged cells). The FP-01 uses C-cells in the grip to do the same thing as the SHV-01 with about 1/2 the effectiveness due to the lower supply voltage and smaller design (in the grip). The SHV-01 w/ an extra battery will do 2000 shots with no problem and no recharging.
After recent week stay at the Affinia Hotels, I can definitely say i will be coming back. They offer so many in room amenities and services, Just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be. My most enjoyable experience at the Affinia Hotel was the amazing customization they offered, I would recommend Affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay .
Although much too overpriced in my opinion, the hotel is spotless. The staff was very courteous. And the spa service ? Was a God send ! In a relatively flexible location for traveling for sight seeing so I didnt spend major bucks trying to get around the city ! LOVE IT ! Going back for my anniversary
The Affinia hotel in Chicago was superb. the room service was exemplary and the food, I don't even know were to start. The chef obviously knew what he was doing, I especially loved the seafood, my personal favorite was the shrimp. Aside from this, I loved how beautiful the hotel was. It is definetly a bargain for the price, for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but, I felt as if i was in a $10,000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe. great bang for your buck. Would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city. My friends actually went their a while back because of me. They loved it! I know you will too.
THIS HOTEL IS FANTASTIC. I stayed there on my way through Chicago towards Arizona, and could not believe the great quality of the hotel. I'd have thought I was in a Vegas suite. Really polite staff, great housekeeping, and amazing prices. On my way out, I was telling the manager about how much I'd loved the hotel, and he even offered me an extra night there! You can safely say that my trip was delayed roughly 24 hours.
The Affinia Chicago is a wonderful place to stay, my husband and I stayed there for a week to visit some family and had an amazing time. The rooms were very well organized and comfortable, the staff there are very friendly, and the food there is more then amazing. we are defiantly going back next year.
The magnificent mile in Chicago is a great place to visit, and staying at the Affinia Chicago just made it that much better! The location is awesome - all of the great shopping spots were just moments away, and getting to Navy Pier was a cinch! And the accommodations themselves were wonderful! The hotel lets you completely customize your stay, all the way down to choosing your own pillow! Very impressed overall!
My stay at the Affinia last weekend was ideal and I can't wait to return. I was in town for a brief personal trip and wanted to have a clean, lovely room near the shopping downtown. Affinia fit the bill. The location was perfect, just one block from the magnificent mile. The decor was modern and sleek, and my room was impeccably clean. They even have a pillow menu! The price was pretty reasonable, too. I'll definitely be back.
We recently completed our first visit to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the Affinia Chicago hotel where we stayed. The hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests, including individual pillow choices, complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit,and fine dining in two on-site restaurants, one of them roof-top with amazing city views. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.
We stayed for two nights for a meeting. It is an upscale chain hotel and was very clean. The service was very good, as the hotel front desk employees were kind and knowledgeable. The rooms are decent sized and have soft mattresses. The restaurant has good seafood, but was a bit expensive. We would come back again. 
I just came back from this awesome, terrific hotel last week, and I have to say-- I loved it! My wife and I were there for a week due to a business meeting, and right when I stepped into the hotel, I knew that this business vacation will be well spent. The customer service was very great, and an employee even guided us toward our room! We were introduced to a fantastically lit room with 2 beds, a flat screen TV, and even free internet access. My wife loved it, and kept on using the free shampoo and body bath soap. When I headed down to the lobby for my conference, I got lost, and asked one of the people who worked there where my meeting might be held. He leaded me to the door, and I was very impressed. There is a fitness center which I went everyday, and this great restaurant called C-House situated nicely next to the hotel lobby, where I had a nice steak and my wife a salad. All in all, I thought that the trip was really worth it, and my stay was very welcoming at the Affinia Chicago. I highly recommend that whenever you visit Chicago you should stay there, you will not regret it. 
I first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the Affinia Chicago hotel where I'm greeted by name by the concierge. He tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when I booked the stay. He shows me to my room (paying careful attention to my bags, and ensuring that I needn't lift a finger) sure enough, the down pillow I had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain, which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they didn't literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed. I notice that there's a display of champagne and cupcakes (!) atop the dresser and my "experience kit" which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks, and a yoga mat. namaste. Unable to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom, I find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower, but a jacuzzi, lined with candles of vanilla, deep enough to bathe a walrus. Feeling girlish, I run the water and test before going to dinner. The Hotel's restraunt C-house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think you're dining with the kings of paradise. or at least eating in the Caribbean itself. hmm, I should have brought a date.
The Affinia Manhattan is fantastic! My husband and I stayed there when we went to visit my sister. I loved the room. It was one of the best hotel beds we have ever slept in. The view was incredible. Manhattan is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. The staff was very helpful as well. They had no problem going out of their way to be helpful. I would suggest this hotel to anybody!
We just got back from a trip to Chicago for my 30th birthday and we could not have been more impressed by this hotel! Service was excellent, especially the maid service. Our room was so clean and fresh towels brought in daily. The front desk staff was some of the most professional and friendly staff I have ever dealt with while travling. The location is excellent as it is within walking distance of the best restaurants and stores. I highly recommend Affinia for a the perfect family vacation.
I was in town to visit my cousin an stayed for three nights at this wonderful hotel. Its so close to the shopping i wanted to do with my cousin , granted i had a personal guide a.k.a. my cousin Janice. The amenities were unbelieveable an the service was great with the upmost hospitality. Would recomend to everyone great for kids an adults. The room and view were spectacular, the beds were very comfy and the room was emaculate.
We had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the Affinia Chicago Hotel. We found it conveniently located on E. Superior Street, near many local attractions. The rooms were modern chic with a very urban feel. The pillow menu was awesome, my partner and I have such different preferences, the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home. The hotel room layout was comfortable and spacious with all the right touches to make our stay perfect! I couldn't believe the amenities available to guests. My Beagle, Betsy enjoyed her stay at the "Jet Set Pet" care center. She was pampered as much as I was. It was such a comfort knowing we could bring her along and that we could enjoy our stay without the stress and concern that comes along with traveling and pet ownership! Another feature I personally enjoyed was the Walking Tour Kit. It included an iPod Shuffle pre-loaded with a workout playlist, a deck of cards; guidebook that included walking tours, and comfort items like a towel and map! I felt like I was the most important guest (surely, everyone felt that way as they checked in to their rooms). Highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an Affinia Hotel!!
My husband and I arrived for a 3 night stay for our 10th wedding anniversary. We had booked an Executive Guest room, upon arrival we were informed that they would be upgrading us to a beautiful Junior Suite. This was just a wonderful unexpected plus to our beautifully planned weekend. The front desk manager was professional and made us feel warmly welcomed. The Chicago Affinia was just a gorgeous hotel, friendly staff, lovely food and great atmosphere. Not the mention the feather pillows and bedding that was just fantastic. Also we were allowed to bring out beloved Shi-Tzu and he experienced the Jet Set Pets stay. The grooming was perfect, the daycare service we felt completely comfortable with. This was a beautiful weekend, thank you Affinia Hotels! We would visit this hotel again! 
The Affinia Hotel is beautiful! It's in a great location, the service is top-notch, and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. The look of the hotel is very modern, but it feels warm and cozy, too. The restaurant is amazing! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back! If you're planning a trip to Chicago, check this place out!
There were many positives when staying in this hotel at the north end of the Magnificant Mile. The rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed with great attention to detail. The quality of service was excellent, the staff professional, and the location was perfect. There are great views of Chicago from many of the rooms. The staff seemed to care about the quality of my stay from the moment I was greeted upon arrival to the moment I got in my taxi to leave. There is a nice rooftop bar/restaurant perfect for a lite meal or a refreshing cocktail with great views of the city. There really weren't any negatives and I would recommend this boutique hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago area.
Friendly staff, clean building and rooms. The hotel was located nearby everything we were interested in seeing. Staff was willing to help give directions and very knowledgable of city. Rooms were beautifully designed and well lit, spacious and comfortable. 
I took my family to the Affinia Chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous. My kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by. My wife was really stoked with Spaffina. The pampering and really made her feel special. And they are very attentive to pets also. My dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention.The hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels, so their Stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also. My favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content, which left me free to go over to Underground Wonderbar for a nice cocktail.
Hotel Allegro Chicago is a beautiful place. I was originally dreading being in Chicago due to the fact it was all business and no play, but as soon as I saw the inside of the hotel I was stunned! I wasn't expecting to stay at a place that made business trip feel like a get-away vacation. The service there was amazing, everybody was very friendly. When I saw my room, once again my jaw almost dropped. The room was fit for a king, the designs on the wall were so elegant. The beds were extraordinarily comfy. I think for my next business trip I am going to bring my wife and kids with me. I give this Kimpton Hotel 5/5 stars!
When I had to visit Chicago for business I asked some of my associates where to stay and several of them recommended the Hotel Allegro. After my stay I can honestly say that I agree. From the luxurious bedding to the technological amenities, everything was thought of. The only place I find more comfortable then this hotel is my actual home. I now know where I will be staying every time I have business in this city, and anyone I know who is doing the same will hear so.
My wife and I stayed at the allegro this weekend while I was on a business trip. I was very impressed with their hospitality and my wife very much(maybe too much) enjoyed the in-house spa. Rooms service was a bit slow but, overall great hotel would stay again. 
During a recent business trip to Chicago I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Allegro. The lobby gave a good first impression. It was a very clean with a modern designer's feel and the customer service was great. I proceeded to the counter to check-in and within 5 minutes I had the key to my room. I was told to check out the infamous 312 restaurant but I was tired from my flight. I checked into my room. The room was great. A king size bed 37" flat screen tv and standard desk all designer furniture. After I unpacked I had to check my email. Hooking up to their Wi-Fi was quick and painless! I had a good night sleep and early wake up the next day for my business meeting. I decided to try the restaurant for breakfast. I had an omelet and fruit. The restaurant was great and the food was perfect. I only wish I had more time to stay and enjoy lunch; nevertheless duty called. The concierge had my taxi waiting for me right after breakfast and I was off to work. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. It's one of the best I've ever stayed at after multiple business trips.
My fiancee and I were looking for a modern, upscale venue for our wedding reception. We have found the perfect location at The James. From the ballroom to the personal attention to detail, each step was handled with care. Now that we have locked in our date, we are more excited than ever. Thank you staff at The James for making our day even more special!
My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Chicago this summer. During this time we stayed that the Hotel Allegro. I knew this would be a positive experience from day one when I actually booked our reservations, the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous, and the whole process was quick, easy, and painless. Upon actually checking in the day of our honeymoon, the customer service was there again the staff again made us feel at home and at ease. The rooms were beautiful and the spa service is excellent. Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up. 
The Hotel Allegro in Chicago is understated luxury. I love the minimalist decor, and the linens were quality and exquisite. You can't beat the location, either, it's located in the heart of the theatre district. Walking distance to all the great restaurants in Chicago! They also offer an in-room spa service, which is pure decadence. I chose to indulge in the Eucalyptus Mani/pedi. It was by far the priciest manicure and pedicure I have had in my life (135 dollars) but it was a wonderful experience. The eucalyptus treatments left my hands and feet feeling so soft yet refreshed at the same time. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to experience the finer thingsthis gorgeous city has to offer.
Extravagant, Exuberant Experience! Our stay at Hotel Allegro was very enjoyable. The intoxicating views made the get-away much more relaxing, as well as the exceptional room service. The rooms were very decorative and well above par. I very much enjoyed the complimentary tea. I Would highly recommend Hotel Allegro as a must stay vacation get-away.
My stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience! The staff were helpful and considerate, always there to tend to my needs. My suite was extremely clean, and had all the amenities that I could ask for. I almost didn't want to leave my room, because it was so nice. But in the end I did, because the hotel is situated in such a great area, that I had to go out and see some of the sites. This hotel has wonderful rooms and service, and is in a really great area. I suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago.
This was my first time in Chicago and I tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks. I took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter. I made my way up to my room, which was spectacularly bright and well-lit, then I ordered some food. All in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic. If I didn't have such a short stay in Chicago I would have stayed in my hotel room all day!
 If you are traveling to Chicago and need a place to stay, I highly recommend the Hotel Allegro Chicago. It was visiting time visiting Chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the Hotel Allegro. He said they were pet friendly,which was a huge plus. This is because I hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time I travel for business. Upon my arrival, I was met with friendly valet who treated me like I was the only customer who mattered. I walked in and saw a hotel like no other I have seen before or after. The lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place I could relax in. After I had entered and checked in, I saw the staircase, which looked like a testament to the staircase in the "Titanic". Frankly, I was amazed and I had not even entered my room yet. My room was a Queen Deluxe room and it was amazing. The bed had a blue headboard,which I have never seen before, and the colors worked together so well I seriously contemplated living there. The room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food I ordered. Later I wanted to get a drink and I enjoyed it at The Bar 312, which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel. These are the specifics of my stay, but there is much more to be experienced that I did not mention if you visit the Hotel Allegro. In summary, they allow pets, the service is amazing, the decoration superb, and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments. What more could a person ask for?
I went here with the family, including our dog Marley(They are very pet friendly). We really enjoyed it. This place is huge with over 480 rooms and suites and is in the center of downtown close to shopping and entertainment. It also seems that it would be a great place to have a wedding or to host an event. I will definately be coming back next time I need to come to chicago definately a fine four star hotel!
For Top Class Treatment Choose Hotel Allegro. In all of my years of buisness travel and vacationing, I have never been more happy with the service at a hotel than I was at Hotel Allegro. I searched many hotel websites looking for the perfect hotel to spend our honeymoon, and Hotel Allegro seemed like the right choice. Soon as I walked into to their elaborate lobby area, it was like I was a big shot on Wallstreet, the service was excellent and the best part, they allow animals. They treated my little dog Johnny like he was royalty. They have everything you could ever need in a hotel, from in room spa service to a workout center. They even made sure that I had all of my drinks and amentites ready for the Monday night Bears game. If I were to give have to rate it from a 1 - 10. Id have to give it a 10 many times over. I highly recommend Hotel Allegro in Chicago Illinois and I will be back again.
Having come to Chicago with my three sisters for a relaxing weekend of shopping and spa days, the Hotel Allegro Chicago filled every bit of my checklist. We arrived and immediately were checked in and shown to our rooms; we both had the "double double deluxe". The rooms were gorgeous, well taken care of, clean, comfortable, well decorated and luxurious. The hotel also has a spa which was perfect because we didn't even have to leave the hotel for our relaxing spa day. The hotel has great staff, they were always attentive to our needs. My favorite part was the complimentary tea and cofee - I am a coffee addict and getting my caffeine fix any time of every day was great! Stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago if you want great service from a relaxing and luxurious hotel in the heart of Chicago's hustle and bustle!
A few nights ago, I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in the Theater District of Chicago. I'd heard some amazing things about the great food, and how friendly the staff were. Upon arrival, the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic! They treated me as if I stayed there all the time! The rooms were cozy, with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag. I ordered breakfast the next morning, and had room service bring it up. The meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering, and was delicious! I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling, or any families staying in Chicago, as the rooms were very reasonably priced, and is a short distance to lots of great sites. Next time I come through Chicago, I will definitely be staying here! 
I have to admit, I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia, but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago, my fears were slightly assuaged. A few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before, and had nothing but positive things to say. With this new-found optimism in mind, I went forward on my journey in confidence. I have to say, I was not let down. From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I felt at home. The concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms, and the check-in process was fast and efficient. The rooms themselves are incredibly homey, feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire's mansion. The high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels, really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago, and provided a secure place to stay at night, or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group. Of course, the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel. I found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building. Overall it's very cozy, and has a certain old-world feeling to it, once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times. It was never overwhelmingly crowded, and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly, yet not intrusive. I don't usually enjoy staying in hotels, but I love the Allegro Chicago!
My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it. The atmosphere was very chic & upscale; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank. My wife even got to bring along her dog (aka #1 man!). I would definitely stay here again & would recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area.
My friends and I were in Chicago last month and were looking for a resonably priced hotel in a decent neighborhood. Well we came across the Hotel Allegro and immediately fell in love! Everything from the colors, the staff, the architecture, and the pricing were AMAZING! We couldn't have found a better hotel. The service was impeccable..talk about a 5 star hotel for someone with a 2 star budget! My friends and I plan on staying here next year when we return.. I can't wait until then! 
My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary this past weekend. The hotel is the perfect combination of sophistication and glamour from the moment you arrive. The concierge staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our weekend stay, and the hotel itself provided many interesting and fun things to do. We were very impressed with the overall setup of the hotel; the lobby, dining areas, and rooms all had a special touch of class that made our weekend exciting and full of luxury. The decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white, and lighting that complimented and set the mood. The bar and lounge areas had excellent service, and the views from our room perfectly captured the excitement of downtown Chicago. Additionally, my husband and I were extra pleased to learn that because we are AAA members, we would be receiving 20% off our room rate for the weekend. Overall, the amenities and experience of staying at the Hotel Allegro Chicago made us feel like movie stars, pampered and taken care of all weekend in a classy establishment, one in which we would definitely choose to stay again.
I recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to attend a corporate meeting. To say the rooms at this beautifully renovated hotel are stylish is an understatement. I stayed in one of the more moderately priced rooms yet found all the amenities of premium rooms at other hotels. My room was spacious and furnished in a retro-modern style. A fully stocked refreshment center, wet bar, and LCD HD TV were amongst the standard items. The Allegro is in the center of everything, the Chicago Loop of the financial district, the Chicago Theatre district, great shopping on Slate Street and fine dinning is available adjacent to the hotel (I suggest the 312 Lunch Club). The fitness room is well equipped and clean. The professional and friendly service was the icing on the cake during my stay at the Allegro. My next visit to the Chicago area will definitely include a stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago. 
The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is a wonderful hotel. I had the opportunity to stay there on business and wished I could have stayed for longer. The staff is so nice and helpful. They really treat you like a VIP and are there to help with any questions you might have. The rooms are so beautifully decorated that you wish you could hire their designer to do your home. In my room I had access to my own personal dvd and cd collection. Did I say IN the room? I didn't even have to leave or order something on the television. It was nice to shower with their AVEDA products and get into my microfiber robe and slippers that they supplied me. While staying in for the night I was also able to use my laptop in my room since they have wifi throughout the hotel.The bed was very comfortable and everything was so clean! In the morning I was treated to a great complimentary breakfast and ordered a massage. Yes...ordered. They came to my room and I didn't even have to leave. Very comfy! This hotel was by far the best that I have stayed in and I travel a lot for business so I would know.You always have high expectations when you're staying at hotels and I'm pleased to say that my expectations were far exceeded. I'm recommending this hotel to everyone I know that will be staying in the Chicago area. I will definitely be back and make reservations for a longer stay this time because I just didn't want to leave! I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars.
My friend and I visited Amalfi Hotel last week when we were in Chicago and found it to be a great place, very sophisticated and luxurious, with lots of attention to detail in the decor and wonderful customer service. The beds were comfortable. The room service was great as was the gym... I fully enjoyed the views from the hotel room... so beautiful at night... the city scape. And in the morning, the free continental breakfast was delicious. It was a wonderful experience being at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago. I am eager to visit there again. 
If you have the money, Amalfi Hotel is the place for you. All the way from it's 316 thread count, Egyptian linens to the 24 hour fitness center. This hotel has anything you would need or want. The rooms are equipped with free wi-fi, 32in plasma televisions, multi-head showers and much, much more. You can do anything from fine dining and wine to working on the computers in the business center, which is equipped with computers free to your use. After a long night at the bar, you can get a complimentary breakfast at each floor. Over all the service is great as well. I recommend this hotel to any one from business professionals to young singles looking for a good time. I plan on coming back very soon.
Amalifa Hotel in Chicago was an extremely pleasant and exciting hotel experience. I was taken away by the design and decor of the building and the exceptional customer service. I will definitely be returning for another stay!
I was visiting Chicago for a christening with my fiance. I was impressed with this hotel from the moment I checked in. The lobby was exceptionally modern with color and furnishings. Front desk staff was pleasant and helpful, especially Susan, who quickly suggested and reserved a table for us at Keefer's Steakhouse for a late dinner. The room itself was fabulous. Extremely comfortable King sized bed, dual head shower, breathtakingly beautiful views of the city, I couldn't ask for more. After a great nights sleep we awoke to a great FREE breakfast right outside our room! Next we enjoyed a couple's massage and I was treated to a facial as my fiance took a short run through the city. After a day full of shopping we retired to our room and ordered room service that was on time and delicious. Unfortunately we checked out the next day, because I could have stayed there forever. I fully recommend the Amalfi Hotel Chicago for everyone interested in a superior stay. It is truly a beautiful and well appointed hotel.
Amalfi Hotel Chicago is just minutes from Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, the Chicago Opera Theater, The House of Blues, and the hottest night clubs. At $200.00 per night, you can expect the very best from your staff, and your accomodations. When I arrived for my weekend stay, I was greeted by a pleasant surprise of wall art, and eclectic style. After reaching my room, I was able to relax in peace on the numerous pillows. I didn't choose to use the spa this trip, but when I come back, it will be the first item on my list! The business office was great, because I had a last minute emergency with work- thank goodness for cocktail hour. Breakfast was delicious. I have already told a friend from Naperville that the next time I'm in town, she'll have to stay at Amalfi with me, instead of commuting. She really missed out! -Atlanta Girl-
The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was by far one of the best experiences I've had. It definitely felt as comfortable as home with the all the luxuriance of a five star establishment. I had forgotten my favorite CD that puts me to sleep each night. When mentioning this in front of the Front desk clerk, she told me that they have a huge collection of CD's available for guests. Low and behold, they had my favorite CD!! Also, my laptop was not cooperating. Come to find out, they offer every guest full access to their amazing and fully functional business center! From now on, when visiting Chicago, I will ONLY be staying at the Amalfi Hotel!
My husband and I stay at the Amalfi every year for our anniversary. We just love it! The service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly. The hotel has very good cuisine options, which are all very tasty! The hotel is in close proximity to downtown and all the fun things going on there. The rooms are very comfortable and quiet. Perfect for relaxing! Will definitely keep coming back!
This has been one of the most pleasurable hotels Ive ever stayed at. From the beautiful concourse to the amazing food, Amalfi really exceeds its standards. The in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible. I highly recommend this hotel as I will give my stay a 5/5 stars.
Great location in Chicago downtown. The staff is professional and warm. The room is spacious and clean. Nice complimentartry breakfast. I will definitely stay here again next time in Chicago.
Last weekend my wife and i decided to take a weekend trip to Chicago. When looking for a hotel we weren't all that interested in price, but more of a relaxing getaway in the heart of downtown. I did some research and and came across the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. What sparked my interest was it's location and the fact that they offer in room spa treatments. Located in Chicago's river north area, it is close to the magnificent mile so we can get all of our shopping done while staying relatively close to the hotel and also do some sightseeing along the chicago river on one of many chicago boat tours, both of which were fantastic! After a long day out on the town we came back to the hotel to induldge in their in room spa treatments. My wife got the whole works (facial, manicure and pedicure, and hot stone massage therapy), while i enjoyed a deep tissue massage to get rid of some of the pain from walking around all day! For dinner we went downstairs and enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Harry Caray's Italian Steakhouse. Best steak I've ever had, hands down. When we were finished with dinner we just wanted to go back to our room and relax so we hopped into our comfortable king size bed, put in a movie with their in room dvd players and beautiful 32 inch HDTV's. For anyone looking for a nice relaxing getaway to the great city of Chicago, I would recommend The Amalfi Hotel Chicago to anyone. They offer anything you could ever want in a luxury hotel plus more. 
The Amalfi Hotel has become my absolute favorite place to stay when I visit Chicago. This place really knows how to treat their guests. They serve a complimentary breakfast on every floor and even have iPod docking stations in the room! If you want to watch a movie you can just borrow it from their collection. I took advantage of the free wi-fi AND the plush bathrobes. While I stayed there I had to try the spa services that were offered. Wonderful experience! The staff really made me feel comfortable during my stay and I will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to Chicago. 
I recently stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. I must say, that staying at this hotel is like staying at a high end hotel for celebrities. There are spa packages, room service, and the hotel is decorated extremely beautifully. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking to be treated like a star. They take reservations, and also have a great restaurant right inside of the building. Whatever you need, they will accommodate you. This is heaven on earth! I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel, even if its for one day, its worth it.
I recently stayed at the Amalfi Chicago with my wife on a business trip. We decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded. We enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city. The individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service. The Amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more. Our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site. The hotel's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses. Lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable. Breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt. Being of European descent, I enjoyed the croissants, whole grain muffins, real butter and marmalade. We also brought along our Standard Poodle, Sterling, and the Amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family. We purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed Sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings. Sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling "at home" while away. For pet lovers this is a big plus. Finally, transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal. This allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this, another appreciated bonus of our stay. Thank you Amalfi for a superb experience. 
My fiance and I had taken a trip to Chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to Downtown, so he chose the Amalfi Hotel, located conveniently to everything we needed. This place was phenomenal!!! He chose a romantic getaway package, as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever. The hotel is super clean and very chic; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb. We were able to bring along our dog, which was also really important to us. The first day we were there, we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple's massage. The masseuses come straight to your room so it's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great. After our massages, we went to the Keefer Steakhouse, which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic. They do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the Rocket grill, which was nice as well. In all, our 3 nights there were pretty similar, we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there; I've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the Windy City.
Amalfi Hotel Chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time. Its proximity to some of the best spots in Chicago makes it a visitor's delight. It is close to the Magnificient Mile which is the shopping area, it is also close to the Loop, Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space. Each guest room includes a flat screen HD TV. The beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast. The 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business.The hotel has a no-smoking policy. It also has free internet facilities, room service, Air conditioning, laundry/drycleaning, multilingual staff to make communication easy, spa services, heating, conference facilities, satelite tv, brailed elevators and pets are allowed. The Concierge desk offer the best wine available and I must add that the wine is great. The hotel prides itself in making you feel like royalty. The staff are very pleasant and the door men are always willing to lend a hand. The hotel places priority on cleanliness as the rooms are always clean. The hotel makes it possible for you to relax, go shopping in the best stores which are close-by, eat in some of the best restaurants and party in clubs most of which they have entered into some form patnership. They offer great deals for every type of customer. I would definitely recommend this place.
having stayed in standard hotels before, when my wife suggested we stay in an upscale hotel for our weekend in Chicago I was skeptical to say the least. After staying at the Amalfi Hotel I may never stay in a regular motel again! Right off the bat instead of a 40 foot counter with snooty workers or kids that started two days ago they have individual desks for check in with people that *gasp* have a clue as to what they are doing. We got the steakhouse package deal at the on-site Keefer's Steakhouse restaurant the food was the highest quality and cooked to perfection. The room was spacious had robes and slippers, a stocked mini-bar, The mattress was comfy, and the whole room was clean. The staff was amazing and had no problems bringing extra towels and pillows for my wife. In the morning the continental breakfast was served on each floor instead of herding into the lobby which I loved cause I love breakfast but not crowds. Unfortunately for me the hotel was close to a lot of shopping, my wife was in heaven however, and we spent a large portion of the day on the magnificent mile attempting to max out my credit cards. The whole trip I believe was made special by the atmosphere of the hotel and its staff I would recommend the Amalfi to anyone visiting Chicago.
This hotel allowed me to experience the best of Chicago. The central downtown location was perfect for me and my boyfriend to come and go as we pleased, whether during the day or at night. It was a great get-away spot for me to relax away from work. Probably one of the best beds I've ever slept on. The Italian food that they served at Harry Carey's reminded me of when I lived in Italy. Overall a completely amazing experience. I can't wait to book my next stay here.
My wife and me stayed in the Amalfi Hotel Chicago last August in a weekend visit to Chicago. The hotel is located in the 20 W Kinzie St, in the well-known River North District. We got what the hotel promised: gentle staff, a luxury room with a breathtaking view, magnificent meals and a select wine. I also used its well-equipped gymnasium. We paid $586 with taxes for two nights. I think it was a good price, taking in account the excellent conditions we got there. I would recommend the Amalfi Hotel to anybody with good taste that visits Chicago.
The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is perfect for a romantic get-away. My husband and I spent a weekend away from the kids there and I must say, we were impressed by the staff and the accomodations. We especially enjoyed the in-room spa service. I recommend the Amalfi to anyone wanting a nice hotel in the downtown Chicago area (you are within walking distance of shopping) with great customer service and luxury accomodations!
I got married in the Chicago area this passed weeknd and my guests all stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel. They had nothing but nice things to say about it! My husbands mother is terribly picky about where she stays and this hotel met her needs. The rooms are decorated so nicely and they don't have that funny hotel smell. The Pump Room was a fun place for the men to hang and watch sports. If I'm ever in the area again I will be sure to book a room at the Ambassador East Hotel!
My stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was a pleasant one. I loved being able to take a quick stroll to Michigan Ave for some shopping. I also loved the Pump Room. What a fun place to hang out and enjoy a Blood Mary. The front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost. They found me a room immediately even though the city was book up. I thought the rooms were clean and well maintained. The shampoo was great and I decided to take it home with me. I am looking forward to another stay at the Ambassador EAst in the spring when I return to Chicago. 
For a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel, I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location. The hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed, and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot. The food is good, location is great, everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here.
The Ambassador East Hotel Hello my current visit to the Ambassador East Hotel. I really enjoy my 3 day weekend stay at this Hotel. This was my first time at the hotel and I reserved a king size suite. Inside my room there was nice view of Chicago's Gold Coast. I really needed to get some work done for my business trip and this room was perfect for the situation. I could easily relax on my king size bed. I watch HBO on a enormous size flat screen TV for free. Also when I did do my work there was nice wooden desk in my room with a desk lamp and wifi modem. It so nice to have my laptop with me and able to use it on a good workstation in my room. After finishing my work I have time to check the complimentary fitness room. Lastly I left the next day, I had one of the finest breakfast dishes from their Pump Room restaurant. Overall the Ambassador East Hotel is a 5 out 5 hotel and really worth the stay. 
My husband and I came to the Ambassador East Hotel for my sister's wedding. The hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over 200 guests. When we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were, helping us check and get our guests situated. They were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest's rooms. Our rooms were clean and beautifully appointed, with a view of the city. We held the rehearsal dinner/groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall. After my sister was married in a church downtown, we held the reception in the large banquet hall. Again the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner, the DJ and all of the wedding's decorations. We had a great time. Ambassador East Hotel is highly recommended!
Wow! Loved the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago! It was so close to all the great sights of Chicago like Navy Pier, Lake Michigan, and all the fabulous dining. The hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional, but cozy manner. The entire family loved it, even the dog...because they are also pet friendly at the Ambassador East Hotel! We loved the restaurant there, the Pump Room was great, something to please even the pickiest of our eaters. We were there on a family get-away, but asked to see a larger "suite". The suites were gorgeous. I can't wait to tell our friends about this place! Our next business trip to Chicago, we are booking at this hotel. They have the perfect conference rooms and we LOVE the service! We are definitely coming back!
The Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago is a fantastic up-scale hotel to stay in while visiting the Windy City. My fiancee and I enjoyed one of the king rooms on our recent stay. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful - some of the best I've ever dealt with when traveling, and valet parking is always a perk! The rooms were very nice and had all the amenities you would want when at a high-end hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable! There was cable TV, of course, and HBO was included, so there was always something to watch. Wireless internet signal was excellent and I had no trouble getting online. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant twice during our stay, and the food was fantastic! Great atmosphere as well - we usually only do the hotel restaurant one night on a stay, but this one was worth going back to! Overall, it was an incredible stay, and we hope to stay at the Ambassador East again next time we're in Chicago! 
I have to thank the Ambassador East Hotel for providing a really great experience for my family. We never leave our dog at home when we travel, and it's been a long time since we've been able to find a place of this caliber that allows pets. The staff even spent time cooing over how cute our dog is when we asked about local clothing boutiques. My husband liked the fitness room. It was nice and clean, with plenty of extra towels available. It was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water, but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves. We will definitely be staying here next time we visit Chicago. We would make the trip just to stay here. That's how welcome we felt when we stayed at this hotel.
Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago, I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff. From the moment we checked-in until we left; the staff, from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating. Since we had our two daughters with us, we booked the traditional double room. The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too. It had plenty of room for the four of us--or should I say five of us. The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi, our teacup Chihuahua. Fortunately, the Amabassador East allows small pets (with a pet waiver). That made everybody happy! The location is great as well. Conviently located. Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive. Close to the museums. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago. I'll be staying here again!
This was the best choice my husband and I could have chosen to visit! The Hotel has stunning views from all around and the best part is that it is near the water! I was perfectly happy to enjoy the luxurious rooms and comfortable decor while my husband enjoyed the solace the found in the free gym. Everything was so clean and invoting. Especially The Pump Room; there was so much history in one rooom. Overall, we had a great, relaxing vacation away from the kids. I would definitely return to the Ambassador next time we're in the area!
From the moment I stepped into the Ambassador East Hotel, I was very much impressed!! The entire staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant. The bell staff escorted my husband and I right up to our suite. Our suite was beyond belief. The atmosphere was very classy and romantic. My husband previously arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room when we arrived. We had traveled to Chicago, from New York, for a romantic weekend get away. We had dinner that night at the hotel restaurant, The Pump House, and were very pleased. Dinner started with soup and a salad, main course meal and dessert, all for a reasonable price. We did a little local shopping the next day, after a very well rested night in their wonderfully comfortable king sized beds. Every interaction with the staff was a postitive experience. We enjoyed our weekend get away and would most definitely return to the Ambassador East Hotel the next time that we are in Chicago, Illinois. 5 stars....
amazing and beautiful! i stayed two nights here and the room was immaculate. All of the staff were extremely nice and welcoming. The food was delicious and fixed to perfection. The entire hotel was clean, warm and inviting. Will definitely stay here again and recommend to any of my friends traveling to the area.
How should I start? Well, after staying at the Ambassador East Hotel, i realized it was my favorite hotel ever. The rooms are amazing. The food is great. The Pump room bar is awesome. I love this hotel. If your ever in Chicago, the Ambassador East Hotel is the place to go.
If you're looking for an elegant hotel in downtown Chicago, you have to stay here. The Ambassador East Hotel has very comfortable and beautiful large rooms and is like a home away from home. The perfect place for a business person, and if you have a small pet you can bring them too! I would give this place four stars and would definitely stay here again.
The Ambassador East Hotel is a business that certainly strives to keep its customers satisfied. Upon my entrance at the Ambassador East, I was greeted warmly. The staff was incredibly pleasant, and the accommodations were top-knotch. The food served at the award-winning "Pump Room" was to die for, and the service was fast but friendly. 
O.M.G best hotel ever ! i've stayed at various hotels in the area and the service has been really suckish. evan at one hotel i stayed at they had a molded sandwhich under the bed , how gross and i could of really got sick ! but this hotel was the perfect location right by the beach and by all the clubs . ohh . and the pump room , the best food i've evr had at a hotel . i evan got to take a picture with Queen Anne ! i will never regret coming to this hotel! i loved this hotel so much me and my bridemaid's stayed here . and it's just walking distance from all the popular food places and clubs . ( all the places to be at least )
I am writing about my recent stay at the Ambassador East Hotel. I just wanted to let you know what a wonderful team you have working there. Everyone from check-in to check-out couldn't have been more helpful or personable. It made my mundane business trip a very pleasureable one. The hotel is spotless, very comfortable and the restaurant is one of Chicago's finest. You really offer the finest quality in both product and service. The only complaint I have is that internet access is not free. I would just like to mention one person in particular- Sofie. She worked on the front desk and she went above and beyond to make my stay as smooth as possible. She even helped me out with taxi services and local recommendations. I shall look forward to returning next month. Thank you. Yours, P. Grady 
I enjoyed my stay at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago. The staff was friendly and helpful from the time I checked in all the way through checkout. The hotel was very clean and well maintained. The beds were very comfortable! The hotel restaurant/lounge was very cozy and a nice way to unwind after a long day. The only thing I was unhappy about was the fact that internet service is not complimentary at this hotel. I reccomend this hotel and I will stay there again on my next trip to Chicago!
The Ambassador East Hotel, located in downtown Chicago, is one of the BEST hotels I've ever stayed in. My wife and I went into the city on a weekend getaway and found the Ambassador East on a hotel booking website. Their rates are very, very reasonable for the high class and luxury that they provide. I was pleased to know that they allow pets as we decided to go into the city last minute and couldn't find anyone to watch our dog for the weekend. I was more than pleased with the friendly staff and felt like their hotel put an extra emphasis on knowing their customer, which is nice because most places in Chicago are very impersonal. All in all i was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area. 5/5 Stars. 
The stunning bay at Chicago finds its equal in the Ambassador East Hotel. This hotel feels like luxury was built into everything, down to the wonderful room service and conference rooms. Besides being in an active neighborhood in Chicago, the Ambassador East is close enough to the action and beautiful sights Chicago has to offer. The overall service of the hotel was wonderful. I felt like I was treated as a king. The room was very neat, regal, and relaxing. I especially liked the bathroom as it was clean and soothing. The Pump Room was also a great place for excellent dining. My stay here was completely enjoyable while maintaining a high level of productivity. Overall, the stay here was fantastic and worth every penny. I would return to the Ambassador East Hotel in a heartbeat if given the opportunity.
Located right in the heart of downtown Chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip. The first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is, and how clean the rooms are (even compared to other luxury hotels) seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the Terrace and get a drink, i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed, i've had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones, once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent, bed was soft and the TV didn't appear burned out at all. Overall i give this a five out of five, the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect, i wish i could have stayed longer.
The Talbott Hotel was very classy, professional, and luxurious. I loved how the staff was nice and respectful. I was treated like i was royalty when i was there, when in checked i was greeted by all of the people working behind the front desk and was offered a tour of the hotel. They took my bags and put them in my room while i was taking the tour and they even escorted me to my room right after we were done. This is a very nice and modern looking and their rooms are spacious and clean unlike other hotels in their area. I have recommended this hotel to all of my family and friends and would recommend it to anyone who is going to stay in that area. 
My wife and I booked a Deluxe Accessible Room at this beautiful hotel for three nights. The wonderful photos don't do the hotel justice. It couldn't have been a more ideal stay. The room was spacious and and clean, the bathroom sparkling, with every amenity one could imagine. The bed felt like it had been just delivered. Our views of downtown Chicago were spectacular. On top of all of this, the hotel staff was extremely helpful. They explained the best routes to the restaurants we wanted to eat at, and they even went as far as securing us reservations for the places they knew would be busy! Believe everything good that you read. If you visit Chicago, stay at the Conrad Chicago.
We stayed here for a weekend trip to Chicago and we will come back and stay here again. It was great place front desk clerks were very helpful.Also we loved the view. Very nice quiet place and upto date and super clean. We will def stay here again highly recommended.
My visit to the Conrad Chicago in the heart of downtown was a luxurious experience bar none. The lobby is immaculate and is filled with reams of class and style. The rooms are beautifully adorned. I especially like the flat screen TV and wired internet. I'm never happy with wireless connections so it is nice to find a hotel that knows that its guests need fast, reliable internet connectivity, and it's included at no additional charge. The view from the room was magnificent...downtown Chicago at night! The Restaurant is spectacular but the Terrace is the place to be when weather permits. You cannot get a more breathtaking view and be able to relax in the gentle breeze of evening while dining on the finest gourmet foods. Don't forget to visit the Health and Fitness center with their selection of aerobic and anaerobic workout equipment. The staff is attentive to your every need and the concierges can get you whatever you need. Just ask! This is the place to stay in Chicago if you want to be pampered in luxury!
The Conrad Chicago was by far the best experience I have ever had in travel leisure. Not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable, but the food in the restaurant was exquisite. Not to mention the perfect service from the resort's employees! I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs. I'm naturally a fitness freak, so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor. Best of all, it was available to guests at any time, day or night. The resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area, so it wasn't a far walk to scope out the shops. The most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up. It was so relaxing just watching the city come to life. I was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave. Any time that I make my way back to Chicago, you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago. I recommend this resort to everyone I know who does a lot of traveling.
This hotel is absolutely amazing. I have paid to stay in Hotels that cost an arm and a leg only to get crappy service in return. However, here it's comfortable, friendly, and a vacation. In fact, all vacations start with your lodging, and how can you have a good vacation with poor lodging? The beds are comfortable, clean, and upscale, while still being homey enough to be relaxed. The services and staff are tops, and the view from the rooms is absolutely gorgeous! And I must commend the cleanliness! Nice place to stay, and worth every penny! Will definitely be coming back! 
The hotel was very nice; Service was great, everyone was very friendly. The room was very elegant and classy. The bed was so comfortable. The room also had a flat screen TV and Bose sound system. Not bad. Overall I had a great experience; with a pleasant staff and perfectly comfortable room, I left here well rested and happy. 
If you are looking for a luxurious downtown Chicago experience, the Conrad Chicago is the place to stay. The rooms are equipped with the most comfortable beds dressed with the most luxurious bedding, a 42 inch flat screen television, a spa like bathroom with marble vanity and soaking tub, and views of downtown Chicago that will take your breath away. The hotel has many amenities for you to enjoy while you are there including great restaurants and bars, high speed internet, a fitness facility and laundry services. This hotel was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality place to stay in downtown Chicago.
I stayed at the the Conrad Chicago Hotel last winter with my family and I couldn't be happier with are choice. The staff was very polite and helpfull and the rooms were very comfortable and felt like home. I loved the area of chicago the hotel was in there wasnt alot of crim around and i felt safe being in a new city.
Conrad Chicago it was 5:00 AM my plan just flew in and I was tired I checked myself into the Confad Chicago when I first got there there was a creepy employe the floor was filthy but I got my room in the 5th level of then as I dashed towards the elevator my suite case in hand I entered it then that's where I started to see the beauti of the place the walls where polished wood there was even a small AC/heater unit and it was good. Then out of no where Ting I made it up there this place was great the carpets where velveteen it was a true luxurious hotel I found my rooms and was greeted to a golden door nob I was living in paradise after I got into my room it was a perfect! The room was a perfect 68 degrees. I was shocked to find how confrotable the bed was... perfect! And it had leather pillows and a huge blanket then just when I didn't think it could get any better I look my bathroom its perfect stone and gold! The water actually has a good taste to it like grapes I was so shocked I fell uncontentious I was drowning cause my face fell into the toilet then I woke up you wont believe how fast the assistance will save your life there! I when t back up into my floor and guess what I say out the windows a swimming pool and it was huge Olympic sized swimming pool It was great. I got on my beach suit and went down there and it was heated over all I don't think I can leave and all of the other swimmers where pretty nice rich people and they where alright though a little big stuck up but not too much. Then came dinner time perfect. I must say I am extremely satisfied with my visit! Time to fly back to where I cam from and then my plan took off i'm going to miss that hotel 10/10!
I had a great experience staying at the Conrad Chicago, the service was top notch, the price was good, but out of everything the service was outstanding. I would definitely stay there again when in the area and would suggest it to anyone looking for a good quality hotel in a great location. Right next to the shops at North Bridge!
If you're looking for luxuary, look no more. The Conrad is the best. I was in Chicago on business, and had to stay much longer than anticipated. A coworker suggested this hotel and boy am I glad he did. The location is perfect, you're close to everything. The best part is the Conrad is a smoke free hotel. I'll be back soon. Very Satisfied
My wife and I checked in to this hotel after a rough flight from Los Angeles. We decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel while visiting our recently graduated son, and we were not disappointed. The location could not have been better, as we were afforded easy access to Chicago's culture and shopping by being just off Michigan Avenue. After a long day of exploring the city, we enjoyed a fantastic dinner on the terrace overlooking the city. The halibut was cooked just right, and our waiter made us feel very welcome with some friendly conversation. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Chicago! 
My husband and I stayed at the Conrad Chicago on our 1st anniversary tripped and had a WONDERFUL experience thanks to the staff. Not only is the hotel and a great location with many places to eat and socialize within walking distance, but they rooms were also clean and quiet. The staff was helpful and accommodated our requests. We'll definitely be staying here again next time we visit Chicago! Also if you stay you MUST eat at The Restaurant. Fabulous food!
We were amazed by this hotel. The first great part is the location. Its so close to some of the great shopping the city has to offer. The view from the terrace suite at night was breathtaking looking over Chicago. They even had a florist, as I bought my wife a rose. The menus, the lobby, everything was fantastic. The room was clean when we arrived as it was every time we came back to it each day. I didn't use the fitness center but it looked very nice, I did however visit the bar....and when i return to Chicago, I will again.
Having recently been in Chicago for business and based on proximity and aesthetics, I decided to reserve a room at the Conrad Hotel in Chicago and I couldn't have been more delighted with every aspect of my two-night stay. Every conceivable amenity is available from the 42" plasma flat-screen to both wired and wireless internet connections available I was able to stay in constant contact with the office all while in the enviable lap of luxury. My room was not only comfortable and clean, but warm and inviting just as if it were home away from home. If you're in the Chicago area, reserve a room at the Conrad Hotels and Resorts and you will not be disappointed. 
The rooms were beautiful! The staff was friendly and helpful. I love where the Conrad in Chicago was located, it seemed to be close to a lot of places I wanted to visit. Chicago was great, and the Conrad Hotel made my family and my stay that much more exceptional!
Conrad Chicago is one of the nicer hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in recently. The rooms were well furnished and brightly lit, but not to the point of garishness. The convenient location was a plus.
I went to stay at this hotel last year. I have got to say it was a great authentic experience, the dining Restaurant was clean and fantastic the rooms were very comfortable with a friendly staff. Its location couldn't be more perfect so close you can walk to do some shopping. Looking at it from the outside at night is very beautiful. It is very affordable. I recommend this place to anyone and plan on staying again the next time i come to town.
WOW! That is all I can say! My girlfriends and I recently went on a little 'excursion' to Chicago for a girls weekend and we stayed at this beautiful hotel. The rooms were beautifully decorated in a comfortable, modern style. The beds were so comfortable and cozy with the softest bedding I have ever felt on a hotel bed. Our views were just as amazing. We could even see Lake Michigan from our suite. We only dined in the hotel once during our trip, but it was the best time we had. The Aria Restaurant was so elegant yet fun. Very clean and just a great atmosphere. The staff was extremely professional and courteous, going out of their way to ensure our stay was a pleasure from the moment we walked through their doors. Highly recommended! A must see next time you visit this area. 
The Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park Hotel provides a rich, beautiful, cultured atmosphere. During my stay, I felt like royalty. With unparalleled design schemes and beautiful, tranquil views, the mood during my entire stay was one of bliss. The guest services department was second-to-none. The staff throughout the hotel were obviously concerned with pleasing the customer and making my stay as wonderful as possible. When dealing with a staff member at Fairmont, I felt as if I were the only guest in the place. The food and drink selections were vast and fit for a king. I will definitely recommend Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park to my friends and colleagues. I will also greatly look forward to my next stay.
Fantastic Hotel! Upscale and luxurious, and in a great location! Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty! The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean, the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for! My husband and I had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone, and can't wait to get back there myself!
My three night stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect way to end a weekend. The hotel has a classy but warm atmosphere with color tones that please the mind and soothe the eyes. The staff was ready to help at any notice and always greeted you with a cheerful smile. The mySpa was the getaway of a life time. My only complaint would be that the bed covers were a bit too stiff as they were new and clean but the softness of the bed whisked me away to a deep slumber in no time. Well worth the money and I know my next stay will be much longer. 
When my new fiance told me about his business trip to Chicago I was quite annoyed. Mostly because he insisted I come along. He made up for me so not wanting to come along and be alone all weekend, with this wonderful hotel. His mother told him all about this hotel when she and her husband stayed here in the summer of 2008. She loved it..and so did I! I was so bummed about being all alone for most of the weekend, but the decor, wonderful staff and massages made up for it! I spent my time in the spa and the asian restaurant and couldn't have asked for a better experience! I am definately coming along on the next business trip!
My husband and I visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park for our honeymoon. The customer service was amazing. From the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing. These people were proficient, respectful and very thoughtful. The Fairmont had a lounge, a wine room, a bar and a restaurant. I couldn't decide where I wanted to go first! After we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room... It was totally delicious. We also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon! Then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa, once again excellent!! Everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time. We stayed in the gold room. Although it was a little bit smaller than I thought it would be I was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows. My husband and I relaxed in fluffy white bath robes while we sipped champagne while we watched the sparkling lights of the city. It was a wonderful experience that I will never forget. Four thumbs up! 
Fairmont Chicago was a great choice for my wife and I. We couldn't resist the elegant Aria Restaurant and the accommodations. The room was impeccably clean and the city view was utterly amazing. From the moment we checked in, the staff produced a positive atmosphere with genuine hospitality. My wife even suggested we should have had our wedding reception in their beautiful ball room. Overall, I would rate Fairmont Chicago a 10/10!
I just spent the weekend here with my wife, and she loved it as much as I do. I was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients, so I didn't have any choice. But when my wife said she wanted to come to Chicago, I knew this was the place to take her. The hotel hasn't just been remodeled, it's been completely redesigned. Things have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better, and the two rooms that I've seen are showplaces. They are amazing. This hotel is part of a luxury chain, and it's easy to see why. They offer full room service at convenient hours. I've been in every eating area now, and they are all great, too. Whether for business or pleasure, you can't beat this. It's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you'd expect. My wife was stunned, and yours will be, too. 
I recently made a business trip to Chicago, in which I stayed at the downtown Fairmont hotel. During my visit, I had an aroma-harmony massage. This experience greatly relieved my stress, from all the business meetings I'd had that day. Candace worked wonders for my neck muscles, especially. This was the only amenity that I sought out, during my trip. My time was very limited. However, the entire staff at this hotel treated me as if I were a valued guest. I'll definately stay at this hotel again when I'm in the area. And, I highly recommend the spa!
My husband and I went to Chicago for three nights for a quick get-away. We chose Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park because it was located at the heart of the city, downtown Chicago. The hotel itself was very elegant and modern. The bed was extremely comfortable and I was able to wake up with music from my iPod. I would definitely stay with them again.
I had to write this review! My tired body walked through the doors of The Fairmont. It felt like I walked through heaven's gates, the lobby was majestic and the staff was so friendly, that I was instantly energized. The front desk staff was very helpful and quick to find my reservation and get my bags up to my room. They were so nice to inform me of the health club and spa..oh those wonderful spa treatments that are offered are incredible, I took advantage of a soothing pedicure during my visit (my very first) as well as a massage. I was amazed at the size of the meeting/conference room that we used for an afternoon. The room was so clean and the bed was better than the one at home. The food downstairs in the restaurant smelled so good that as tired as I was after the meeting, instead of room service, I went in,and the food was mouth watering delicious, and the wait staff was very hospitable They take great pride in everything, even the wake up call was friendly. My stay was so great, that I want to go back again soon!
I have just returned from my first stay at the remodeled Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and all I can say is fabulous! The modern decor and style hits you the minute you walk in. The front desk is a work of art. I stayed in the anything but standard guestroom. The modern decor, the beautiful artwork, this is the most relaxing hotel room I have ever stayed in. The bathroom is like having your own personal spa, all the marble tile is classic and modern at the same time. The rainfall showerhead is to die for people. If you have the time be sure to check out the fitness center and spa. Great new equipment to work up a sweat and all the pampering a body could ever needs awaits in the spa. I wish I could have stayed longer, next time I will be sure to add a couple of "me" days to my trip and I'm sure I won't even think of going outside those doors.
 While travelling for business I had my family join me and we stayed at the Fairmont Chicago, Millennium Park. It is breathtakingly beautiful and plush. The rates for rooms, though not the cheapest choice are quite reasonable for such fabulous amenities. The room decor is elegant modern and my wife says the spa is divine! Guests of this hotel are able to live in luxury - every room is equipped with complementary coffee, access to high speed internet, bathrobes, and 42 inch flat screen televisions. Enjoy the gorgeous city views and live the good life at the Fairmont Chicago, Millennium Park. 
My recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was everything I desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in Chicago. I loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a 42 inch flat screen television and iPod docking station. I appreciated the walking distance to all of Chicago's premiere shopping areas. The concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations, while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service. The services I received at at mySpa were some of the best in the world. Dinner at aria restaurant was delicious. In short, Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect luxury vacation, meeting all my needs and more!
The atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable; it has a very modern feel. The rooms were very well designed, and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means. The pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable. 
My husband and I stayed here for a short get-away weekend and loved it. It is so conveniently located close to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The staff was very helpful and the room was great. It was definitely worth every penny! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.
We recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park while travelling for business. What an incredible experience! Friends had stayed there years ago, but when we showed them our photos, they couldn't believe the amazing renovations. While we loved the modern decor and style, our main reason for choosing this hotel was because of what they call Fairmont PURE rooms. I have had so many awful allergy attacks while travelling, so I wasn't too optimistic that they could actually make a truly hypoallergenic and allergy-free room. I have to say I felt great during our entire stay. We enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine and incredible cheese and appetizers at Eno. What a treat to get such amazing food and wine without even having to walk out of the hotel. This hotel is truly beautiful, everything you would expect from a high-end, big city hotel. Our stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park didn't disappoint us in any respect. Our only disappointment? We don't have a reason to go back to Chicago anytime soon, but I have a feeling we will be making reservations for another visit in the very near future. 
This hotel is amazing, I would recommend everyone to stay at least one night here if they had the chance. I stayed here on my first honeymoon and they had all the accommodations I expected plus more. I was floored by the friendliness of the staff and they definitely went the extra mile to make everything perfect without any hassle. The restaurants at the Fairmont were amazing as well. When staying at this Hotel, food and wine at their best are portrayed. If I had to make the choice to stay here again, the only thing that I would do differently is schedule the stay to be twice as long (it was so relaxing!!). Already booked another stay for next year I enjoyed it so much. 
My husband and I recently visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel on one of his business trips. I sometimes go along with him to see new places and to splurge on a mini-vacation while he is hard at work (don't worry- he likes when I return with little "souvenirs" for him, too). Aside from the lovely city of Chicago, this hotel was just amazing! We had gotten in quite late that evening from our flight from Houston and were so tired! The staff was genuine and friendly, all while being professional and prompt. We were quickly checked in and before we knew it we were in our beautiful room. Too tired to really take it in, we were in bed and asleep in minutes. The beds were quite welcoming! It wasn't until the next morning that we were able to really take in all of the beautiful features of this hotel! It's gorgeous! Everything was so clean and wonderfully decorated! The lobby somehow didn't make it into our sleepy eyes the night before, but it was just lovely! Later that evening we decided to eat at their sushi restaurant. Sushi is one of my husband's favorites, so he tends to be picky. They passed the test according to him! We also enjoyed a glass of wine there as well... everything tasted great and was of excellent quality. Of our two night stay there, the only downfall was one occasion of there not being enough towels (I use a lot of towels I suppose). However, a simple phone called prompted a quick delivery of fluffy additional ones. This however was only a minor bump in the road to an entirely enjoyable and relaxing stay! Overall-- we'd love to go there again! Maybe next time I can talk my husband into taking advantage of the spa... *wink* 
The windy city fairmont hotel is one of chicago's best recently renovated to bring it up to modern day luxury. With fine dining atmosphere and hotel deluxe suites and the view that is breath taking. This hotel can accommodate the guest no matter what you desire. with a fabulous restaurant on the 15Th floor with dinning at its best. With it over looking the great Chicago area. So the next time your in the windy city come and stay with us where you will be pamper by our fine staff.
When I planned my summer vacation, I was wanting to travel somewhere new. Chicago was on my mind because of the fast city life. I got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel. It was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there. The luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues. The room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious, I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied. I met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town. I enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later. 
When I first booked my reservation at this hotel, honestly, I didn't know what to expect. I mean, I'm kind of a music person, but this was my first real experience with a musically "themed" hotel. Upon staying here, however, I am convinced that I made the right choice in my stay. The dining accommodations were excellent, and I was served probably some of the best food I've ever eaten at a hotel. It was intelligently placed in downtown Chicago, and I wouldn't have to walk too far to see some street performers, or just take in the majesty of the city itself. The room I had booked had an excellent view of the skyline, and I could've easily sat for hours, just marveling at the city sprawled out before me. The whole "Hard Rock" and musical aspect of the hotel was just the icing on the cake of my stay. If I had to stay here again, I would! 
The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago has it all: location, comfort, and rockability! We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently and found it to be amazing! The location was perfect as it is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, and Lake Michigan. It was just a short ride by bus or cab to the sports stadiums, Shedd Aquarium or the Museum of Science and Industry! The food, although it was pricey, was great! There is a spa on site if you need a little time to relax and recoup after all that rockin', and if you have pets, they get the ROYAL treatment, complete with gifts! I would highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel of Chicago! 
Hard Rock Hotel is a must to visit. No matter what city your in Hard Rock Hotel is the place to stay. Filled with fun and unique traits to the rooms and dining. This Hotel is the place to be. Great views in every location, especially Chicago. The service is incredible along with the food and decor. The Hotel staff will help you feel right at home, no BETTER than home :)
I was looking for an unique, hip experience in a hotel that offered the convenient location of downtown Chicago. My choice for hotel was obvious: Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. If you are wondering whether Hard Rock Hotels are schmaltzy or cliche, they are not. Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is modern, trendy and hip. It had an air that this was where musicians came to rock among the 40 stories, and there are details that you won't find elsewhere. For example, one interesting perk is some free iTunes downloads (I got ten) for guests. It's a fun place, hosting events such as Jack Daniel's 160th birthday.
-Review of the Hard Rock Hotel- I find that the Hard Rock Hotel, located in Chicago, has extrodinary scenary. The hotel is extremely clean with shining furniture and the rooms are breathtaking. Hungry? Visit this hotel for yourself to see what excellence they provide at the dinner tables. The hotel also host events such as ballet, fun in the bar and a dj to name a few. This hotel is definitely worth your while. I will most definitely visit again. Book your reservation as soon as possible and don't forget your camera!
I traveled to Chicago recently with my giant German Shepard dog Rex and picked the Hard Rock Hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness. The service truly is incredible. They even had a web-cam so I could check in on Rex while I was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when I could not make it home from a meeting the day after. The rooms really rock (pardon the pun). Nothing like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets. The easy chair looked so good that I was almost afraid Rex would snack on it while I was out, but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better. I would definitely recommend the Hard Rock Hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets. 
While making the obligatory trip to the Chicago area to visit family, we decided to make it fun for the teenage members of our group and reserved a couple of rooms at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. What a great decision! The rooms are very upscale at a reasonable price with great amenities. And, according the younger members of the family, "very cool"! We can't wait to come back.
Set up an important meeting for some clients at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. They were flying to Chicago for a special trip to checkout the music scene and to discuss business with my company. Naturally, they wanted to stay here. The client really seemed to like their rooms, but felt the Paul Reed Smith room was too cramped for our day-long meeting (330 sq ft.). In a panic, I contacted the HRH staff and they actually had another, bigger, room available. We quickly moved our meeting in the Birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success. (Birdland room is 660 sq ft.) We have a new client and so does HRH. This is where the client wants to stay every time they fly in for future business meetings with us.
I have to say that the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is a cool place to stay. When I first got there, getting checked in was very fast. The lady at the counter was nice and well spoken. The bellhop had out bags into the room very fast. The room was very hip and cool. There was musical items all over the place. I really loved the Beatles art that was in my bathroom. After being in the room a few minutes, I got a call from the front desk asking me if I liked my room. They also asked me if I would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if I needed to use their business room. I needed some things shipped while I was there, which they had supplies to help me with that. After getting some work done, I called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around. They gave me information for 3 awesome places. I left and came back after having a night out on the town. They were very understanding that I was a wee bit out of it. I had more than pizza that night if you get my drift. When I got back to my room, the bed was so comfortable. I feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep. In the morning I order breakfast, which was really a Philly cheese steak. They will make anything you want anytime of day. I checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed. Thank You Hard Rock, You Rock!
My husband and I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago and we can't wait to go back! The hotel is located in downtown Chicago and seems to be at the heart of the city, we were close to everything. The Hard Rock Hotel is forty stories high and the view from our room was simply breathtaking. The room itself was spotless and featured modern luxurious decor and furnishings. The bed was heavenly. The hotel staff was friendly, upbeat and extremely helpful, we asked for directions and restaurant recommendations and they were spot on with both. I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. 
 The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is great alternative to ordinary hotels. The hotel is decorated with a huge variety of music memorabilia that makes the stay worth it alone. The hotel is often visited by many talented artists including singers, dancers,actors etc. The staff were very polite and helpful and always pleasant. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated, as were the common areas and hallways. I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the area.
Upon arriving to the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, I was immediately impressed. The staff was friendly and checked us in quickly, which is important to me after a long trip. Our room was immaculate and decorated in a clean modern style. The bed was very comfortable, including the linens which felt high quality, unlike what you get at some other hotels. All this made for a great night sleep. Perhaps the most impressive part of our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel was their "Party like a Rottweiler" package we added to our reservation. For an additional fee we were able to bring our pet and were provided with treats, toys and best of all the pet cam! We left our dog in the room with a pet cam and were able to watch him throughout the day on my iPhone! All in all this was a great place to stay and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to travel with their pet.
This fantastic hotel has it all: luxury, an excellent location and a fun atmosphere. The rooms are spacious and well decorated, and the staff is always helpful and courteous. Whether you're traveling for business or fun, I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. I stayed there with my wife recently, we were on a short weekend break and we wanted to enjoy the music an just have fun. The Hard Rock certainly delivered what we were looking for. The hotel is in a central location, within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city, however, there's superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for, so there's barely a need to leave to hotel! (well, we DID leave the hotel to see the sights, but you know what I mean). My wife and I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa facilities, including a relaxing massage. This hotel surpassed our expectations in every possible way, and we'll surely be staying there again the next time we visit the Windy City. 
I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago while in town for business, and enjoyed my stay very much. I stayed in a room with a king bed, which was very comfortable. The room had all the things I needed for my stay, which was nice. The only thing is I think there was a party on my floor, but they quieted down quickly enough. My room even had an internet connection! I also had dinner one night at the China Grill, and it was an amazing meal! Overall, I had a great stay, and will return next time I am in Chicago.
My husband and I recently stayed at your Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, and what a fantastic experience it was. We stayed in one of the 'Extreme Suites' and let me tell you it was beautiful. The furniture and paintings were amazing and the view was to die for. The staff treated us really well and met all of our needs and then some. I especially loved the spa. We stayed for a week but I could have stayed a lot longer. It was very comfortable and welcoming. We will make sure to recommend your hotel to our friends and will be back the next time we are in Chicago. Thanks so much!
I loved staying at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, not only is it an amazingly friendly atmosphere, but they give me the option to bring my pet with me. They are a dog friendly hotel, it costs $55.00 a night for the dog to stay with you, but that beats the costs of paying a kennel to keep or your dog or a neighbor to watch them for you. I loved this option. They also give your animals a gift bag filled with treats, food, bowls and doggy clean up bags. I higly reccomend this hotel if you are looking for a place to bring your four-legged friend with you when you travel. 
Staying at the Hard Rock Hotel is one of best bets you can ever make while traveling. I stayed at this one the last time I visited Chicago and it was just wonderful. The rooms are amazing and the one I stayed in had a great view of the city. The beds were comfortable and everything was really clean and neat, the Wi-Fi was really fast and always available and I liked the fact that you could get a guitar at the front desk and jam in your own room with a pair of headphones. I didn't have the chance to use the spa, but I could tell it was really nice and relaxing. I did go to the Base Bar a couple times for a drink, very cool atmosphere and great drinks to choose from. The Rock shop was pretty cool too and I bought a bunch of shirts to bring back home to family and friends. Overall I think this is one of the coolest hotels you could stay in, the experience is definitely different than any other hotel I've stayed in.
After searching for the perfect hotel for my Chicago getaway I knew once I came across the Hard Rock Hotel, that this was the hotel for me. After seeing the exceptional accommodations the hotel offered, I booked my reservations right away. When I arrived at the hotel I was astonished at how beautiful and big the building and grounds were kept. I was greeted warmly by the front staff and received my room key within a few minutes. I was also given helpful pointers to nearby attractions and restaurants. I took the elevator up to my room, and when I opened the door my jaw dropped as the views of the Chicago skyline was impeccable. After relaxing I went down to the bar for a few cocktails and was impressed by the fast, courteous service I received. After my cocktail hour, I decided to unwind and let me tell you the beds must be sent from heaven. I had one of the best nights of sleep I have had in a long time. I highly recommend the Hard Rock as I have stayed at many around the US and this is definitely on my top 5 list. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did, and I can't wait to return. Ashley B.
the experince at the hard rock hotel in chicago was fantastic,i will rate them a 6 out of 5. they have wonderful service and great staff and the view is just wonderful.
My husband and I satayed for two nights at the Hilton Chicago,and enjoyed every minute of it! The bedrooms are immaculate,and the linnens are very soft. We also appreciated the free wifi,as we could stay in touch with friends while staying in Chicago. The bathroom was quite spacious,and I loved the smell of the shampoo they provided-not like most hotel shampoos. Their service was amazing,and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool. I would recommend staying here to anyone.
The Hilton Chicago was amazing!! It is close to almost everything that Chicago has to offer! We could walk to Lake Michigan, Grant Park, Niketown, Watertower place, etc. The rooms were very nice and refreshed every day. Also, they allow pets!! You don't have to go far to get good food because they have a few different restaurants right there! Overall experience was an A++.
Excellent hotel in the heart of Chicago. The room we stayed in had a great view of Lake Michigan. We went in July for a vacation and everything is easily accesible from the hotel. Most major attractions are in around the Loop area. We also got a great deal on the price. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago - its in the right spot for both business and pleasure.
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding. The service was impeccable. Not only was the staff attentive, they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. The amenities were great, and after an open bar the night before, the Mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! I would love to have my wedding there.
The Downtown Chicago Hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions. Staying with a Hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always, the room was clean and impeccably neat, the staff friendly and very capable. The wireless access and big flat screen TV were an added plus too! Best of all, it is a pet-friendly hotel, something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels. Thanks, Chicago Hilton, for a great stay!
The Chicago Hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic. The hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city. The room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful. I can't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there. 
My husband and I stayed in the Hilton Chicago and had a very nice stay! The rooms were large and comfortable. The view of Lake Michigan from our room was gorgeous. Room service was really good and quick,eating in the room looking at that view, awesome! The pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it. Great location for all of the downtown Chicago attractions such as theaters and museums. Very friendly staff and knowledgable, you cant go wrong staying here. 
My stay here was superb. The view from my windows was stunning, as I looked out I could see the beautiful Grant Park. The room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting. The bed was very comfortable. The wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips. THe hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca. Overall I thouroughly enjoyed my stay here. 
I stayed here for a weekend while visiting some friends in town. It was a little pricey, but definitely worth it! The staff was super friendly, the pool was clean and well-maintained, and they even had a really good veggie burger in the restaurant downstairs (I'm a vegetarian). Plus, I paid for a room with a lake view and it was gorgeous. I would definitely recommend. 
We chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close! What I didn't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable. I can't remember when I got a better night's sleep. The staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept. We'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we're in town!
The Hilton Chicago is one of the best Hotels I have ever had the good fortune to lodge at in my entire life. It is an extremely luxirious hotel located on the "Cultural Michigan Avenue Mile", and it overlooks Grant Park, Lake Michigan, and Museum Campus. In addition to overlooking those wonderful sights, it's also located conveniently close to Chicago's convention center, McCormick Place Convention Center, as well as the business center, shopping and theatre. Furthermore, there are a myriad of attractions close to the hotel, such as Millenium Park, Buckingham Park, and the Sears Tower. The amenities offered by the Hilton Chicago hotel include 100% wireless Internet access in all guest rooms, 27" inch flat screen televisions, a Serenity Bed, and two-line direct dial phones. And on top of all that, the hotel is pet friendly! I'll definitely be staying here again.
The Hilton Hotel helped us make the most of our trip to Chicago. Not only are they centrally located near most of Chi towns hot spots, but they also helped coordinate discounted admissions to various other attractions. The Hilton is very classy with their accommodations. I will be returning at my earliest convenience, be it for business or pleasure.
This hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago. It is ideal for the corporate executive. Not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean. The dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience. While dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city, which is picturesque especially at night, when the city lights come on. The rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area. I would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive!
The stay at the Hilton Chicago definetely felt like a vacation. Sleeping in that big wonderful bed felt like I was at home! The accommodations and hotel are beautiful. I especially enjoyed the gym. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would reccommend this Hotel to anyone who is looking for a home away from home.
Last week I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for 4 days and 3 nights and I was very pleased with the experience. As soon as I approached the front desk, I knew right away the staff was friendly and courteous. They had given me a list of local attractions such as the Museum of Science and Industry, the Broadcast Museum, the Ford Center For The Performing Arts and Willis Tower. I stayed in a junior suite which included a king size bed, a 27 inch television, non-allergenic feather pillows and a variety of other amenities. The indoor pool was rather large as well as the gym which includes countless treadmills and even a jogging track. Eating in the area is not a problem as the Hilton Chicago is home to Kitty O'Sheas which is a restaurant offering authentic Irish fare. In conclusion, I had a wonderful time staying here and I can not wait to plan my return trip to the Hilton Chicago.
Our stay at the Hilton Chicago was a pleasure from arrival to departure. The staff was super friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and the location was fantastic. The walking track was an especially nice touch. Highly recommended!
great hotel. went for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time. The hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at. Beautifull location on michigan ave downtown chicago overlooking grant park beautifull scenery. Great staff and wonderfull food as well, i would recomend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a nice vacation or going for work.
My family chose to stay at the Chicago Hilton during our last trip to the city. We wanted something luxurious and centrally-located without having to pay exorbitant prices. I can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the Hilton. The staff treated us well, the rooms were clean and roomy (we loved the Serenity beds), and the hotel itself is stunning. It was like stepping back in time. We loved that the Chicago Hilton was close to numerous attractions. The weather was lovely, so it was great to walk to Navy Pier, Sears Tower, and the Adler Planetarium. We will definitely stay at the Hilton the next time we are in Chicago.
The Hilton in Chicago was awesome. The room was very clean and the hotel staff was very professional. One of the features I liked, was that in my room the internet access was wire and wireless, considering my laptop is not wireless, it help me out alot. Food was very good, quality was great. There was also a flat screen in my room...awesome. The hotel itself is locaated in the middle of alot of resturants with fin dinning. I also enjoyed the gym very much. Overall, I enjoyed myself, and I will stay again at the Hilton when I return to Chicago.
Me and my wife recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago while on vacation, and I can't recommend it enough. The hotel is located right on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago, and right next to tons of great restaurants and stores. The rooms are spacious and elegant; they are modern and stylish without being crazy or garish. I especially liked the big flat screen TV and the very comfy bed, sleeping in hotel rooms is often far from relaxing but I had no problem falling asleep. I highly recommend the Hilton Chicago, I'll definitely stay there again. A+ 
My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a four-day weekend in downtown Chicago and do all the touristy things; shop the Magnificient Mile, see Shedd aquarium, go to the museum of Science and Industry. Homewood Suites was conveniently located near all of these things. It was a luxurious treat of a weekend! We even swam in their rooftop indoor pool. It was also nice to have the amenities of a suite, so we could prepare our own meals some days. The staff was friendly and courteous (they even gave me an extra pillow on request!) and we would definitely stay there again.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown is a wonderful hotel. The hotel is very elegant, classy and only offers the best. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast, along with delicious meals and wines in the afternoons. The suites are very real designed and has a very upscale look. This wonderfully cozy yet graceful hotel leaves you with an experience of a lifeltime. I would recommend this awesome hotel to anyone that was looking for beautiful, yet comfortable hotel experience.
If you want the downtown experience of a lifetime, with historical living that will bring you back to Chicago in the early 1900's look no further, the dining experience is as comfortable as the stay, service is immaculate, and just as you think things couldn't get any better, you are only a walk away from one of the most exciting cities in America: Chicago with fine dining and a late night rendezvous as exciting as the nightlife, you are sure to have your excitement whims met, and walk away with the memory of a lifetime. Believe me I did. Valued Customer, Josh
This hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price! It has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses. We loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers. They also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner. The fitness center was very clean, I didn't want to leave it! Our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included! And I took advantage of the free grocery delivery. Beds are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated. But the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff. We will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago!
Very nice hotel, better than expected. The hot breakfast is great in the morning, but the Dinner at night goes above and beyond (even free wine!) The rooms are pretty good size, well furnished, and clean. I liked the view from my room. I used the fitness center and although did not have everything I would have liked, was adequate. I will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view. The staff was friendly and helpful; being my first time in Chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
From the moment I walked in I was impressed. The staff was very courteous and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was welcoming. The hotel was spacious and glamorous without looking overindulgent. My room was very nice and comfortable with a beautiful view and all everything I would need was in my kitchen. I found the pool and gym to be fantastic and I could truly relax during my stay. I will definitely book another stay at this hotel. 
To whom this may concern, my name is Jamie Brown, and i was a recent guest of yours between July 4th through July 10th, and your staff made my stay so comfortable i almost didnt want to leave. The Kitchen in the room and the complimentary grocery shopping service made me rethink leaving all together and when i didnt feel like cooking the complimentary welcome home dinner with a glass of wine, helped me clear my mind for all the paper work i had to look forward to. The free wireless internet access both in my room and sitting by the pool helped get all that done and helped me get my laps in as well. I really couldn't have asked for anything more! I felt like a queen and I never though I could feel that way just staying in a hotel. I thank you so very much for treating me so kindly and I will gladly be visiting you again very soon, only for more pleasure and way less business. Sincerely yours, Jamie Brown 
I would first like to say how inviting the rooms themselves are. For my wife and I, we enjoy the warmer colors. Cleanliness along with excellent staff, made me feel away from home yet relaxed. Being right Downtown was perfect for location. The suites are very quiet as well. I surprised my wife with the "Shopping Package". What a hit! Thanks Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown !!
My stay at the Hilton was like living in luxury for a few days. I never wanted to go back home much less leave the hotel. During my stay I could work out in their facility and swim at no added charge. In fact, they didn't charge for WIFI, morning breakfast or their grocery shopping service. The lobby always had complimentary coffee, tea, soda and meals! I felt like a queen. This hotel deserves highest marks for service. 
Upon entering Homewood Suites, I was greeted by incredibly friendly staff and my breath was taken by the beauty of the hotel. When I saw my room, I was immediately relieved because it provided all of the amenities needed for my week-long business stay (refrigerator, microwave, stove, dishwasher, flat panel TV). Best of all, the hotel has an on-site fitness center where I was able to work off all of the extra calories I consumed during the delicious complimentary breakfast. I couldn't resist their omelettes! The hotel is in the heart of Chicago and I must say, the city view from my room was priceless. Definitely recommended! 
I work for a software marketing firm, and that job requires me to travel at least 100 days per year. I spend a large amount of time in hotels. I normally don't write reviews for hotels, but the Homewood Suites by Hilton were above and beyond. Let's start where it matters: the rooms. They are top notch. There's nothing better than walking in to a clean, beautiful rooms after a long day of travel. The beds are among the best I've ever slept in in hotels. The rest of the room is just as nice and makes me feel at home. The price: Low. I looked for similar rooms in the area at other hotels, and everything else was at least 10% more expensive. But you don't get what you pay for here. You get much more than that! The location: Couldn't be better. You want to go to a world class restaurant? That's within walking distance. You want a great shopping experience? Again, walking distance. Anything else you want? Chances are, it's within walking distance. Overall, one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.
The Homewood Suites by Hilton, in downtown Chicago, has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city. After asking the doorman, I discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen. The full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take, as did the stove and LCD televisions. This is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in Chicago. It's mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as $40 a night, which is what I payed when I stayed there in September. The atmosphere was warm and cozy, and the staff were all very friendly and professional.
My stay at the Homewood Suites was absolutely one of my greatest stays away from home. The locations right in the heart of downtown Chicago. Within the River north shopping district.I love to shop so that was what i needed. Magnificent 2 room layouts with kitchen. The room was fully equipted with anything I needed,nice Flat screen along with a breakfast buffet and a fantastic complimentary dinner and wine. After dinner and wine I enjoyed the comfort of the heated indoor pool so relaxing. I would recommend these suites to everyone I know. 
First of all when you check in the check in process is smooth and takes no time at all, the front desk is very friendly and kind and make sure you know where your room is. Then on the way to your room they have spots with chairs and a table to have a seat and visit with other guest if you prefer to be out of you room. The room it's self is very spacious and clean. The pool area is very clean and neat and you always have a towel, they never seemed to run out. The service is beyond exceptional. I would recommend staying at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown to anyone.
Home away from home! The suites are amazing with great views of the city. The food is delious and served by an excellent staff. I loved the heated pool on the top floor, very relaxing after a long day of meetings. Great place to stay when your in Chicago!
Downtown Chicago has a multitude of available hotels. However once youve decided to step away from the ordinary a fantastic way to get away from it all is by booking a stay at the Homewood suites. The combination of luxury and affordability is evident as soon as youve entered the glamourous lobby. The Downtown Homewood suites is located near all the attractions which make Chicago the diverse and culturally rich town that is world known. The hotel offers a free fitness center, high speed wireless internet as well as a complimentary buffet breakfast. Being a member of the Hilton family ensures the utmost in quality and service which has been observed by millions of customers around the world. 
The Homewood Suites is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago! It is a great place to stay as a family. The last time my family and I visited Chicago, we stayed and picked the Shedd Aquarium package. What an amazing time! The Aquarium is great, and we saved a lot of money by buying this package. I also appreciated that fact that our room had a kitchen. With two really picky children, it was so nice to be able to cook, or at least to have the option. We also enjoyed the many neat facilities in the Homewood Suites Chicago Downtown. Nice pool, great workout room, breakfast buffet and the wine and beer dinner in the evening. I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I visit the Windy City!
I travel often and whenever I travel I prefer to stay at Hilton properties. I am always satisfied with my stay at Hilton. locations. However, I have never stayed at a Homewood Suites location. This property was awesome and it was great to have the same satisfication when I arrived. The lobby area was excellent and the greeting from the front desk staff was wonderful! My room was in great condition! Absolutely no complaints. I just figured that a property like this should be recognized. Great job staff!!!! I will definitely return in the future!
I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The separated living room and bedroom made it feel like I was renting a nice furnished apartment instead of a hotel room. The kitchen was a comfort since I could prepare a meal for myself if I wished, and the refrigerator and microwave was a must since I never finish my meals when I go out to eat. I felt more at ease here rather than the detatched feeling I have with most hotels. I would recommend staying at this hotel if you want to feel comfortable and welcome in a sophisticated atmosphere.
As a frequent traveler for both business and pleasure, clean and comfortable accommodations at a reasonable price are important to me. Homewood Suites Chicago provides all of that and more! The room was spacious and immaculately kept, with all the tools you could need to prepare a meal in the full-sized kitchen. After a busy work day, it was wonderful to be able to kick back in front of the huge flat-screen television to relax, with a spectacular backdrop of the city outside. I will definitely book a room next time in Chicago and I'll definitely continue to stay at Homewood Suites in other cities. 
My experience at the Hyatt Regency Chicago was simply amazing. I had a wonderful stay there will my husband. My husband has allergy problems nearly everywhere we go, and we were worried about that so we talked to the desk clerk there. They were able to provide us with a Hyatt allergy-friendly room. We were so relieved and the room was beautiful. The furniture in the room was actually cleaned with pure tea tree oil. It was the most comfortable stay we have ever had. On top of that my husband had to spend some time in the room working on some business, so the high speed internet they provided was very convenient. We took full advantage of the 24 hour room service. I will definitely stay there again. It is a vacation simply staying in your hotel room. 
The Hyatt Regency in Chicago was a wonderful experience for my husband and I as we traveled through the area on vacation. After checking in we simply relaxed in the beautiful atrium for a while before going to our room. To our delight the room was very clean, ultra-modern and furnished with sleek and comfortable furniture. What really impressed us about the room was how spacious it was and the stunning river front views. We were pressed for time to make dinner so decided the Bistro sounded like the best option and it turned out to be a great choice! The food was simply fabulous. After dinner we were able to try out the fitness center, which ended up making our gym at home seem inadequate. This was just what we needed as a restful base for our Chicago vacation and we will definitely stay here again.
The Hyatt Regency Chicago is a wonderful hotel. :) Me and my husband recently stayed there on a summer vacation, and it couldn't have been better! The staff was very polite and helpful, and the rooms were very clean, and they had some of the best beds I've ever slept on! Not to mention the view was amazing! If I had to rate this hotel I'd definitely give it five star, next time I'm in town I will most definitely stay there again!
My girlfriends and I stayed at the Hyatt in Chicago during a shopping trip to the city in June 2010. We found a great deal on Orbitz.com and decided to give it a try. The location was perfect, just off Michigan Avenue,on the Chicago River, so it was easy to walk down the Mag Mile and get to all of the shops without having to pay for cabs or rent a car. The hotel is right next the The Palm restaurant, and within walking distance of several places to eat, both fancy (China Grill, yum!)and affordable (Corner Bakery). The rooms have been recently remodeled and were clean and spacious. We were lucky to get a room with a good view...be sure to ask that you do not have a view of the office building next door! The lobby is typical Hyatt, big and spacious with lots of plants. Service was good. All around an excellent experience and a great deal.
The Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel is perfecty located in the center of downtown Chicago. Whether you are going there for business or pleasure, it is in the perfect place. The rooms are large and beautiful and the ball room took my breath away. The wi-fi connection was perfect for the work I needed to do and the show at the Navy Pier was perfect for when I needed a break. Other hotels have nothing on the Hyatt. I just wish there was a Hyatt Regency in every city for all of my business trips.
The Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel was a delight to stay at. I've never been to Chicago before, but the location was fantastic. They had all sorts of different rooms, from non-smoking to smoking to hypo-allergenic rooms. I've never seen so many options for rooms. The room I stayed in was well worth the nightly price. The location was so close to all the activities my husband and I had planned for our vacation. We have never been treated so much like royalty than at the Chicago Hyatt Regency.
From the moment I stepped into the hotel I felt like I was walking into my own castle and everyone was there to serve me. Checking in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly. I only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room, which I loved since I had just had quite a long flight, and made sure I had everything I needed before wishing me a happy stay in the Hyatt Regency Chicago. After settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant. Overall my experience was very positive and I would be glad to return to the Hyatt upon my next visit. 
Overall, the hotel is beautiful. The service was great. All the employees were friendly and always willing to help. My room on the North end had a great view of the city and the Chicago River. The bed and big fluffy pillows were very comfortable and relaxing. The only downfalls were parking and the fitness room. Parking was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be. The hotel itself is huge with over 1500 rooms, so you may feel like your getting your daily exercise in just walking from your room to the fitness center depending on where your room is located. 
Quite simply the Hyatt Regency Chicago is the business traveler's best friend. Recently I had to attend a seminar in Chicago and stayed at the Hyatt. To say I was impressed would be an understatement. Centrally located in the heart of downtown, the Hyatt has perfected the art of ultimate guest satisfaction. On arrival the staff goes into overdrive. They make you feel like you are the only guest in this huge hotel. The rooms are very big and elegantly furnished with 100 percent cotton linens. My room came equipped with flat screen tv, wi-fi and high speed internet. Room service was quite extensive and if it was not on the menu they went out of their way to accomodate you. There were also car rental on site as were restaurants, cocktail bar and a 24 hour dining room. They have state of the art conference rooms with high tech features. There is also catering and limo service. The staff is multilingual and the concierge service is very professional. All in all they will pamper you from head to toe and other parts in between. This hotel is definitely worth the price and I will definitely return not as a business traveler but as a tourist who wants to be pampered. My only regret? That I could not stay much longer. 
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Chicago. My stay here was wonderful thanks to such a friendly staff. I needed to do some research for work and the free Wi-Fi made this very easy. The bed was so nice and soft! Even the pillows were fluffy. I was able to put my valuables in the in-room safe. The local restaurants were amazing. I will recommend this to my friends and I am staying here again in the future.
I never thought I'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home. I am a mother of two children, one of which has severe asthma and allergies. I have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years. So when my sister was getting married in Chicago, I was extremely anxious. The front desk associate, Rosa, was wonderful. She told me that they have Allergy friendly rooms. No perfumes, no harsh cleaning chemicals, no dreaded "industry standard" feather pillows. I booked a room, but was still really worried. I shouldn't have been. Ethan breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home. Maybe even a little better. They had an air purification system for our room. It smelled so fresh! While my husband took our daughter to the Big Bar for Nachos (she never stopped talking about how "totally cool" it was), I ordered room service for my son. The man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating. My son has a lot of food allergies, so I was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details. That's always a little humbling, but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time. I was actually able to enjoy my sister's wedding. The only problem with my stay is that it was too short. We're coming back for our first family vacation since Ethan was born. Thank you, Hyatt Regency Chicago, for making this family's visit possible and positive!!
My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago to celebrate our ten year anniversary. We could not have picked a better locate. The price of the hotel was really affordable for a couple on a tight budget. The flat screen television and the comfortable beds were a favorite of mine. My husband loved the Stetson Steakhouse and the 24 hour stay fit gym. We really did not leave the hotel during I stay there because basically everything you need is only a walk or phone call away. If we ever travel to this area again this would be my first and only pick for a wonderful stay. This hotel gets four thumbs up from my husband and I. What a wonderful ten years celebration.
My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency while attending a family wedding in Chicago. From the moment we entered the beautiful lobby we were treated as if we were returning friends. Our rooms were ready upon arrival, and they were just as impressive as when I viewed them online. The location couldn't be more convenient to access all of Chicago's shopping and dining areas. We dined in Seston's Chop House, which I highly recommend. The staff at the hotel are professionals who work to make your stay there a grand experience. The Hyatt Regency Chicago is the only place we will stay when we return to the Windy City!
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for business, but extended my stay through the weekend because i loved it! The accommodations exceeded my expectations. My bed was very comfortable, the room was big enough, and the shower was so relaxing. I had a great meal in the chop shop and the coffee was delicious at J's express. The fitness center was clean, and inspiring. I will recommend this hotel to others while in the area. 
Great hotel with beautiful scenery! The staff was wonderful and the rooms were comfortable and spacious. They even had a docking station for my iPod! 
I went to Chicago on business last year and I had the pleasure of staying at the luxurious Hyatt Regency Hotel. I opted for the Business Plan, although they have many different room descriptions available to choose from, such as the Allergy Friendly, Monarch Suite, State Suite, all the way up to the Presidential Suite. My suite was a perfect blend of business and comfort, equipped with Wi-Fi, a generous 37 inch television, spacious work area and two queen sized beds you sink into feeling tension ease from your body. I dined at the Stetson's Chop Shop restaurant and the meal was portioned generously and very well prepared. The staff was curtious and accommodating. For breakfast, I opted to have my meal brought to my room where I started my business day over a delicious hot meal and strong, gourmet coffee. I would highly recommend this wonderful haven to anyone planning an overnight Chicago stay.
Great hotel!! The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was in perfect shape, very clean and just a beautiful setup. I will definetly go to this hotel many more times when i am in the area! I would definetly recommend it!
The Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel offered PDA or kiosk check-in which was great. They also offer hypo-allergenic rooms with air purification systems which gave us a much more delightful stay. We enjoyed the 24/7 stay fit gym, iHome stereo with iPod docking station, flat screen tv with video on demand and Wi-Fi. Concierge staff was very helpful with assisting us with finding excellent award winning dining and popular attractions in the area. We enjoyed our stay and will definetly return to this hotel in the future for family and business trips.
The Hyatt Regency Chicago is one of the most beautiful hotels that I have ever stayed at. I stayed there for 3 days and two nights. My room had an amazing view and was clean and furnished beautifully. The staff was very kind and very helpful. The concierge staff was kind and helped me to find enjoyable things to do in Chicago. Overall, A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city.
Recently, I traveled to Chicago for a business conference and was lucky enough to stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. The whole experience was wonderful! The room was spacious and beautiful, and the bed was so comfortable that I had no problem falling asleep, as I normally do at other hotels. The staff were polite and courteous, and after a delicious breakfast in the restaurant, I went to my conference with a smile on my face.
Recently I traveled to Chicago for business. I was treated to a stay at the InterContinental Chicago by my employer. It truly says something about your company when they are willing to go the extra mile to make time away from family and friends as comfortable and as relaxing as possible for you. I was greeted by a series of smiling faces that were employed at the hotel and all were eager to help. I checked in at the amazingly lavish lobby and was escorted by hotel staff who assisted me with my bags up to my room. My room was dripping with taste. The stylish room was only made more accommodating by the amenities it offered. With a mini-bar, large flat-screen television, and an entire home office setup, I barely had to leave the room. Why would I want to with the amazing views of the lake and entire city. What an amazing experience I had and I will gladly come back.
At the InterContinental Chicago, you pay for more than a room. You pay for an experience. Let me elaborate. I was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. Like any novice traveller to Chicago, I saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs, and those were originally what I set my sights on. Price is a powerful signal, and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. But after doing a bit of research, I realised that distance does have its costs. The price of transit in the Chicagoland area isn't free. And it's far from what I'm used to. Car use is price prohibitive. (I knew that originally, which is why I wasn't going to drive.) But the sting of using the automobile (parking, congestion, toll roads, etc.) gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. So, I ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. But mass transit has its costs too, which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. That's what originally drew me to InterContinental. But InterContinental is much more than the right room at the right place. The decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. I was travelling on international business, so the ease with which I could transact in foreign currency was a draw. (They had a currency exchange right there on the premises.) And the fact that massages, dry cleaning, and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. My work gets me tied up in knots. It also leaves little time for doing chores. So the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. But, on top of all that, the event planning was what put InterContinental over the top. Being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of Chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something I won't forget. In the end, if you're a newcomer to Chicago staying in a time-crunch, the InterContinental is for you. The pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive, but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs, it's nothing in the end. And the InterContinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options, it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be.
Last month, my husband and I stayed at the InterContinental Chicago while we were in town for IMTS. Although they were very busy, the service was excellent and very professional. The staff were always smiling and happy to help. InterContinental was conveniently located near Michigan avenue, and the best stores and restaurants in town. The view from our room was great! Our room was always clean when we arrived home at night, it was decorated nicely, and the beds were extremely comfortable! We ate at the hotel's restaurant Zest, and the food was great! It was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while. We will definitely be back!
My husband and I visited this hotel on our way home from our honeymoon. It's a very nice hotel, but the valet parking is very expensive, $53.00 per night was rather high so we opted to park our own car. The pool was very nice, and the water was warm. The front desk was very nice and helpful, If I ever visited Chicago again I would stay there.
The InterContinental Chicago is conveniently located near MIdway airport so the commute was short and easy. The room had a great view of a lake. Room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great I did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee. There was a business center that had internet, fax machines, and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day. One of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs, it was exactly what I needed, very relaxing. The food at the Eno was some of the best I ever ate especially the chocolate, I never wanted to leave. This was a great hotel experience and I would stay there again.
The Inter Continental is a great hotel. The staff was very friendly, and the accomidations were great. The room was clean and ready on time, and the indoor swimming pool was perfect considering Chicago's weather. Eno was simply AMAZING. Their wine selection is second to none. And the Turkey Pumpkin Curry at Zest was to die for.
The InterContinental hotel is truly a hidden treasure. Nestled deep in sky scraping steel epicenter of downtown Chicago, the hotel is a taste of both modern day luxury and old time charm. From the tiled indoor pool surrounded by high Romanesque arching ceilings to the rich mahogany furniture and lace curtains in the suites, the InterContinental was built to satisfy the taste of even the most hardened traveler. Book well in advance as it is one of the most sought after retreats in all of Chicago.
This is a review of a first class hotel the InterContinental Chicago. It's located on Chicago's famous magnificent mile near restaurants, shopping, entertainment, and historic landmarks. The service at the hotel is first class and the accommodations are unbeatable. The hotel also features really fabulous amenities including a nice indoor swimming pool, fine dining, a 24 hour business center, and valet parking. This is a extra ordinary luxury hotel that will make your stay in Chicago a joy. They offer a number of options on the rate and have a selection of package deals available. Visit their website for a photo gallery and a virtual tour. 
I am so glad I decided to stay at the Intercontinental Chicago for my first trip to the city. The staff is very attentive, I felt like I was the only person they had to take care of! The location is great, right on the Magnificent Mile and so close to major attractions. My suite was well appointed and very clean. I even looked behind some furniture for dust and couldn't find any. The hotel is very luxurious. The sheets and towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable. The next time I travel to Chicago, I will definitely stay at the Intercontinental again.
 We just returned from a relaxing stay at the InterContinental in Chicago. I have to say the service was phenomenal! From the maid to the concierge and everyone in between, the staff treated us like royalty. It was quite the treat to feel so special. Our room was gorgeous. The view of the city was breathtaking. The luxury mattress and bedding made for the most comfortable peaceful slumber. We found the marble bathroom stunning and impeccably clean. My wife was very pleased with the lighted make-up mirror while I enjoyed the reliable Wi-Fi connection. During our stay we dinned in the Zest. Wow! They offer an extensive wine menu and a full array of gourmet food options. We had to try the famous wiener schnitzel -- it was scrumptious. Afterwards, my wife and I shared the chocolate lava cake, can I just say oh that cake is to die for! Really the best we ever had. In the morning we spent some time working off dinner at the junior olympic swimming pool; followed by an exhilarating round of cardio in the hotels dedicated cardio room. Afterwards, a trip to the sauna was a well deserved refuge. Overall, our stay at the InterContinental in Chicago was nothing short of fabulous. This luxury hotel is complete with the finest of amenities and the most caring staff. We are looking forward to staying at the InterContinental again, hopeful soon! 
This is a great place to stay while visiting Chicago. My husband and I went over the holidays to see my family and we stayed at this hotel. We could not have asked for nicer people! Everyone was always smiling and very helpfull! We usually stay at the Ramada...but will never stay anywhere other than the InterContinental Chicago hotel again! - Casey L. Skinner
Wow! I have been to many hotels as a business man, and have seen my fair share of garbage dump hotels. But wow, this hotel was great. The staff was prompt, the room was extremely clean, and everything just ran like a well-oiled machine. I was particularly impressed with the fact that the front desk gives out free toiletries and other things. Usually I have to pay 5$ for a stupid toothbrush, but not here! I really enjoyed staying at InterContintental. I was very worried about the Chicago area's reputation of bad hotels, but this turned out just great. Next time my boss flies me out to Chicago, I know where I am staying! 
This hotel is in a great city with great personnel working there. The rooms are more than you can expect for a hotel. The services are abundant, leaving no room to complain. With their fine diners, you cannot go wrong with enjoying a peaceful meal while relaxing. With this hotel, it is truly an all-in-one hotel. There are meeting rooms and business centers, leaving unfinished work not be a worry during the stay. In addition, the spacious swimming pool is just the thing needed to relieve yourself of stress. The views from the rooms are breathtaking. I would definitely recommend staying there!
Very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view. The dinning selection is one of the best I have seen in Chicago. I have stayed many places downtown Chicago and nothing matches this. I am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well. The shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors. The biggest thing that I have to say is that the Customer service was great with everything that I needed. I give the hotel a 5 out of 5.
The InterContinental Chicago is located in the heart of Downtown Chicago, Illinois on North Michigan Avenue, the Magnificent Mile. This hotel is located within moments, not minutes, from the Navy Pier, Millennium Park, and Magnificent Mile Shopping. The InterContinental Chicago boasts a modern fitness center that feature free weights, a cardio room, dry saunas, as well as, masseurs. When business knocks at your door, the hotel has a 24 hour business center providing high-speed internet access, fax, and photocopying services. The accommodations at the InterContinental Chicago are elegant with a touch of historic decor. The room had a breath-taking view of Chicago, as well as, had an in-room mini-bar, terry-cloth bath robes, over-sized desks, high-speed internet access, and a 37-inch Hi Def LCD Television. Not only was the overall quality of the property in stunning condition, the staff at the InterContinental Chicago were welcoming, caring, and demonstrated a profound customer-service base.
The InterContinental Chicago Hotel is absolutely magnificent. The rooms are of utmost standard and you get treated with such respect. The staff is always there no matter what. Not only is the hotel beautiful but it surrounded by beautiful lights and beautiful skyscrapers. I give it two dumbs up. If you are ever in Chicago the InterContinental Chicago is the place to stay.
The InterContinental Chicago Hotel is one of the finest hotels I have stayed at in a long time. The atmosphere upon arrival was one of elegance and beauty. The staff welcomed us and catered to our every need. The rooms were plush and very romantic. Interior decor was breathtaking. It is definitely above a 4 star rating and I would not think twice about coming back here. It received my highest recommendation.
This hotel is absolutely beautiful. I is elegant, comfortable and a very relaxing stay. It was easy to get to the airport and very close to shopping. I felt like a king in a castle surrounded by luxury and beauty. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
My family's seven day stay at the InterContinental Chicago hotel was more than I could ever imagine. The InterContinental is more fantastic than any previous hotel I have visited, because of its wonderful amenities, such as the excellent 24 hour room service, access to personal trainers,and even a dry cleaning service, just to mention a few. My family really enjoyed dining on the contemporary American cuisine at the hotels Zest Restaurant, which served an excellent meal worth every dime of its reasonable price. My most favorite point about the InterContinental Chicago is that it provides entry right into the Windy City, where my family and I had immediate access to transportation, shopping, and city attractions. We had a great time traveling through Chicago and enjoying ourselves while at the same time we felt secure knowing that we had a nice, clean, elegant, safe hotel to travel back to whenever we were done touring the city each day. The InterContinental is a must stay and I will recommend them to anyone who plans on visiting Chicago.
I was going to Chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops. I did some research and believed the InterContinental would suit my needs. I sure was not disappointed by my decision! This hotel lots of historic charm. Despite being a larger hotel, the service was top shelf! The rooms, while not large by any means, were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable. My kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered. As for me, I was more impressed with the location to the Magnificent Mile. The hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site. The food was very good and, just like the hotel itself, the restaurant provided perfect customer service. Dollar for dollar, the InterContinental in Chicago is a great deal and I will be staying there again. 
Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. I chose it largely for location as I don't really love to walk that much and I was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city. It was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and I mainly ventured out for food, of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help. We had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk. Everyone was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again. Our room was amazing. Seriously amazing. It was so chic and I just loved the headboard over our bed. There wasn't one little spot of dust to be found. The bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet. We didn't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious. We had dinner at David Burke's Primehouse. I cannot recommend the NY Ribeye more highly. It was fantastic. For dessert we had the brown butter corn cake. I've been trying to replicate that dish ever since I got home. I'm sad to say that I didn't get a chance to try any of the treatments at Spa by Asha but I definitely will make a point to on my return visit. The James Chicago made our trip to Chicago memorable. The staff was friendly, the hotel beautiful, and the food delicious. What more could you want?
I've stayed at several different hotels in Chicago but The James is the best. Everything I need is in walking distance and I find it very convenient to stay there. The staff at the concierge desk is so polite and offers assistance willingly. The room has always been very clean. The bed linens are better that the nice sheets I have on my own bed. Thankfully I don't have to search around for somewhere to stay when I travel there as I've found my favorite.
This is one of the best hotels I have ever been in. I went there to see about scheduling my reception party, and was amazed at the architecture of the building, the interior design of the rooms, and the massive spacing provided for each room. Now I recommend this hotel to my associates to hold their important business meetings in the James Club, so that after the meetings, we can partake in a nice meal and drinks. Which brings me to my next point. The James has some of the BEST food I have ever eaten!!! The James Private Club, I feel was made for the elite and upper class. Very classy, very elegant. The customer service is outstanding. I recommend this hotel to anyone needing to hold a reception, business meeting, or just need to have a day at the spa. 5 stars all the way!!! 
I stayed in on of The James one bedroom apartments for two weeks while in Chicago visiting my daughter. The pre-arrival assistant was incredibly helpful in acquiring some necessities I forgot to pack and left them in my room for me. Later in the week I treated myself to an Asha Massage from their lengthy list of delicious spa services. Afterward I smelled wonderful and was the most relaxed I'd been in years. My room was clean and modern, yet warm and comforting with dark wood tones and lush bedding. I'll certainly be staying with them again in the future. 
We decided to stay at The James last weekend with our kids. We reserved the "Family Adventurer with Paul Frank". It's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium. We ended up receiving 2 Chicago City Passes, which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the Chicago Children's Museum. My kids had a ball. We ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored. All in all, a great weekend where my kids were the focus. The adults certainly weren't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning. 
My stay at the James Hotel in Chicago was fantastic! The hotel was clean, modern and everything I had hoped for. The staff was fabulous and went above and beyond all of our expectations. All of our needs were more than met and I will be recommending this hotel to all of our friends and associates.
Do you want to stay in a sleek modern hotel that gives you all of the amenities to conduct your business? Then the James Hotel in Chicago is the place for you. Superb clean lines and sophistication welcomes you on first sight. Followed by spacious rooms, luxurious linens, and all-natural Kiehl's body shampoos and lotions. I absolutely loved my stay at the James Hotel in downtown Chicago. The bathrooms have raised sinks, and all of the luxurious amenities you would want. I absolutely loved the natural wood feel mingled with a modern touch. I felt at home in a very clean and modern atmosphere. I definitely would stay again, and plan to stay at the James in New York as well 
This was really an unexpected experience for me as far as hotel accommodations go. For this week's vacation in Chicago, I heard several recommendations regarding lodging, but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically. I expected an experience of comfort, luxury and customer satisfaction, but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel. The design is breathtaking -- modern, clean, stylish, sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby, shops and restaurants, to the stunning guest rooms themselves. My family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in, and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor. Far from a traditional hotel experience, this was like moving into chic, exclusive downtown apartment, and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living. Impressive, too, was the hotel's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world's resources. From its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage, the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world, and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance. It's a respect that shows through, too, in other areas: support for artistic organizations, charities and other programs of merit, as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay, whether for a weekend, a week, or longer. The James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago. In fact, we may visit again solely to stay at the James! 
Just what I needed at James: I can't tell you how impressed I was with my stay at the James Chicago Hotel. I came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the James by a friend. The crisp, clean, contemporary ambiance made me feel like I was on a relaxed vacation rather than work. It was luxury without being over the top. My room was clean, comfortable and was above all standards comfortable. In my down time I enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the "JBar", and I highly recommend dinner at the "David Burke Primehouse" The customer service from all the staff members, from front desk, to house keeping to the bartender was excellent. I plan on returning on my spring vist and look forward to another phenomenal experience. 
I had a wonderful time at the James Hotel while on business in Chicago. The rooms are modern, tasteful and well-kept, while the staff was responsive and efficient. This was the perfect place to unwind after working all day, but also provided an ideal atmosphere to do some more work. 
Recently my husband and I stayed at The James in Chicago for our "night on the town". After taking in a musical, we checked in at The James and were happily surprised with the customer appreciation and delicious room service. The rooms were spotless and we were supplied with fresh towels for everything from showers to the spa to visiting the gym. If I had known that they accepted pets beforehand, it would've been a great environment for our family lapdog. Staying at The James in Chicago made our night a luxurious outing and will be a definite stop next time we are in Chicago.
I am often traveling on business and I always try to stay at the James. The modern design of the lobby and restaurant with wood and glass creates a luxurious atmosphere and the streamlined, comfortable room design give an upscale aesthetic like that of a penthouse loft apartment. The availability of computers and coffee in the James' business centers means I do not have to lug my laptop around the hotel. The James provides the perfect setting for business travelers and is a cozy place to retire to in the evenings. The ease of breakfast service in the rooms means that I do not have to stress or rush, as my time is valuable. I love the James.
The James Chicago Hotel is located right in the heart of the one and only, downtown Chicago. This wonderful hotel has many classy and down to earth boutique's, and the views are breath-taking. The hotel just has a warm feeling to it, and the hotel staff is more than excellent. This hotel is situated right across from the Magnificent Mile, and only minutes away from the world famous shopping, dining, and fun for all ages. The James is modern and luxurious. The James is definately a hotel that I would recommend and will go back to in years to come. 
Our stay at the James in late last August exceeded our expectations. My husband was in Chicago for a business trip, and I tagged along to have some time away from our day to day life. When we entered the hotel we were greeted acknowledged the minute we walked through the doors, and the staff member at the front desk was extremely friendly. He met our needs in a timely manner and patiently answered our questions. The lobby was clean and the ambiance was impressive. Our room was also very clean. I could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet. The bed was comfortable, and the bedding was the type you could slip into and drift off in. It has been awhile since I have stayed at a hotel where the comforter was not scratchy or too thin. My husband actually commented that he had not seen me sleep that soundly in over a month. The bathroom was also impressive. The water pressure was not something I had to mess with to get perfect, and the heater took no time at all to warm up. Even though I had brought my own shampoo and conditioner, I did give the amenities in the bathroom a try, and like everything else they exceeded my expectations. I did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms, however, my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities. I truly enjoyed the location and ambiance of this hotel, and if we are ever in the Chicago area again we will definitely be staying here. This hotel met all of our needs from relaxation to business to pleasure. 
This hotel is great! I love its interior design of the room. Customer service is excellent! And its gym and spa are gorgeous. If you need to go to Chicago, this hotel would be your best choice! You can also check its website for the special offer, I found a great deal on it! 
the James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. The room service is the best in the area, not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for. The lobby and the reception area is very contemporary. This is a great place to take the family to relax. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 5 stars! 
This is a beautiful hotel inside and outside. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The hotel made my experience of visiting this city even more wonderful, I highly recommend this to anyone. 
My husband and I stayed at the James Chicago Hotel for our anniversary. This place is fantastic! We knew as soon as we arrived we made the right choice! The rooms are BEAUTIFUL and the staff very attentive and wonderful!! The area of the hotel is great, since I love to shop I couldn't ask for more!! We will definatly be back to Chicago and we will for sure be back to the James Chicago. Betsy M, Louisville, KY 
We enjoyed our stay at the James in Chicago very much. The hotel is elegant and uber-modern! Each room simply exudes class. I have never stayed in a nicer hotel, to be honest. The hotel features an upscale restaurant, though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments. There is also a full-service spa at the hotel. The most surprising thing about the James is that pets are allowed; our dog didn't have to stay at home. How cool is that? There are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking, 24-hour room service, 24-hour concierge, shoe shine service, and laundry/dry cleaning. The hotel is located right on the Magnificent Mile, so that location is absolutely superb. You are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world. I would recommend the James to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to Chicago. 
Great hotel! Went to see the Museum of Contemporary Art which was great, but this hotel almost had it beat! The rooms (and even halls) are very beautifully done. Great service too. A+
My company was hosting a seminar at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago, IL. Each participant of the seminar stayed in one of the luxurious rooms at the hotel. My room had an incredible view of downtown Chicago and the styles of the rooms were very modern. My husband was able to stay back in the room and enjoy the large flat screen television while I attended the seminar in one of the hotels meeting rooms. On Saturday night, my company held a ball in the Crystal Ballroom. The food was excellent, the hotel chefs were the best. The servers were polite and were right there to fill up our drinks or bring us more food at the dinner. Our overall stay at Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel will be forever in my memory. It was a fun filled weekend with great food, clean rooms, excellent maid service and all the hotel personnel were polite and willing to fulfill our every need and want! We will definitely be staying here again! 
It was my first time to visit Chicago and I would say, i'd definitely go back, not just because of the Air and Water Show that we really enjoyed, but most importantly, because of the hotel that we stayed in. The Millennium Knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests, but with pets too. At first I was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog, but I was surprised it turned out the other way. I've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that's really frustrating, it's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit Chicago. 
I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a fun weekend in Chicago. The standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable. I love a hotel with all white sheets because then I know it's clean. I really liked the simple and modern decor, especially the huge upholstered headboard. Nice fixtures in the bathroom and granite counter. The bathroom was so much nicer than my own bathroom at home. The staff was friendly. Can't really judge the service because I didn't have any problems or complaints. So I didn't have a reason to interact with the staff much. Overall, it was a very nice hotel in a great location. Will definitely stay here again on my next visit.
This hotel was incredible! Haven't had a better stay in a hotel in my life. I will definitely come here again next time I am in Chicago! The rooms were so elegant, with their modern color schemes. The staff members were friendly and willing to lend a hand. The beds were surprisingly comfortable, with interesting covers. The TVs were HD, which was a step up from most hotels i have stayed at before. There was a cool martini bar that I spent an hour at one night, which was enjoyable, especially because of the live jazz band
I stayed here in the last weekend of September 2010 for the Bears vs Packers Monday Night game. My room rocked! I had a pretty big flat screen, and a super soft bed. The room was clean and stylish, and the staff was very courteous from check-in to check-out. My favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home. I definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax.
I just spent a week at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel and it was a very plesant stay. When I first walked into the room it was very clean. The bathroom was a decent size and the decorum was pleasant. Room service was very good. The view was amazing and I would recomend staying there.
I wouldn't know how to begin to write something negative about the Millenium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago. Everything about this hotel is fantastic from the outside of the building to the hotel lobby all the way to the rooms. With very clean and plush rooms, this is the place to stay! When you are not at the hotel eating at the elegant dining area or having a great breakfast first thing in the morning, there is plenty to do around the town. Take a shopping spree down Michigan Ave or head to one of the museums or the pier to look around. Whatever you decide to do, you can't go wrong. This place is wonderful!
I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a total of three days, and through out my stay I had a wonderful time. The room was impeccably clean, as well as the pillows and sheets. The beds were large and extremely comfortable. The staff though, in my honest opinion, is what made my stay so pleasant. From the people at the check in, to the waiters at the restaurant, I got the best customer service. The hotel was also conveniently located. It was within walking distance to the shopping center. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in Chicago. 
This hotel was worth every cent. You have not experienced Chicago luxury until you have stayed here. In town for a conference, my colleagues and I never had to leave our hotel for much of anything. Fine dining, entertainment, you name it: Knickerbocker's got it! I will definitely return as my wife and I frequent Chicago to visit family.
First let me say wonderful!! My wife and i were refered this Hotel by a friend. After traveling to Chicago many time we have had many experiences good and bad with different hotels. We were amazed with the Knickerbocker, we felt like royalty from our first step on the property. Everyone was willing to make our stay rememberable. This Hotel made a routine trip to Chicago a dream Vacation. I can not wait to return...
The Knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit. My wife and I utilized the park & play package, which gave us an amazing room, complimentary valet service, and a great kit to plan our weekend around. It was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again. The rooms were top notch and the hotel's staff was excellent. One of the employees, Craig, helped us find our way around the city and this shows the Knickerbocker really cares about its guests. We loved our visit and are sure you will too. A+
We stayed at the beautiful Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel located in scenic downtown Chicago. It was close to shopping, local attractions like the Shedd Aquarium and even the Navy Pier. The hotels featured luxurious amenities like a ball room and in room massages, which I took advantage of as any woman (or man) should! A continental breakfast is available for a nominal fee, unless purchased with a package deal, in their own upscale restaurant, Nix! We would definitely book a suite there again and highly recommend this hotel to all our friends and family!
I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Chicago back in September and we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel. The place was absolutely oozing with old-fashioned charm! Also, there were plenty of shopping opportunities within walking distance, so I shopped while my husband worked. It just doesn't get any better than that! I loved the service we received and the ambiance of that grand old hotel, and I'd definitely stay there again!
When you enter the lobby at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered. The staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can. The check in process is smooth and friendly as I expected. When you enter your room the decor catches your eye. Luxurious yet not stuffy is how I describe it. The restroom tub is large and made of marble. The whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home. I highly recommend The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while.
This hotel is the best hotel ever in my opinion, and I really enjoy everything thing about it and I also have many different reasons why I like this hotel. From the entrance to every details on the inside all the way up to the rooms, everything seems to pocess some kind of style to it and not forgetting such a modern feel it has. I completely am astonished by this building and if I had to pick one to compare with this one I really would go for this one. It's like a person would have to see it to believe. It has a lot of modern designs. Thank you and this is my review and it's real. 
I enjoyed a pleasant 2 night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago, Il. The hotel was beautiful, inside and out. I felt as if I was a celebrity staying there. The staff was especially kind and very professional. My husband and I have never felt more comfortable. I was very pleased that they had transportation for us, since we flew in to Chicago for our anniversary. The Shedd Aquarium package was an excellent bonus. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone that's going to be visiting Chicago!
My family really enjoyed this hotel the weekend we were in Chicago. Check in was quick and easy the staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable and we had a great view of Chicago. Next time we come to Chicago we will definitely stay here again.
The entrance and room was spacious and modern, yet elegant. It was very easy to get around to many places because it is in the middle of all the action of Chicago. The drinks were very exotic and tickled the taste buds. Indeed, it is one of the best vacation or weekend getaway spots. 
I stayed at the millennium Knickerbocker for 3 nights while on a business trip, as it was conveniently located a few blocks away from the office I was visiting, and just about everything else for that matter. The lobby was absolutely beautiful, and the staff was beyond courteous and extremely helpful. The rooms were elegant and spacious, and I instantly felt right at home. The large flat screen TV as a nice touch and TV options were many. I headed downstairs to the bar for a drink, and was amazed at how well kept it was, as well as how nice everybody was. As this was my first time I asked the bartender about the area around and he gave me great advice about some places to check out. All in all this was a great experience, and next time I'm in the area, I will definitely be staying here. I'd recommend the Millennium Knickerbocker to anyone traveling to Chicago.
We stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker last week and it was really wonderful. First off, the staff is excellent. All of our needs were addressed quickly and with a smile. The hotel really was the perfect launching pad for us to take in everything that Chicago has to offer. All of the shopping of Michigan Avenue was just steps from our room. We decided to go for the Shedd Aquarium package. We started the day with a really wonderful breakfast at the hotel and then thoroughly enjoyed our "all access pass" to the aquarium (very cool!). After our long days of sightseeing (and a quick stop at the wonderful martini bar), it was so nice to come back to the room which was elegant, but a very comfortable sanctuary from the busy city. To top it all off, they have the most incredible shower that I've ever used (and, even better, it's all "green"). What more can I say? The Millennium Knickerbocker was a huge part of what made our vacation so wonderful and memorable. I highly recommend it!
Hotel Monaco is a luxurious hotel situated in the heart of Chicago. It is blooming with historical elegance combined with modern day amenities. I had the pleasant experience of staying at this facility. Perfectly set up to handle any business traveler, sight seer, convention, wedding or shopper. They offer top notch service from reservations to wedding planning or even asking for a good local restaurant. I noticed that world travelers are welcome here with some of the employees ability to speak foreign languages. Guest rooms offer stylish charm and can relax even the unrelaxable. In room spa's and top notch room service is second to none. The South Water Kitchen is a true downtown Chicago restaurant offering mid-west American dishes and several signature cocktails. I know that anytime I visit Chicago, Hotel Monaco is my place to be. 
I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and I must say, it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city. In the past, I've always stayed at the Marriott or the Hilton so this time I thought I'd go with a boutique hotel. I've stayed at some of the Kimpton properties in San Francisco so I was delighted that they are running the Monaco. Basically, I like the friendly, real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places I've used before. I do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill I normally use. South Water Kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants. I really dug the complimentary coffee, high speed internet and newspaper. I get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the Monaco offered a bunch of freebies -- especially liked the afternoon wine service. All in all, I will return to the Monaco. It's a great alternative.
Hotel Monaco is simply amazing. I travel quite a bit, and am use to generic hotels, with horribly unimpressive rooms, and "5 star amenities" which usually mean a packet of instant coffee, and room service that won't serve after 9pm. Hotel Monaco on the other hand was very impressive. The suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy. This hotel has such personality. My absolute favorite part of my stay, aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs, was the in-room spa treatment. Hotel Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me. Generic just won't do anymore.
You made Chicago a wonderful stay! The room was gorgeous! I came with very little on hand and my deluxe room supplied me with everything that I needed, I didn't even have to ask! Thank you so much, I will be back! Very tidy room as well!
I stayed at the monaco for the Labor day weekend when I visited my family in Chicago. It is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in my life. clean, comfortable and pretty. The rooms were clean and the staff is very caring. I needed some more glasses as my family was sharing drink. The front desk had them sent up in less than 10 minutes. I will recommend Monaco to anyone who will be staying in the Chicago area. 
I have heard friends talking about the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and did have my doubts at first. However when I arrived there was amazed at the location! It is near so many shopping places, museums, theatre, and many others places. Was in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long, however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire 6 day stay. Fell asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day! The staff at the place is amazing I even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people. One day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best I have ever had at a hotel. All and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room, good service, and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby, will be heading back to this hotel many times.
The Hotel Monaco Chicago was a great hotel. The rooms were very nice, great customer service. Every member of the staff was extremely nice. I liked that it was pet friendly, and you couldn't even tell they allowed pets. Very clean. Prompt service when requested, and the food was very tasty! An A+ in my book, the prices were very reasonable as well since it is a four star hotel. Very immaculate. Will definitely stay there again the next time I visit Chicago.
This is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the Chicago River and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city! I had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in-room massage and fantastic room service. If you're looking for a vacation in Chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort, I highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely come again!
This was a great hotel, one of the nicest that we have stayed in a long time. My wife was absolutely thrilled with the staff and we couldn't believe the KimptonKids program at the site. We will be back next time we stop in town. We cannot think of a better place to stay. 
Fantastic stay! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference. Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm. Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door. They are the best I've ever had. EVER! If youre in the mood to unwind, you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around. I had a great time here. From now on, I won't stay anyplace else. 
Upon entering the Hotel Monaco CHicago, i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building. The old fashioned furnishings, the wonderful view, and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel. At first i had been skeptical, but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone. As i entered my room, the fresh flowers and the amazing Chicago view greeted me. During my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool, winding down every night with a comforting massage. I would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance, but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities. 
This will be the only hotel I will never forget in my life. Hotel Monaco Chicago has the best staff and also the rooms are also nice. Whether if it's a King Delux Room or a Tranquility Suite, all of the rooms are luxorious and are themed based, so it suits ones personality. Even if you are a super sized person, like me with a height of 6"4', there are special "Tall Rooms" just for you. My days went very fast when I stayed there becuase there was so much to do there. In the mornings I would do yoga from the Yoga Channel. Then I would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper. Before I go to a meeting, I would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service. After I come back from the meeting, I would go to their fitness rooms and workout on their fully-equipped machines. I just didn't want to leave that hotel; so I decided that the next time I come to Chicago, I will surely stay at Hotel Monaco Chicago.
Our experience at Hotel Monaco was wonderful. My fiancee and I stayed two nights in the Tranquility suite--absolutely exquisite! We had wonderful room service and practically never had to leave our room. (Except to go to the gym :) I was able to do yoga on the trip because they had yoga accessories in the room! I was surprised by that. This hotel was the definition of 'luxury', they had anything we needed and more. My fiancee said we were staying at a really 'nice' hotel but I had no idea until we walked in the door. As soon as you walk in you are met with the charming atmosphere and luxurious decor. I have to admit, cheesy as it may sound, I felt like a queen all weekend long :) Most of the time I have at least one problem with the hotel I stayed at, but I have to say at this point I have no complaints at all about Hotel Monaco and I will definitely look forward to staying there again during my next trip to Chicago.
My stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago was amazing. The staff are polite and well poised, eager to give a helping hand in a short notice. To someone like me, who had never even been in the city of Chicago, it really gave me a good feeling throughout my whole trip. The rooms, hallways and facilities were exceptionally clean and tidy, and whenver I went out, I would always find my room perfect ; be it for a night of undwinding after one of my conferences, or just to hit the mattress and sleep. During my stay, I stopped at their restuarant where I had one of the best American style meal in a while. Overall, the Hotel Monaco is a place I would surely stay at again if given the chance to visit Chicago for a second time. It is truely exceptional.
I went to Chicago and We made a reservation to Hotel Monaco Chicago which is a Kimpton Hotel, and I decided to stay in a tranquility suite. Which was amazing I went with my family and all of us had a comfortable space. Room Service Was great served quickly and the cleaners clean quick. Another thing was that it was pet friendly which I thought was cool meaning you could bring your dogs. The hotel was amazing and beutiful.
I frequently have business meetings in Downtown Chicago and find that the Hotel Monaco Chicago, gives me the peace of mind to make those meetings enjoyable. While it might be more expensive than your average hotel....but there is nothing average in this hotel. Exceeds any expectations - service, food, quality, atmosphere were heads above anywhere. Thanks for making my trips to Chicago - the best of the best.
Beautiful hotel in chicago. I visited this hotel on my honeymoon with my wife. They are pet friendly and even provide in room spa services. I would recommend hotel monaco if you are looking to stay in a luxury hotel in chicago.
As I walked into the hotel I was greeted warm heartedly. They took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly. I was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom. Also, I was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient. Overall, I was very happy with my stay at this hotel. 
My stay at the Hotel Monaco recently was fantastic. We got a very reasonable price for our stay (especially since we were a AAA member), and there was plenty of perks to utilize; in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few. Another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that, upon request, the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room. How cool is that! The staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco to anyone in the downtown Chicago area. 
I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago! I was very pleasantly surprised, as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway, and he usually picks bad places-haha. Anyway, the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated. It was busy and the line was a little long, but it moved quickly. The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good, especially since it seemed to be near full. The room was clean and spacious (especially considering it's a city hotel). We made a lot of use of the concierge, since again, it was so last minute we didn't really make any plans. He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy! It was also great being near the theater district, and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare. I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room! very trendy. My husband is not as easily impressed, but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon. Overall, really nice stay in a four star, or probably four and half star hotel!
My husband and I recently traveled to Chicago on a mini vacation. We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in the downtown area. This hotel is simply beautiful. From the time we walked through the front doors until the day we left, we were treated as if we were royalty. I have never been treated so well. We were greeted by staff that sincerely seemed to love their jobs. We stayed in a Superior Corner Suite. The view of the city was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The room didn't seem like we were in a hotel, it had the feeling of home. There was a separate living room area which was wonderful, my husband and I just sat there one night and stared out the window at the skyline. It was mesmerizing. We ordered room service because we had a long day of shopping, which the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping. Most everything is in walking distance. The food was to die for; it was as if we were eating at a 5 star fine dining restaurant. We did manage to go down and have a few drinks in the lounge. The lounge had a classy feel to it, very relaxing yet sophisticated. We even received a massage, in our room. While we did have all the conveniences of home, such as internet and TV, we did not even think about using them, being that we just wanted to get away from our everyday lives. This was the most romantic vacation my husband and I have ever taken. I cannot express how happy we were to have stayed in this hotel. We had other options but I am so glad we decided to stay here. The rate for the room was so inexpensive for the amount of luxury we were able to experience, which the experience itself is priceless. I will definitely share my experience with anyone and everyone and recommend this hotel. 
The Omni Chicago Hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever had the oppertunity to visit. Not only are the desk clerks very helpful, but you feel like a celebrity when you visit. The workout room is great with lots of room so you do not feel cramp. They also have a great indoor pool and a spa. It also comes with 2 sundecks to get a nice tan. If you need a vacation, this is the place to stay.
The Omni Chicago Hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel, particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv's. The windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room, before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows, which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom. An in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay. There's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince. However, the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use, as well as the whirlpool, Jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool. Sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks. A nice aspect that isn't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel. The Omni Chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation, particularly when you don't want to be separated from your pet, within the area. 
I truly enjoyed my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. We stayed in a suite, which was clean and extremely nice, at a very reasonable rate. My husband and I spent quite a bit of time in the indoor pool, but personally I preferred laying out on the sundeck. Service was excellent; they were friendly and all of our needs were met promptly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a great experience in the downtown Chicago area.
I recently had my wedding at the Omni Hotel in Chicago and I was more than pleased. The decision to use a hotel as my wedding reception venue was at first a hard one, I was worried that a hotel would be too impersonal but once I met with the staff at the Omni I was certain that it was the way to go. The staff was so attentive and friendly, and I felt as if my wedding was the most important thing at the hotel. I highly recommend the Omni Hotel in Chicago, brides will not be dissapointed!
The Omni Chicago Hotel is a very high quality hotel. This hotel is a very comfortal and high tech place to relax. It has everything you could possibly want to relax, workout, and feel luxurious. A must stay at hotel, I give it five stars.
My husband and I stayed at the Omni after attending a wedding that took place there. We were delighted at the luxury of the rooms and the accomodations were wonderful. Everyone from the concierge to the housekeepers were friendly and professional. We were extremely pleased with the whole experience and look forward to our next trip to Chicago so we can stay there again. And, by the way, the wedding was absolutely gorgeous!
My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel last weekend and I felt compelled to write a review about this wonderful hotel. I have to say I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the beautiful decor of this hotel. Not to mention the friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever encountered. I frequently stay at hotels for business but have never had such a wonderful experience as I did at the Omni Chicago Hotel. From the minute we walked in the beautiful front doors to the time of our check out we were absolutely treated like royalty. This is one hotel that I would definitely rate 5 stars. You can be sure, I will absolutely be back in the future.
The Omni Chicago Hotel is amazing little get away right on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago. This hotel is warm and homey as well as modern and filled with amenities! The beds are very comfortable and there are flat screen televisions in the rooms (at least both times I have stayed). The Windy City Spa provides a relaxing getaway as well.The indoor pool provides something fun for all ages and the customer service was excellent. The garage was very secure and has unlimited in/out priviledges which made it nice to be able to access the car as much as you wanted without any penalty. All in all, well worth it and will plan to stay again!
I had to go down to Chicago one weekend for the graduation ceremony of my cousin. It was a sudden trip and I didn't even have the time to book a hotel before hand. When I showed up in Chicago and asked my taxi driver to take me to the nearest good hotel, he took me to Omni Chicago Hotel. I was impressed with how clean it was and they didn't have a problem with getting me a room even though I didn't have a reservation. The staff was friendly to me the entire time I was in the hotel, which was just a short two nights, and the cleaning service was top notch.
My family and I vacation in Chicago and stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel. Upon our arrival we were greeted happily and the kids received FREE bagpacks for their stay which they loved. The staff was great and always greeted us as we walked in and out of the hotel. They even remembered our names! The location of the hotel was amazing, right on the Magnificent Mile. We really enjoyed our stay and the kids loved the indoor pool. I would definitely stay there again if I have the chance and would recommend it to anyone I know going to the Chicago area. 
Me and my husband got married here. We loved the atmosphere of our suite. It felt like home away from home. They have a nice pool. The rooms were clean and the staff was courteous. Thanks so much for doing such a great job with our wedding. Amy C. of Los Angelas, California
The Omni Chicago is hands down, the best hotel in my opinion in the chicago area. I am a neat freak but here you need not worry about cleanliness as they are the best at keeping the rooms tidy. Our check in was easy and fast and the staff at the hotel was very courteous and friendly. I forgot my hair dryer but thankfully, one of the many perks at this hotel, they provide one for you in your room! That's a small benefit compared to the lucious pool and dreamy massages they offer! I have never had a massage like that before! My favortie thing about the Omni is the high speed wireless internet that is available to all guests. I am able to do my work online in all areas of the hotel which saved me a lot of time as I was not at my office but still had a lot of work to get done. I also LOVED the TV they provide in the room. A big plasma with a beautiful, crisp picture! I don't even have that at home! Needless to say, I spent almost all night lounging in the comfortable bed watching movies only to fall asleep and wake up to the newspaper delivered to my hotel door in the morning! I will be coming back to the Omni on my next trip to Chicago. That's a promise. 
My stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel was wonderful! I had a last minute business trip, in downtown Chicago, and this is the first place I looked at. I looked at the pictures they show online of the rooms, and the facility itself, and I simply fell in love with the place. The indoor pool, outdoor sun decks, massages, this place really has all you could possibly need, whether you're on vacation, or needing a little stress relieved from a busy week. I mean they even have high speed wireless internet! I would definitely recommend the Omni Chicago Hotel, if you want a great place to stay near Downtown Chicago!
We really enjoyed our stay! It is a beautiful hotel and the entire staff is helpful and polite. They had great suggestions on where to eat, what to do, etc. We were within walking distance of many great Chicago locations like the Navy Pier and Art Institute. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable, I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great home away from home in Chicago.
We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently and had a great experience! My husband and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Chicago. We are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained, luxury properties with many amenities and the Omni Chicago definitely fit the bill. First of all, the hotel is all suites. We stayed in one of the "Premium Suites". The accommodations were definitely luxurious, with premium bedding, very nice robes for our use, and a choice of pillows. We used the hypo-allergenic ones, but I believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers. We were pleased to find that the TV was plasma, we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we don't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of TVs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home. There were actually two TVs in our suite. There were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access, a wet bar, an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside. The location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the Miracle Mile, with so much to do practically at the Omni's doorstep. I also treated myself to the Windy City Massage, which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite. The masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin. It was extremely relaxing and I was so pleased to find out that I could get this at the Omni. It was easy for us to see why the Omni came so highly recommended. I also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly, recommending several excellent area restaurants. However, we think our best meal was at the Omni's 676 Restaurant, where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and I had the carrot soup and the Lake Erie Silver Bass. They had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff's guidance. Lastly, the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby Art Institute of Chicago, which was a highlight of our trip. We loved that there were multiple museums so close to the Omni! We will be frequent visitors at the Omni in the future, where I will definitely be getting the in-room massage again. We are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the Omni for a great Chicago experience!
The location of this hotel was superb! Our room was spacious and the view was spectacular. The staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect. One of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter. We will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same.
The Omni Chicago Hotel was a delight to stay in. The second you step into the place, it takes your breath away. It's very modern with an antique twist. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. They are clean. Every member of the staff was courteous and polite. Proud of their place of work. Happy to be there. You don't often see that. The room service was phenomenal. Visiting Chicago was amazing, and staying at the Omni Hotel made my visit that much better. The luxurious pools were an added plus as well. I also enjoyed the gym facilities. I will definitely be staying at the Omni Hotel on my next visit. 
Luxury and comfort combine to give a wonderful sense of relaxation for guests at the Omni Chicago Hotel. Their rooms are some of the cleanest and most well-furnished I have ever seen at a four-diamond hotel, and the 676 Lounge, which has accommodating late hours, was perfect for me to relax after a day of work. The workout room is absolutely HUGE, and each treadmill has its own TV to watch while working out - fantastic! Overall, my experience at the Omni was amazing. I'll definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Chicago!
The Omni Chicago Hotel I am a business woman who travels a great deal out of a month, therefore, my accommodations must meet the highest standards. I was booked for a stay at The Omni Chicago Hotel, located in what is referred to as ' The Magnificent Mile ' in the greater Chicago area. ' Magnificent ', it was! The beautifully red-bricked sky scraper was indeed a breath- taking sight and upon entrance, I had a felling of warmth from the very hospitable welcoming staff. I was impressed with the hotels special rates offered during prime business hours and the guest rooms ranged everything from ' The Presidential Suite to The Governors Suite '. I accepted a more humble room as I would not need to spend very much time there during the day. I did stay inside most nights and the amenities were more than satisfactory. I enjoyed the very spacious exercise room and afterwards, I would take a quick dip in the pool. I toured the hotel as my niece is planning her wedding and just so happens to live close to the hotel. The ' Chagall Ballroom ', was elegant enough for such an occasion and reeked of pure luxury. I was given very adequate maps and directions to and from as my business was conducted throughout the city. That was a life saver. All in all, my experience was more than favorable and I would definitely stay there again along with recommending it to anyone. 
An excellent vacation destination. Clean rooms and many nice features. Superb location and proximity to local attractions. Staff is always friendly and eager to help. Highly recommended to anyone looking to travel to this area. 
A hotel made for royalty. Decked out to the top with luxuries you could only dream of, it is an amazing experience! It's located right in the middle of everything in Chicago, and pulls in all the best attributes of the city into one fun filled experience. The customer service was fantastic, as they were very responsive and polite to my requests and fixed any complaints without a complaint of their own. A beautiful experience that I would certainly do again!
I stayed here with my family when we were in Chicago on a family vacation. All I can say is WOW! A fantastic experience all around. First off, the hotel is magnificent, the lobby/entreway is jaw dropping to say the least. Everyone we dealt with from the desk clerks, to the cleaning staff, to the doormen were all exceptionally cordial and friendly. The rooms themselves are fantastic, perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation. The new Serenity beds that the Hilton offered were to die for! One of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years! The kids loved the Ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and I loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours. As usual, it had wifi, which was ultra cheap and very very fast. Over all i highly recommend The Palmer House Hilton!
The Palmer House Hlton Hotel has to be the nicest hotel I have stayed at in Chicago. I went to Chicago on a business trip for a meeting. When I arrived once I walked in, the lobby was beautiful, I couldn't hardly wait to see my room. The rooms were just as nice, the bathroom was immaculate! We had a meeting in the Clark Meeting Room, even that was nice! I wanted to take a tour of the hotel itself! I was there for about 3 days and because of how convenient the hotel was to a lot of major attractions like, Grant Park, Lake Michigan, Mag Mile which is a shopping heaven, and the Navy Pier, it never really like the normal stressed out meetings. I love Chicago and I now have a new favorite hotel to stay at while I'm in town. 
My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago for our anniversary. The hotel was beautiful and luxurious as one would expect from a Hilton brand hotel in a major city. The service was excellent with check-in and check-out going smoothly. The location of the hotel was ideal for us as we had plans to attend the theater, visit the Lincoln Park zoo and picnic by the lake. All of these were very close to our hotel. The price was reasonable for the location and luxurious accommodations. We also enjoyed the hotel restaurant and lounge. Highly recommend. 
If anyone is traveling to Chicago, I would strongly recommend the Palmer House Hilton. I have spent two nights in this hotel during a recent business trip and I was impressed by the elegant feel and look of the hotel. I had a guest room with a double bed. At the first sight, the room had perfect decor. The double bed looked comfy and cozy. It wasn't just a room because it also came with high speed internet and personalized listening options which were great features for a tired traveler like me. Since I was in a hurry in my two-day stay, I didn't have time to wander around the town for food. It wasn't a problem because the hotel offered a few places to dine or simply for snacks. The good thing is that their bar and lounge opened late at night. I can assure you that they had great quality food and drinks. If you are just touring the city, the hotel is quite close to parks, museum, and a lot of shopping places. If you just need a place to stay, the view from the hotel was pretty good as well. Among all the hotels I have spent time in, the Palmer House Hilton tops the list. 
My husband and I stayed at The Palmer House Hilton last month to celebrate our anniversary. What a wonderful hotel!! We had such a great weekend, largely thanks to The Palmer House. Every amenity we could want was right there at the hotel, at our fingertips. And the location is perfect--right in downtown Chicago. We stayed in one of their one bedroom king suites. It was exquisite--so elegant and beautiful. It was easily the most luxurious suite we have ever stayed in. The service was impeccable. Every employee we encountered was both pleasant and eager to accomodate any need we expressed. We had our anniversary dinner at the Lockwood Restaurant in the hotel. It was delicious! We will definitely return to the Palmer House Hilton for our next special weekend getaway. 
My husband and I snagged a great deal on a weekend trip to Chicago, and decided (at the recommendation of friends) to stay at the Palmer House Hilton. The only word we can use to describe it is "amazing"! Walking into the lobby feels like stepping back in time, it is simply breath-taking. Be sure to check out the ceiling, I have never seen one so beautiful outside of Europe. We checked-in without any issues and were assigned a very lovely room with the most comfortable bed I have encountered in any hotel. Everything is in walking distance of the Palmer House, you couldn't hope to find a better location for exploring downtown Chicago. Everything was perfect with our stay here, I would not stay anywhere else in Chicago from now on.
The Palmer House Hilton is located in the heart of the theatre, financial and shopping districts of downtown Chicago. It is walking distance to museums, shopping, government and corporate buildings. The location makes it perfect for visiting Chicago. The rooms are luxurious, with super comfortable beds and soft sheets. The rooms was clean and quite nice looking. The hotel's restaurants are amazing. The hotel would definately exceed your expectations, whether you are a business traveler or there on vacation. 
The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home. From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby, you will never want to leave. The multiple ballrooms, board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events. If you're looking for leisure activities, there are two bars, the Lockwood Wine Cellar, and an indoor pool. The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. Room service is excellent, and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city. 
The Palmer House Hilton hotel has it all for the business and leisure traveler out there! I stayed at this hotel on business and all I can say is WOW!!! One of the main things that I liked about the hotel was the indoor pool! I loved being able to go swimming even though it was December and 5 degrees outside! Also, the hotel does offer wireless in the room and this really came in handy for me to keep up with my work after my meetings. I dined at Lockwood Restaurant and Bar and the food was amazing for a hotel! One thing that was a minor negative is that pets are allowed and my original room was next door to a barking dog, but the hotel staff was fantastic as switched up my room so I didn't have to deal with that! All in all, this hotel was fantastic and I look forward to the next time I get to stay here!
My husband and I recently chose the Palmer House Hilton for a rare couple's getaway from our usual life, and an escape it truly provided. There is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time, let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user! A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us, because things like alarm clocks, hairdryers and ironing boards were already there, electronic media even available for rent. With a comfortable bed, control over how the room felt, no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call, we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity. Too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning, but the Hilton was a true vacation. Thank you.
Very beautiful hotel. The historic features of this hotel make it absolutely amazing. This hotel offers many great guest accommodations of which I enjoyed the spacious, tidy rooms. The staff here are very friendly, helpful, and professional. The concierge went out of her way to make sure we knew about the area and not just what was in the hotel. I especially enjoyed the service at The Lockwood Restaurant here. Our server was excellent and the food was delicious! I must say this hotel exceeded my expectations. All in all, my stay was awesome!
Everything experienced at this hotel was grand. The hotel itself is stunning and the architecture is amazing. From the moment you walk into The Palmer House, you are greeted by friendly helpful staff. The rooms are out of this world with no detail overlooked. Comfortable beds, amazing bathrooms and breathtaking views of Chicago. If you are looking for an extravagant hotel for your next visit to the windy city, i would definately recommend you stay here. Experience Chicago like never before.
The Palmer House Hilton is an incredible break from the real world. The lobby is a throwback to the grand era of travel, and you can just imagine people stepping off the train with their steamer trunks. The lobby is luxe and gilded, with soaring ceilings and is staffed with friendly, accommodating employees. The rooms are plush, with each bed furnished with a Serenity Dreams topper for extra comfort. The room decor is modern and sleek, a world from the tacky furnishings in most hotels. For your convenience, there's a fully-stocked business center, pool, fitness room and workout area - something to accommodate the solo, business or family traveller. 
The Palmer House Hilton hotel takes luxury to a whole new level of existence. The rooms are beautifully decorated, with class and superior quality furniture. The hotels restaurant "lockwood" consist's of delicious French and Italian cuisine. The location is in the prime area to downtown, and shopping areas. This hotel is suited for pristine guests, and those who are not willing to settle for less. If you're looking for not just any stay, but a stay in luxury, you should give The Palmer House Hilton a try. It is one of the best of the best in Chicago, and your stay will be one to remember.
We really enjoyed our stay at the Palmer House Hilton. We were in Chicago for a weekend stay, and wanted something close to State Street, and convenient to the theatre district and the museums, and Michigan Ave. shopping. This is a grand old hotel, with just about every amenity one could wish for. The lobby is fabulous, and the hotel also has some nice restaurants . Our room had a nice king sized bed, and was pretty cozy. Hotel employees were very nice and helpful to us. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a "grand hotel" type experience at a reasonable price for the many amenities and in a very convenient spot in downtown Chicago. You will definitely feel special.
The Palmer House Hilton was recommended to me by a friend who had visited Chicago the previous summer. I was very happy with the location , and was able to visit the nearby Lake Michigan and Millennium park (beautiful!!). The rooms were good size , and the right amount of luxury for the price. I didn't use room service much , but when I did everything was in order. 
My stay at The Palmer House Hilton was wonderful. I was attracted to this Hotel because it was going to be me and my finance's first time in Chicago. The location of the hotel was perfectly placed Downtown Chicago We took advantage of the Hilton Bed and Breakfast Special. Upon Check in on Friday afternoon we went to the Lockwood restaurant before going to the room for the weekend. We stayed in a One Bedroom Suite with a King Size Bed. The Hotel was spotless. I have never been in a Hotel Room that was so clean. The portions of food was perfect, and everything they provided was on point. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is going to visit Chicago for the first time. The staff is professional, and let you feel like a King and Queen.
Amazing! I was swept away when I walked into the hotel it was gorgeous. The staff was very nice and helpful the hotel was very clean, and the food was delicious. We stayed two nights and the first night we went to the Lockwood restaurant and we were blown away by the food. It has to be the best food in Chicago the atmosphere was very classy and warm and the wait staff was very precise. The decor in our rooms did not look like any hotel I had been at they were very elegant and inviting. I cannot wait to go back it is a true escape from daily life.
My family and I stayed here while we were visiting Chicago. This was a perfect location to many of the things we wanted to do and was easy to get around. It was in a safe neighborhood and was great accomodations. The staff was friendly and went the "extra mile" to make sure we had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable. We would definitely stay here again. 
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was an awesome place to stay. Nothing bad about it. It was a great value. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were nice and open, and the pool was great. Food was GREAT! My family and I loved staying here! Would recommend to everyone I know.
If there is ever a Hotel you should stay at it is the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. This is the most beautiful Hotel I have ever seen. This Hotel has more than you will ever need or want. You can pick from a room that is decorated in great taste. There is a in room refreshment center,high speed Internet, 32 inch television ,coffer maker with great coffee from Starbucks. You could get a suite or the Presidential suite with more room than you will ever need. The room is over 2000 square feet.It over looks the Chicago River. There is plenty of activities with a great fitness center and a big indoor heated pool.The sauna was just wonderful. If you want to sight see in the area you can walk to the Navy pier,or Art Institute. When you come back hungry you can eat at the elegant steakhouse which had some of the best food we ever ate. Have a few drinks at the great bar, then create your own burger at the Chicago Burger Company. The staff was very friendly and super helpful. The Hotel was the cleanest I have ever seen. I will come again and again. A big thumbs up to this great Hotel. 
What a gorgeous hotel! From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago. The heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better, and to top it off with great restaurants, you couldn't ask a hotel for more! Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we'll be back every time we visit Chicago. 
When my sister got married last summer, our stay at the Sheraton Hotel was delightful! Billy and the kids and I were exhausted after the long flight from San Francisco, so it's a good thing that we found the perfect place to relax! The kids ADORED the indoor pool, Billy couldn't stop talking about the beautiful jogging path, and I even pampered myself by taking advantage of the massage therapy before the big day. The reception dinner at Shula's Steakhouse was fun and delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any one who is in Chicago for an extended visit!
My Stay at Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was wonderful, i stayed in the traditional guest room and i slept good, i was able to get to my meeting well rested, thank you Sheraton! -Bobby
Thanks Sheraton Towers for the invite to enjoy your indoor pool while a guest at your hotel recently. I did not know that the skyline of Chicago could be so beautiful or an afternoon at the pool so enjoyable. I'll be back soon and look forward to a seeing Chicago again.
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is my favorite place to stay in Chicago! I travel to Chicago very often to visit my son, who is training for the U.S. Navy. They make every stay feel like a luxorius vacation. The indoor pool and sauna are amazing, and I never have to miss a workout because the gym is fully equipped. If you dine at the LB Bistro, you must try the Eggs Benedict :) The staff are friendly and the prices are very reasonable for a hotel of this stature.
I walked into this beautiful hotel and knew that I would have a wonderful stay in Chicago. After walking around the city all day, I was always excited to relax in this cleanly and superbly comforting place. The service was friendly and I especially liked the location. What a Treat!
This is an absolutely gorgeous hotel. We had an amazing view of the city, especially at night. Our room was luxurious with extremely comfortable beds. There was a desk and chair, large bathroom, comfortable chair and reading lamp. There was also an area for snacks and a coffee maker, that included Starbucks coffee. We would definitely come back again! 
We were hungry and tired when we checked into the Chicago Sheraton. The nice clerk at the front desk got us checked in efficiently and with a warm smile. He made us dinner reservations at Shula's (giving us time to shower and change) and arranged for a bellhop to take our bags up to the room for us - what service!! We enjoyed our steaks and the bottle of wine that was recommended by the waiter at Shula's - truly a lovely meal. When we returned to our room we were delighted to find that the towels had been replenished and the bed turned down! We enjoyed the view from our room before turning in and having a very restful night's sleep in an incredibly comfortable bed. KUDOS to the Chicago Sheraton for getting everything just right! 
 My wife and I's stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers proved to be the perfect complement to our time spent visiting and exploring the Windy City. Upon our arrival, we were immediately welcomed by the beautiful design of the first-floor lobby and the friendly demeanor of the desk and bell service staff. In seemingly no time at all we were in our clean and well-furnished room with a beautiful and peaceful view of Lake Michigan. In terms of accommodations, I have never personally stayed at a hotel that I could complement more. On our very first night, my wife took advantage of a message therapy session while I swam a few laps in the heated indoor swimming pool. We followed our time apart with a very relaxing time at the Chi bar, which had a very enlivening and laid-back atmosphere. Retiring to our rooms, I couldn't help but remark to my wife about the quality of our room and the bed in particular. I had a very comfortable night's sleep and woke up just on time thanks to a spot-on wake up call from the desk staff. After a quick bite to eat the LB Bistro, we headed out to sight-see. Overall, I can't recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers enough. As far as this customer is concerned, it is the only place to stay if you are in the Chicago area and are looking for accommodations with the best customer service, atmosphere, and amenities. I couldn't recommend it more. 
 I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers a couple nights ago. The service was excellent!! As soon as i stepped through the door they grabbed my bags, and were helping me choose the best hotel room for me! I loved there service and the room was gorgeous! I highly recommend it for anyone, and there prices aren't as bad as others. I loved the experience and I'm sure next time I'm in the area I'll visit again!
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel for two nights and I must say the service they rendered was quite impressive. They had very attentive and friendly staff members. The room that I stayed in was spacious for me and my husband. Their hotel restaurant served the most delicious steaks I have tasted, I ordered a classic fillet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if ever I come back to Chicago and would absolutely highly recommend this to my friends and family.
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was everything you could ask for in a hotel. It was meticulously clean, very orderly, but still perfectly warm and comforting. The rooms are very big and spacious, and the beds are so soft, it's like heaven! I didn't test out the room service, but I'm sure it would be just like everything else... perfect!The hotel staff are just so nice. There was a spectacular view from my room, and looking out over the city at night is so magical. There are resturants that are easy to access from the hotel, and I especially recommend Shula's Steak House. Overall, I had a fantastic stay at The Sheraton Hotel, and I would definitely stay there again!
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a magnificent grand hotel. The size of the rooms, and the views of the city are phenomenal. At night the city lights up, and the sight is majestic. The hotel itself, and the employee's are wonderful, and well worth the pay to stay in such a place. This Hotel has so much to offer, great dining,a fantastic gym set up for those of us, who really like to stay fit no matter what we are doing.My wife and I have just left recently, and we are already planning to stay there on our next trip out. Big thumbs up to Those who run that place, and helped us enjoy our stay.
My husband and I loved this hotel. The staff were friendly, the food on the room service menu was a reasonable price, and we got an extra (free) coffeepot in our room immediately when we asked for it. Highly recommended!
I was completely unfamiliar with Chicago but needed a place to stay while my husband worked there for a few days and we picked the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based solely on their internet site. Wow did I get lucky! This is a beautiful hotel with all of amenities I could have hoped for, terrific food, and within walking distance of several interesting places, including the Art Institute of Chicago. Ashley, at the concierge desk, was particularly helpful at guiding a Chicago newbie to the best places to eat ands to see. I will heartily recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers.
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers for three days while I was in Chicago on business. This was quite possibly the best hotel experience that I have ever had, which says a lot considering the fact that I stay in hotels quite frequently. The staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating. They made sure that I had absolutely everything that I could want or need. Their friendliness came across in a very genuine manner, not fake or forced like some employees can be. The room itself was to die for. The bedding was so soft and the room was extremely clean and well kept. I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of the mattress and bedding! Because of the mattress and bedding, I got the best three nights of sleep I've ever had. The views of downtown Chicago were absolutely amazing from my room. The way the city lights sparkled stole my heart and almost made me want to move to Chicago. The food was amazing also. I made it a point to eat at all three of the hotel's restaurants and visit the bar while I was there. My favorite restaurant of the three was Shula's Steak House. The Chi Bar, the hotel's bar, was amazingly designed and the drinks were great. All in all, i would rate my experience a 5 out of 5. There is nowhere else in downtown Chicago that compares to the Sheraton.
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers on a recent trip to Chicago, and had a great stay. The rooms were beautiful, the beds comfortable, and the views of the city were fantastic. My room overlooked the river and the city. I felt like I was on a luxury vacation. The hotel has a few different restaurants. I ate at the Chicago Burger Company, which was delicious. The burgers were juicy, and the prices were great. The indoor pool was a great way for me to relax and entertain the kids in between sightseeing activities. Overall, I had a wonderful stay. 
On our first trip to Chicago, my fiance and I stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel and the service we received from the personnel. In the past from other "luxury hotels" we have paid much more and received much less. Here the room were very spacious, comfortable and sleek. We spent come time in the hotel bar, LE BAR, and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none! We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel's Cafe des Architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time. If traveling with a lover we recommend the "Air of Romance" package. It was the best! 6 stars!
This is an absolutely exquisite hotel, at a great location, and boasting superb amenities. I was here on a personal trip and really enjoyed being so close to the shopping on Michigan Ave. The hotel itself has a pleasant ambiance and the staff made me feel welcome and quickly responded to my requests for various items from the front desk. I appreciated the homey, well-designed interior and views of the city. It was also nice to have good food at my disposal late night so I didn't have to wander the city for my late night meal. This will definitely be my hotel of choice when I return to the city. 
This hotel was gorgeous! I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be returning in the future. The staff was friendly, the room was clean, comfortable and very well decorated. The restaurant/ room service was also exceptional. The food was delicious and the room service was prompt. This hotel is also in a great location. It is close to everything anyone may need, such as shopping, food and attractions.
I traveled to Chicago with my husband for a romantic weekend away. Our stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower could not have been more luxurious! Our room had anything you could ever want, a mini bar, air conditioning. We were also within walking distance of many sites and fun restaurants. The staff was friendly, and the beds were like clouds. Overall,the experience was worth every penny. 
I stayed in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend, and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels. The spacious rooms with modern, innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small, dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that I have found at other hotel chains. The bathrooms were neat, tidy, and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper, shampoo, and soap. The carpet was clean (not stained and dingy like some hotels), the room decor was astounding, and the view from our window was wonderful. I enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay, from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out. Thanks for making me feel right at home!
I recently traveled up to Chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in downtown. The location was perfect as it gave me easy access to Michigan Avenue and the conference center where I was doing business. My hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. I ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so I was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. The food was extremely good and I really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. I had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. I woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. They had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well. After shower I headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests. The breakfast was delicious and started my day out right. After my business stuff was over I really got out and enjoyed Chicago. I met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well. When I go back to Chicago I will definitely stay at the Sofitel again.
My husband and I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for our wedding anniversary - and what a pleasant stay we had! From the first moment we walked in, we were overwhelmed at the classy elegance of the lobby. I casually mentioned that it was our anniversary, and after we came back from dinner, we found champagne and strawberries awaiting us in the room. The staff was professional but friendly, and made us feel so welcome. The room was immaculate, the furnishings were so plush - we didn't really want to go home! Room service was prompt, and the views were spectacular! We are definitely going to make this visit a yearly repeat. 
I think the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a upscale place.I had my wedding there and it was the best of the best.The staff was so helpful and made me feel confident that my wedding would be a success. The chef prepared a lavish sit down dinner with appetizers and desserts.They also had a wonderful pastry chef who baked my wedding cake.The tables were decorated in very good taste and could not be more perfect.The bar was also set up the way I wanted it and even had a champagne fountain. My guests had a wonderful experience with their stay at the hotel and felt pampered.The rooms were like suites with a mini bar.They had terry cloth bathrobes in each bathroom. If you are looking to have a wedding in the Chicago area look into having it here you will not be disappointed!
MY WIFE AND I STAYED HERE LAST WEEKEND. IT WAS OUR HONEYMOON AND IT WAS WONDERFUL. THIS HOTEL WAS SO BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT. WE WERE MORE THAN PLEASED WITH OUR ROOM AND THE RESTURANT WAS AMAZING. ALL OF THE STAFF HERE WERE VERY NICE AND POLITE. THEY HELPED US WITH ANY OF OUR NEEDS. I WISH I COULD LIVE IN THIS PLACE. ALL TOGETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST WEEKENDS OF OUR LIVES. WE PLAN ON COMING BACK AGAIN. GREAT HOTEL!
Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a four star hotel that is minutes aways from the Magnificent mile, Navy Peir, The museum of contemperary art, lake michigan and upscale boutiques. This hotel is great for tourest. it has 450 great rooms and 33 high end sweets. It has a modern diesighn and rich arcitechusall legacy. IT has great food and out door dinning it also has a great veiws, while drinking wine and champane cotails in there amazing bar. Overall this hotel is by far the best hotel ive stayed in.
My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for a fun anniversary weekend away from the kids. Upon check in we were pleasantly surprised by the decor, the location to so many downtown attractions and the attentiveness of the staff. As a seasoned traveler for business I consider myself somewhat savvy when it comes to service and accommodations. This hotel certainly delivers on both accounts. My wife and I had not intended on eating in the hotel restaurant, but after reviewing the menu we thought we would give it a try. WOW! Service was outstanding and the food was amazing. We truly enjoyed our dining experience. All in all I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone I meet. 
This hotel is beautiful, it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it. The location is wonderful,it is close to magnificent mile and the Navy pier, which was a great place to show the children on our vacation. We had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car,and the valet was very nice and helpful. I also take my work with me everywhere I go,So the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus. They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing. This place is great for the price, due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is. This is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay. 
The Sofitel Water Tower was a wonderful place to stay for my husband and me for our 20th anniversary weekend trip to Chicago. We got married in the city but then moved away, and it was so romantic to return. We loved how near the Sofitel was to everything - the Magnificent Mile was just outside our door, and we could walk to Navy Pier and other attractions as well. Chicago has changed, but the Sofitel made it feel like home again... except a very plush and elegant version of home! We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had great views of the city, and room service was very attentive when we called for champagne after midnight the day we arrived. Both nights before leaving for supper, we had a cocktail in Le Bar and enjoyed talking about what we'd done during the day, and all the great memories this town has for us. But I have to say we have some new great memories now, thanks to the Sofitel Water Tower!
I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel and I could not be more pleased. The hotel is sleek from the elegant lobby to the modern, stylish rooms. The rooms are something truly special with huge, soft beds with the most luxurious sheets you have ever seen and felt. The bathrooms are beautiful with cool marble tiles and a gorgeous glass and marble shower/tub. If that wasn't enough each room has a crisp 32" LCD TV that displays TV in the most beautiful and clear way with an absolutely amazing sound system. When you finally make it out of your room, down the grand stair case you need not look further for dinner than the hotel restaurant. It is called Cafe des Architectes and like the hotel itself melds a modern sophistication with classic French techniques. Their wine list is amazing but their prices are fantastic for a hotel near the Magnificent mile. A full dinner including appetizer, main course, and dessert can be had for $45, amazing. If you are looking for a modern, urban, chic hotel in Chicago then look no further, the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel is your only real choice.
 If you are traveling anywhere near Lake Michigan within the next year or less, I would highly recommend staying at The Sofitel Hotel. Unbeatable elegance, fine dining, and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of. Along with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest. If there were such a thing as a 10 star rating, The Sofitel would surely have it. My visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort. Located minutes from everything in downtown Chicago, one would hardly want to leave. Fine dining, dancing, and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting, or social event in town. The Sofitel Hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave.
I would like to add a comment, maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination. My daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower; we were amazed. She always wanted a ballroom type of wedding, and Sofitel made this happen for her. They took care of all the invitations, cake decor, and so much more. The special day for my daughter was worth everything. If you are going to be in the Chicago area, check them out; you will not regret it!
Best hotel in an excellent location I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower with my husband and kid as he came there for a Business purpose. My 1 year old kid was jumping on the bed and he really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room. The front desk people were too welcoming and the staffs were very friendly . The room service was also good. The room was very clean and the bathrooms are so good . I like the decor of the room. The French restaurant in Sofitel is so good and we both enjoyed the dining . I will surely prefer to stay in Sofitel on a next time travel to Chicago.
Couldn't have asked for a better home base for checking out downtown Chicago. Hotel Sofitel is right in the heart of the action, allowing my friends and I to hit the clubs and enjoy the local cuisine downtown's famous for. The room was comfy, with two queen mattresses, down stuffed duvets and chic decor. The bar downstairs was a bit pricey, but made up for it by being comfortable, sleek, and staffed with attentive bartenders who made excellent cocktails. One night we didn't feel like going out so we headed downstairs to eat at the Cafe des Architectes, which had an amazing array of choices, mostly of the French persuasion. I would definitely book here again! 
I was very satisfied after staying at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. The service was excellent, as the staff was very helpful and polite. The beds were very comfortable, and the rooms were very spacious. I will definitely be returning to this hotel.
My stay at the Sofitel was great. I loved the location it was in. From the moment I arrived the experince was great, the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too. I thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable. The room service was excllent and they were very friendly. Checkout was a breeze and I couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay. 
I absolutely loved staying at the Swissotel Chicago. The entire hotel has such an elegant and luxurious feel to it. The room was absolutely stunning! First of all, it was so spotless and clean. The design of it was beautiful! There was gorgeous artwork on the walls even. The design was very modern and above average for hotel decor. There was a separate bath and separate shower which I loved! There was a huge LCD flat screen TV and high speed wireless Internet available. There was even an iPod docking station which was great for listening to music and so convenient since I brought my iPod with me! The view from the window of Chicago was beautiful too. The service was very quick and everyone was very friendly. I didn't have any problems at all but if I did I'm sure the customer service at the hotel would have had it fixed very quick I could tell their top priority was the guests happiness and satisfaction! There were even two restaurants in the hotel and a lounge! I can't wait to go back to this hotel. It felt like I was on a luxurious vacation! 
The Swissotel Chicago was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at in Chicago. It was clean, modern, and the staff were very friendly, even to our large family with cranky kids at a very late hour. The room was fantastic and you can not beat it for the price. Not only was the room fantastic, but so was the view. Our room looked out over the skyline and it was breathtaking, especially at night. The best part of the hotel was its location. It was located within walking distance to so many fun attractions, including Navy Pier and the Sears Tower. Our stay was wonderful, and we can't wait to go back again. 
A perfect place for couples to get away too. The location couldn't be better,just three blocks from Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile. It's really romantic, the service was awesome. Very clean and quiet. It has big rooms with comfortable atmosphere, huge bathroom.Over all, i had the a great experience there, would definitely stay there again!
Stays here while on a business trip in Chicago. First off the staff were very friendly and helpful. They were knowledgeable about the things in the area when I needed to find something. I had a king bed room - it was very clean and cozy and the view was great. This is definitely a hotel I will stay at again if my work takes me back to Chicago.
Everything you would would expect from a top-notch hotel and exceeded by the service. The trendy decor and easy to access dining gave us a 'second-wind' pick up after a day of sight-seeing. This hotel is definitely the place that I want to come back to. By the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights, my wife and I wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful Swiss flare. One of the things we enjoyed the most was seeing the water from our window. The feeling of being pampered can only come from the very gracious hotel staff and this hotel is number 1 in my mind. 
Staying at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago is not so much the typical stay so much as it is an experience. Not only is the hotel located in a great area to get to all local attractions, but while you are at the hotel you will have many amazing accommodations at your disposal. There are two gourmet on site restaurants and a lounge to relax and get great food. The rooms are over sized and the beds are among the most comfortable you will ever find. Finally, the service is award winning so anything that you do not already have at the Swissotel will be at your fingertips with their assistance. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for more than the typical hotel.
My family and I recently attended a wedding in Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel. It was much nicer than we expected. We are used to staying at mid-class hotels and this, by far, was one of the nicest places we've stayed. The beds were so comfortable and the crib the provided for my infant son was great quality - I was concerned that we would get a rickety 1970s crib! The bed sheets were so soft that I wanted to take them home! We will definitely go back to this hotel the next time we are in Chicago.
I must say, this hotel is absolutely beautiful. My wife and I were blown away by the penthouse fitness center and pool all the way up on the 42nd floor. Very well designed rooms with great linens and pillows. The bathrooms were a nice change of pace from the boring hotel bathrooms we usually see. Overall an excellent experience here, great views and close to everything you could want to do in Chicago.
This hotel was wonderful. My room was clean and the staff was courteous. The food provided by the restaurant was exceptional. This was on of the best hotel stays, ive experienced. I highly suggest this hotel to others. 
 We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago. It was elegant, classy, and the service was impeccable. It was very family friendly for us, with the spacious rooms, the kid's room, and the no smoking policy. We were just a short walk away from shopping and entertainment and the whole family enjoyed the virtual city tour that helped us decide what we wanted to see. The food was delicious and we didn't have to go outside the hotel to find good food. When visiting Chicago again, we will come back. It was a luxurious experience at a reasonable price. Linda Davies 
This hotel is one superior hotel. The prices are reasonable and the benefits are just fantastic. My husband and I got a package that lets us get a hotel with a view and the view was amazing. Waking up to seeing Lake Michigan was a site not to miss. The rooms were always cleaned when we got back from our shopping at Bloomingdales or in other places in Chicago, and the customer service was top notch and very friendly.
If you are ever going to visit Chicago and need a place to stay I recommend this hotel. This hotel made my stay in Chicago one that I will always remember. The rooms were very big and luxurious, everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service. The room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was 24 hours so I could get anything whenever I wanted. The price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because I got great service and I saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite. If you are ever going to be in the Chicago area and need a hotel to stay in I recommend this hotel!
I stayed at this hotel for a weekend and I thought it was really nice. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. The room also had a beautiful view. It had everything you could possibly need. I almost didn't want to leave the room. It was definitly worth the price. I would go back. The clientel was also very helpful. 
My husband and I had a wonderful time at Swissotel Chicago, when my husband went for a trade fair. We got a classic double room for two nights and it was definitely worth the money. Clean and comfortable, chic and new fixtures. The view of the pier was magnificent. Staff were most helpful and prompt when we requested extra towels and pillow. It's right next to riverside restaurants and river is very pretty.
The Swissotel Chicago is a delight to visit. Located in downtown Chicago this hotel has nine different styles of room accommodations to serve everyones taste. They have children friendly rooms as well as the exquisite presidential suite. Rooms have exceptional views of downtown Chicago. This hotel also has a penthouse fitness center and pool for entertainment. Other places to stop by to eat is the Palms, Geneva and the Lobby Lounge.
Beautiful views and awesome service! My husband and I stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago while meeting up with some old friends from college. We have been to Chicago a few times but never stayed at this hotel before. First off the architecture and feel of the hotel is just amazing. So beautiful! The views from our corner suite was breathtaking and the accomodations were flawless. The fact that we could have an apartment like setting rather than a cold hotel room made all the difference. From the big tub in the bath to the entertainment system and work area, everything is in place to make your stay like being at home but with an awesome view of the Chicago Skyline. We took advantage of the Executive Club for desserts and breakfast and had dinner one night at the Palm restaurant. Delicious food! We will definitely stay at the Swissotel the next time we visit Chicago.
Elegant and modernized hotel with great staff. Location is wonderful. The health club located in the hotel had everything needed to get my complete workout. I will be staying there again due to the wonderful experience and decent prices.
When I was asked to stay at the Swissotel in Chicago, I immediately went to their website to check them out. What I found there was decent, nothing really stood out. It wasn't until I actually went there that my eyes were opened. The amazing customer service I received there was exceptional. Every whim and detail I asked for they helped me perfectly. The room was neatly fixed when I arrived and was cleaned every day. When I asked about more towels, the maids were happy to help me out. If I were ever to be in that area again, I know exactly where I'm staying, the Swissotel.
This is the hotel for the discriminating business traveler. It offers spacious rooms that are elegant and refined. With a cozy area complete with chairs and fireplace, they are the perfect place to entertain clients or discuss strategy for a business meeting with a colleague. The restaurant offers just the location to impress a perspective client. And all of this elegance and refinement in the heart of downtown Chicago
I stayed at Swissotel Chicago when I was on business and it was very nice. The staff was very helpful and room was very clean. I would stay again in a heart beat!
I recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three. I absolutely loved it and will definitely return! The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic. They were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay. For the nights we didn't want to go out, we had room service. The food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick. I also loved their commitment to the environment. It is clear to me why they have won so many awards. Thank you Talbott for a wonderful stay!
"Classy","Decent" and "Serene". these words clearly define the totality of my stay at the talbott hotel in the heart of chicago. the hustle and bustle of the city did little to affect the conducive atmosphere for relaxation provided by this posh hotel. the lounge was so welcoming and flashes of smiles from every angle.the staff from the bell-boy to the managers were polite, helpful and responsive to my needs. the room service was classy and to cap it all the beds were just as comfortable as back home, making the talbott a home away from home. my wife and i enjoyed the t-rex experience and learnt a lot about the city of chicago and what it has got to offer. believe me we will return with the kids because the talbott is family oriented and friendly to kids. it felt very safe. anytime we are in chicago the talbott is gonna be our home away from home!
The Talbott Hotel is fantastic! I stayed there on business and found that it met my every need. The high speed internet access worked flawlessly; allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room. I really like to exercise before a day of meetings; access to the fitness club next door was very convenient. Last point: I work for a green consulting firm out of L.A. and the hotel's environmental credentials dovetailed perfectly with our mission. Guilt free luxury!
This hotel was everything we were looking for. My mom and I were on a girls weekend out shopping trip and just needed a place to stay after a long day out. The Talbott Hotel was incredible. The rooms were very clean and spacious and had everything we needed. The hotel check in was easy and the guest services folks were awesome! They even gave us tips on great restaurants in the area. Highly recommend this hotel on your next trip to chicago!
My husband and I decided to plan a romantic get-away for our one year anniversary when we stumbled upon the Talbott Hotel in Chicago. We decided to book the "Personally Yours Romance Package" for our stay. When we arrived at the hotel, the staff was very friendly and approachable. The personalized key cards we received upon check-in were a wonderful touch. Each night, we would return to our suite to find the linens turned down and rose petals scattered across the bed. The personal concierge even helped me plan a special outing for my husband and I to see a Chicago Cubs baseball game. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a weekend away.
This is the best hotel to stay in when visiting Chicago. I travel a lot, both for business and vacation. The Talbott Hotel is a cozy yet stately hotel that is handsome, and elegant. Not to mention all the modern features that I'm used to having at home, are available in the room. I brought my wife on my last business trip and we stayed in the one bedroom suite. She didn't even want to leave the room. The concierge was especially helpful in finding us a romantic place to go for dinner. 
My stay at the Talbott was a wonderful experience. The service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations, the Gold Coast location is close to Michigan Ave, the museums, and many of the other sites Chicago has to offer.If you are visiting Chicago, I highly recommend the Talbott!
Great Hotel! The staff is friendly, corteous, and professional. They made me feel like I was a returning guest which I was not (but I will be!). The rooms were very clean and I slept well in the comfy bed. They have a complimentary workout deal with the nearby healthclub that I took advantage of several times since it was to cold to run outside. My only issue was the battery for the TV remote died. However, a call to the front desk remedied that situation in about 2 minutes! 5 stars!!!
I really loved my stay at the Talbott. My room was amazing! The bathroom (and I am VERY picky about hotel bathrooms) had ample room for all of my stuff, which is a bonus for me. The staff treated me really well and they were very friendly. I was afraid that I'd get a little lost, since it was my first trip to Chicago, but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area (Rush St./Michigan Ave.-- which are *very* close by). The hotel reminded me of those I'd stayed at in Europe. The room service is 24 hours, which for me, was a bonus because I am up mostly during the nights. This is the *only* place I will ever stay if I visit Chicago again. For a single woman traveling alone to a strange city, this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable.
This hotel was an absolute dream to stay in. I couldn't have picked a better hotel to spend in such luxury. I enjoyed the set up of the rooms and the space they offered.The room decor was extremely elegant and the location was great as well. I honestly felt like I was at a spa! The price was very reasonable as well. I would definetly recommend this hotel to everyone I know. If you ever get a chance to spend a night here definetly choose the suite rooms!!!
Very luxurious and worth the money. If you are looking to relax and unwind in a great hotel then this is the one to choose. The staff was great and friendly. Dont forget the 24 hour room service which is a great treat.
I was visiting relatives in Chicago and wanted to stay in a hotel that emphasized luxury and was also environmentally friendly, and the Talbott seemed to fit the bill. I also couldn't help but notice all the positive reviews online. I figured I couldn't go wrong and I am happy to report the positive reviews are true. First of all check in was a breeze. I love their online reservation system. It was easy to use and the information presented was quick and accurate. Once I arrived in Chicago I was greeted by Tim at the door and I immediately felt like wanted and liked. The receptionist was very polite and when she heard I was visiting Chicago for the first time, she upgraded my Deluxe King to an Executive King. Score! The room was just as advertised, luxurious and convenient. It was also exceptionally clean and this is very important to me because I am paranoid of germs and bed bugs. Most importantly though, I got a good night's sleeep because the bed and pillows were super soft, but firm enough to help support my back. I also used the Equinox Fitness Club and, wow, what a club. This is another great amenity of the Talbott and easily beats other hotels skimpy workout centers. My check-out was quick, easy, and painless. This hotel gets my highest recommendation. The facilities are immaculate and modern with the recent upgrade, the staff is ultra-friendly and competent, and the location was perfect for my needs. 
The Talbot hotel is an elegant place to take you wife or husband for a weekend getaway. The personally yours romantic package was fabulous. Upon check in we opened our room door and found a romantic atmosphere. There was rose pedals and luxurious bathrobes. We felt like it was our honey moon all over again. 
The atmosphere at the Talbott Hotel is very welcoming when you first walk in. The employees are friendly and will greet you when you first arrive. The hotel seems to be luxurious, even from the lobby, and right away, I was very excited for my stay! I stayed in a double queen room with my friend. The room is spacious enough, and beds are very comfortable. I didn't try the room service, but they do have a fitness club close by with a spa, which is very convenient. I also love how the room has individual climate controls! Very neat! Also handy that there is an iHome in the room. I'm usually stuck using just a regular alarm clock radio at other hotels. I will most likely stay in this hotel another time. It was a wonderful experience!
At first my husband and I were really excited for our family to enjoy the T-Rex Experience package. We figured it would be a great deal package even though the hotel itself felt too "ritzy" for us to travel with our four children. But after two nights of downtown Chicago fun we realized that The Talbott transcends it's ritzy look and truly embraces a family friendliness which we thoroughly enjoyed.
The rates at The Talbott Hotel were cheaper than I had expected, and that was my reason for booking a room. I had been prepared for service and a room similar to what I had experienced in the past, and I was quite pleased when I did stay. The room was neat and clean, and the halls were quiet at night. The traffic noise was muffled to the point where it was no problem sleeping either. I did ask one question at the service desk and they answered it nicely, which is good because normally hotel workers can be a bit snippy, especially at night. Overall I had no problems with The Talbott Hotel and I would stay at this here again if I were in the area a second time.
I enjoyed my stay at the Talbott Hotel. It is on the more expensive side, but it is all worth it. I got the Talbott tradition package, which was $245 for two people and included a $30 breakfast credit on check out day. The rooms are huge! The beds are soft and comfortable. They include Aveda bath products, which is a plus in my book. They also have a nice fitness area & pool you can use while you stay there. One thing I thought was really cool is that you can forward your messages from your hotel room phone to your cell phone. My boyfriend also liked the Ihome audio system. The location of this hotel is very convenient as well, its close to several great restaurants and blocks from the coast. But, what I like best about this hotel is that they make an honest effort to not negatively impact the environment more than they need to. They were one of the first hotels to be Green Sealed. Overall I had a great stay at Talbott Hotel!
Pleasant staff and housekeeping. Above average breakfast. The rooms were clean and the staff made sure we had fresh linnens. It was bedbug free!! I would definitely stay there again.
My stay at this hotel was one of the best I have ever had! The location, service and accommodations were all outstanding!! The lobby area is beautiful as was my room. In the room there was more than enough space, which is difficult to find in Chicago hotels. My only gripe was the room was a little dark. Sure, staying at a small, upper-class hotel like the Talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it. The service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed. The room service took a bit longer than I would have liked, however, the food was good quality. Another nice touch was the gym pass provided for guests at the Equinox Fitness Center. Finally, the location is PERFECT!! It's located in a beautiful area of the city near the Gold Coast, which has many very good restaurants. A personal favorite of mine is Mario's, a nice Italian place nearby. Overall, my experience at the hotel was good and while it had some minor flaws they were, for the most part, insignificant.
excellent staff and customer service, very clean and spotless. elegant and luxurious with a beautiful ocean view. the bed is very comfortable and relaxing. i give it a five star.
